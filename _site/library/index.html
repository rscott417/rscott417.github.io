<h2 class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-1zfy4p">Why doesn't deck culture scale?&nbsp;</h2><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-6l9gfo">I was talking to a friend who was early at a company that ultimately went public. He told me how the deck and meeting culture that worked at 300 employees started breaking once they reached thousands of employees. They ultimately needed to change their approach.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-6l9gfo">Some of this may sound familiar to anyone who has worked at a big organization: it’s impossible to have everyone in the room for each conversation. Endless meetings don’t seem to drive consensus or clarity. “<a class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-1wicq5s" href="https://sriramk.com/memos/completed-staff-work-thomas-watson-jr-ibm.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Immature oral presentations</a>” mean that important information isn’t communicated or absorbed. </p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-6l9gfo">When information isn't written down and shared widely, you end up with diverging perceptions of what is true. Like <a class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-1wicq5s" href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/seyer/files/plato_republic_514b-518d_allegory-of-the-cave.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Allegory of the Cave</a>, teams see the shadows cast by ambiguous presentations and ad-hoc conversations, and end up believing a projection of reality.</p><p class="framer-text framer-styles-preset-6l9gfo"><strong class="framer-text">If decks lead to lost context, good writing is near-lossless compression of ideas</strong>.</p>

          <p>Lovely quote from Eric Nehrlich on the Commoncog Forums:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Training%20modalities%3A%20Accelerated%20Expertise%20vs%20learning%20through%20prereqs%20-%20General%20Careers%20-%20The%20Commonplace%20Community" data-author="" cite="https://forum.commoncog.com/t/training-modalities-accelerated-expertise-vs-learning-through-prereqs/2602">
The basics of a CxO are about setting clear expectations, holding people accountable with direct feedback, prioritizing limited resources among many different conflicting priorities, and motivating or influencing people to execute on those priorities. But most executives think the basic skills are the technical skills that got them promoted, so they are “sparring” with the wrong set of basics and get beaten up pretty badly, and then blame it all on “politics”.

<p>Some thoughts on artist publishing:</p><ol><li><p>There are no rules about what can be an artist publication: a zine, a magazine, a book, an art-book, a pamphlet, a poster, a postcard, a set of letters. A website, a newsletter, an app, an e-book, a workshop or webinar, and/or a print on demand book distributed to bookstores (like with <a href="https://www.ingramspark.com/plan-your-book/print/print-on-demand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IngramSpark</a>). What you want to make can determine the right shape.</p></li><li><p><em>Artist publishing</em> is another way to think of it, rather than <em>self-publishing</em>. I’ve been feeling like it’s a more accurate description for a lot of what I’m interested in, and seeing my peers and collaborators do.</p></li></ol>

<p>Personal Library Science is defined as: <em>the discipline concerned with the organization, retrieval, and transformation of an individual's data.</em></p><p>The operative words here are: <strong>organization</strong>, <strong>transformation</strong>, and <strong>individual</strong>. Personal library science is focused on <strong>you and your data</strong>, not the existence of all data itself. More succinctly, personal library science is focused on <strong>your relationship with your information</strong>. How do we <strong>store</strong> information so that it useful at a later date? How do we <strong>transform</strong> our information into new valuable assets in different creative domains? How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of <strong>eight billion distinct individuals</strong>? How do we chronicle the information diet of a single person as they learn new things, interact with the world at different phases in their life? How do we make sure we can pass down our best knowledge to generations below? </p><p><strong>In sum, how do we manage the libraries of us?</strong></p>

          <p>What apartment number do I live in?</p>

<p>Its an innocent enough question that I would have been able to answer 1.57 seconds ago. Now - my heart is racing and my mind is working faster and slower than it has ever done and I’m trying to figure out if it’s apartment 2A or 2C that I live in.</p>

<p>You see - 1.57 seconds ago my access to the net went dark. Offline. Out. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Since birth I’ve had access to the net subcutaneously - implants under the skin just under my scalp able to communicate directly with my brain. Two arrays of gigahertz processors with microtech Bluetooth.</p>

<p>At least that’s what I’d have told you 1.57 seconds ago. Now I’m barely keeping my shit together trying to figure out if I can remember which apartment I live in.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I round the corner of Kayes Street and I’ve taken to muttering to myself - the silence in my own brain is a thunderous cacophony and unbearable. Muttering under my breath helps a little. Distracted by my own mumbling, my legs don’t have to question which apartment I live in - they guide me to 2A comfortably and my hands go into auto-pilot, placing the keys in the lock and opening the door. I’m glad at least part of my body has it’s shit together because my brain is an unreliable useless mess right now.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>It’s two hours later and I’ve dug up an old iphone - back before the microtech networks were two-way and instantaneous like how we used to use iphones to communicate. Now it seems laughably archaic but holding this slim piece of metal and glass in my hand I’m able to marvel at how slick a device this is and right now it’s a life saver. I rummage for a plug and put it on to charge. While it’s charging I look around my apartment and it’s like my brain is swimming through molasses. All of my memories, thoughts, ideas are like they’re half a second too slow. With access to the net everything happens instantly (or so it feels) - but now it’s like there are little men inside my head who have to go and retrieve files stored in cabinets and some cabinets are further away than others.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I’m back online. The glowing screen of the iphone gazes unflinchingly at me. I’d forgotten what this was like. I fire up blinkchat and am overwhelmed by the constant stream of updates and chatter - everyone is asking where I am, what happened to me and if I’m ok. As soon as I read an update, 6 more pop up on the screen. My stupid regular brain just can’t keep up - everyone else is sending these messages directly from their brains via microtech and all I have are these wet stumps of flesh called hands with which to type (type!) a reply out on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Am ok. Net went offline. Am home. All ok.</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn’t seem to appease the beast and my iphone crashes as continuous updates and notifications overwhelm the poor device. Jeez - is that what used to happen inside my brain? No wonder life feels so slow all of a sudden.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I write my apartment number on my hand, just in case, and head out for lunch. My favorite vietnamese place is just around the corner. I walk into the cafe and head up to the counter - somewhere in the back of my brain I’m marveling at the number of things that are happening simultaneously in my body, walking, thinking, looking. See, this old lump of flesh and bones isn’t so useless after all! I’m starting to kind of enjoy this disconnection when the realization hits me like a ton of bricks. I look around the cafe in a panic. All around there are people - people that look like me, eating, drinking talking and being NORMAL. But I’m stuck. I spin around - remembering that a few years ago they got rid of the people working here - everything runs via the net. As I spin around looking around and feeling cut off a roomba spins past me carrying someones food.</p>

<p>It’s ok, I’ve got this. I walk up to a couple in their late-20s. They’re eating pho. My favorite dish (I think?).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hi, excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt but my access to the net is down. Would you mind ordering me some food?</li>
</ul>

<p>As soon as the words are out of my mouth I realize what this looks like. I’m in a restaurant harassing customers, appearing like a madman, telling weird tales of being cut off from the net. The couple exchanges a glance - barely registering eye contact - and in that split second I realize that they have likely exchanged an entire conversation between them over blinkchat. My brain feels like a bike compared to their Formula 1 race cars. I feel my cheeks blush and I stammer something about being sorry to interrupt and rush out of the restaurant.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Hands deep in my jacket pockets I brace myself to the cold outside and walk fast down the street. I’m trying to make my brain go faster, better, to THINK dammit. What’s wrong with me? I can’t seem to focus at all - the dopamine loops in my brain have been optimized for so long to respond to instant, all knowing, information that I’m basically a nervous wreck without it. I imagine a mess of wires inside my brain all plugged into the wrong slots - connections firing without purpose, data flowing but me being unable to process the output. I imagine those poor guys pulling information out of filing cabinets in my brain. Sound the alarm! Red alert! We’re back in action fellas!</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>I’m still stung by the experience in the restaurant - the look in their eyes as they looked at me, through me - a horrific sub-human being incapable of ordering via the in-restaurant mesh. What happened to paper menus and human waiters eh? What was so wrong about all that?</p>

          <p>Descending into Iceland from orbit is breathtaking if you do it right. Often you can see the northern lights, the glaciers and the glass spires of Reykjavik all contributing to a stunning vista. On my most recent trip however an absence of solar flares and cloud cover meant that I sank into a dull grey fog as the cruiser landed in Reykjavik, as if the city hid some troubled thoughts. I certainly did.</p>

<p>I’ve been visiting Iceland for the past 12 months regularly to interview, in person, Layola - the first human being with DNA successfully manipulated via CRISPr technology. In 2018 Layola received advanced recombinant DNA configuration across her whole genome using CRISPr - essentially using natural machines made of proteins and RNA to artificially switch some of her genes on and off. The purpose of the procedure was to cure her severe autism and the procedure took 12 months of intensive treatment.</p>

<p>Layola was the first human to receive a CRISPr procedure and the only human to receive the procedure since.</p>

<p>There is no question that her autism was cured, and Layola will tell you she is happy with the outcome, but to call the treatment a success requires understanding the full effects of the treatment spanning Layola’s behaviour, her pre-frontal cortex, the inner workings of international medical advisory board (IMAB) and 50 years of quarantine in Iceland in a glass box and with limited contact with the outside world.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>In the period 2000 - 2018 Autism was a common diagnosis. Poorly understood, we lumped the condition with ADHD and tried to pinpoint the cause on vaccines, gluten sensitivity in diet, pre-birth oxygen flow, ambient 5G radiation and many more besides.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Layola was born in 2000 in southern New Jersey in a region called south shore - now completely submerged - to two parents, Marshal and Alice. Loving parents, a middle class family and a child with autism. First diagnosed at 4 because of early learning difficulties and later confirmed aged 7 because of extreme sensitivity to touch, a lack of all spoken language and avoidance of eye contact.</p>

<p>Aged 14 Layola was sent to a privately funded retreat - where she was supervised 24/7 by carers and given a secure compound to explore, play in and call home. What was going on inside Layola’s mind at the time was largely misunderstood at the time but her externalities were extreme. Severe self harm, extreme aversion to human contact, complete and utter dependency on specific sensory inputs such as sounds and colors.</p>

<p>In 2018, 50 years ago this week, Layola was selected and approved for CRISPr gene recombinant therapy.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>“I suppose, you could start with the words. That was the first thing I remember coming out of the autism. I had been processing sounds my whole life but never in any organized fashion - but to hear words and speaking as you and I are now - that was something entirely alien and foreign”</p>

<p>Layola speaks with a quiet confidence, at once soothing and calculated. Each word carries a pause behind it as if each word is selected based on it’s own merit, no word more or less important than the last.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>The facility where Layola lives is difficult to describe favorably - a modest secure building in downtown Reykjavik, once the cutting edge of design, connected grid-living and security but long surpassed by the technology companies now crowding the downtown skyline and subway advertising.</p>

<p>Still, every year the IMAB and the CIA renew their contract to secure the building 24/7 with an armed staff and every 5 years a carbon/neutron probing appraisal is made of the 20-foot thick concrete walls surrounding the building. Further security details, habits, quirks and insights that I’ve picked up visiting Layola’s home over the past year are omitted from this article at the request of the CIA.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>When I asked if she was happy in her home, there was a pause followed by the measured response of “I suppose I’ve never known more or less but all my needs are met and I remain content.”</p>

          <p>Below is copy pasted from an email to a good friend who’s teaching a course on entrepreneurship for political science students:</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of Gary Chou and his entrepreneurial design course. It drives home the making and launching aspect in really fun creative ways. He re-named it to <a href="https://postindustrialdesign.school/">https://postindustrialdesign.school/</a> - but you can find the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Zlq4nQ5BgR-dkOKGqLua7fLkblcLksCNeHnJPkQlvQ/edit">course online here</a>.</p>

<p>For political science students and working with institutions and organizations I highly recommend diving into the work of <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/">Helsinki Design Lab</a>. They have a few books available on print on demand I’d highly recommend: <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/studio-book.html">http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/studio-book.html</a>&amp; <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/legible-practises.html">http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/legible-practises.html</a></p>

<p>Also - for working with and inside government you should follow the GDS in the UK. They are slightly less radical now but they started as a very radical and interesting group. Their alumni is a list of amazing people. Not quite sure where to start but this is good: <a href="https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/">https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/</a> (and public.digital is the latest venture from some of the original GDS folks)</p>

<p>Lastly - you should put the course online! I’ve been <a href="http://www.wordsinspace.net/mapsmedia/fall2018/">following along remotely with this course</a> since pretty much the whole course is posted online. I think this open access / collaborative / blogging model is really powerful.</p>

What we’re seeking to do, is allow the situation, and the ecology of systems
within it, to be our guide and teacher (which, of course, is a lot about
becoming more aware — including aware of the perceptual and
interpretational traps we fall into…). And sure, we’re still going to be stuck
in tunnels of our own perception, if we don’t explore the system *with*
others — who have different experiences and vantage points from which to
perceive the (eco)system (of socio-technical systems), etc. This work can
help with convening and guiding the attention of that work.&nbsp;

        <div class="pv2">
          <p>I worked as a visual librarian when I was a young man living in Paris. A custodian of all the images, photographs, paintings and media humanity had produced.</p>

<p>My job paid pennies and the collection was poorly organized but I enjoyed spending my days unearthing and exploring the image library. Removed from the fast paced urban living this collection of images - most designed to excite and stimulate - were calm and serene. In between boxes of photos I would stumble on advertising slogans and catalogs of rejected logos. Life size prints of magazine covers. Dust motes in the air somehow the disjointed hyper-stimulating collection calmed me.</p>

<p>But frustration walked in the door one day in the form of the professor. I never learned his name but I did learn to despise him. Trained in architecture and working at an advertising and communications agency (while painting at night I came to understand) the professor exclaimed that he had seen every kind of image. No new images or visual media were left in his life. And he blamed me for being unable to find him new images.</p>

<p>His imagination he claimed was exhausted. There was no more progress possible. And it was my job to satisfy him. To present him with some image or style or visual that he had never seen before.</p>

<p>At first, as custodian and, humbly, expert of the visual archives I thought it a fun challenge to find something new.</p>

<p>Gaudi. Pointilism. Chinese architecture. A catalog of colors. Pinhole photography.</p>

<p>Everytime I brought the professor something he would take it in silence only to return the next week and proclaim that he had seen it before. Or that it was nothing more than a simple recombining of other derivitive forms.</p>

<p>A book of germs was my greatest mistake. A rare 1929 thick leather bound book filled with plates painstakingly photographed through a simple microscope I thought the images arresting and fresh and somehow more urgent and important than anything else I’d give him.</p>

<p>But when he returned with the book the look on his face was thunderous and he proceeded to lecture me until the sun went down and I missed my train home on the essence of originality and how biology and life was the most banal and reducible forms of image. Everything was biology! He exclaimed. These germs are the very mother of all images! I see them in literally every single visual scene I can imagine!</p>

<p>And he proceeded to tear down stacks of books and empty drawers of posters as he pointed and demonstrated what was to him the same image again and again and again.</p>

<p>My mind has not seen a new image in 20 years! Everything is but a shadow of what I have already seen! There are no new mediums and no new images! I fear we have reached the end of the visual medium!</p>

<p>And clutching his head he rushed from the library leaving me with nothing more or less than settling dust, a single dim light overhead, scattered books and images and the crushing emptiness left behind by the weight of the end of image.</p>

<p>Already late at night and with much tidying to be done (and anyhow as mentioned I had missed my train) I resolved to spend the night in the library. I would find an original image. I would search and strain until no image had been left un-looked at.</p>

<p>Slowly the library returned to order. I swept and cleaned and tidied as I went but slowly and methodically as I went row by row browsing and considering all materials. I vowed to find the orignal-image-needle in the library-haystack.</p>

<p>Eventually. With a tidy library and a fresh stack of items pulled and assembled from the archives I saw the sun peeking up out of the windows and I went home. Over tired and exhausted but quietly confident I had found original image. Surely they were obscure and to my eyes (young though I was) shared no lineage with images before or after.</p>

<p>All through that week the stack haunted me. I knew it was a promising collection:</p>

<p>A book on pirate flags from 1830 - written and illustrated by a real seafaring pirate.</p>

<p>The complete archives of a small accounting firm which included diagrams and doodles in the margins of the paperwork quite unlike anything I had ever seen.</p>

<p>A set of photographs that were untagged and unlabelled found nestled in between old magazines. I could not make out the subject or even how they had been taken but they possessed some quality that deeply unsettled me.</p>

<p>And finally, fresh the day before, the full rejected suite of marketing materials for a brand of men’s suits that folded before the marketing materials could be unveiled. Created by a young advertising student at a local University the marketing was at once bad and original. Too literal and boring while containing some desirable insight that made me want to question every fashion decision I had ever made.</p>

<p>The week passed like agony. Time dragging and my stack of materials taunting me with their immovability. Until eventually the professor returned.</p>

<p>He swept in Saturday afternoon. It must have been raining outside because his rain jacket was dripping and he had the air of someone who’s head has been ducked down to avoid the wind and rain.</p>

<p>Without stopping to take off his jacket or remove his hat the professor strode confidently into the library and with a small nervous nod from me picked up the stack I had prepared.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the tension in the air. Perhaps it was the rain outside and the professor did not want to leave. Perhaps it was simply the urgency he felt but the professor stopped at one of the tables by the door. My curated images in his hands, the rain dripping from his coat sleeves still he flipped quickly but methodically through the images. Making sure he saw every one.</p>

<p>I looked at him without breathing. Waiting with tension for his verdict.</p>

<p>Once he had finished the professor slumped back in the chair. A raindrop fell from his hat onto his cheek and rolled mournfully down his face as if the heavens were crying through him.</p>

<p>Enough. He said. Almost too quietly for me to hear. And then again. Louder.</p>

<p>Enough!</p>

<p>ENOUGH! How is it that there are no new images left! How is it that I am able to understand and anticipate and deconstruct every single thing you show me? Nothing here is more interesting than a row of grey bricks on an unremarkable house in a grey city of shallow visual boring nothingness!!</p>

<p>He was shouting now. And standing. Arms raised above him clearly aiming his frustration and anger at me but broadcasting at the same time to the gods in case they happened to be watching or listening too.</p>

<p>You might think this powerful man with some heroic ability to understand all imagery would have cowed me but something in me snapped. I had been dancing around this library for months attempting to please him and I had worked hard to discover original and obscure works but nothing had been good enough for him.</p>

<p>Taking the professors anger as my own I jumped to my feet shouting words that are now lost in history. Like a madman I was screaming. Whatever it was I said it clearly took him by surprise because he staggered back, taking the rain hat from his head with eyebrows raised.</p>

<p>But something had changed in me. I stormed to the nearest pile and started ripping and tearing up pages, taking posters and making confetti, turning books into crumpled balls of paper. Scientific papers filled with diagrams from hundreds of years before fell in tatters at my feet.</p>

<p>None of this sated my rage though and with temperature rising I continued to destroy and remove images from where they had been filed and bound and organized. I grabbed a pen - whatever had been at the front desk and I scrawled on the back of a shred of poster I had just destroyed:</p>

<p>Original never before seen images.</p>

<p>And then in a bundle under this “cover” page I shoved scraps of books, photograpsh, canvas, art, science, words, diagrams and every other thing.</p>

<p>As I assembled them I kept scribbling and writing putting words on and across and over the images. “Original”, “new”, “image” or on a photograph I would write “boring” and on a painting I recognized as a piece of cubist art on canvas I wrote “lines never seen”.</p>

<p>Eventually my whirlwind energy began to die and I felt physical exhaustion setting in. I took two large binding clips and bound my “book” together and thrust it into the professors hands.</p>

<p>There! I proclaimed. Original images!</p>

<p>And it was my turn to collapse into the nearest chair. Full and utter bone bending tiredness overtook me completely.</p>

<p>The silence hung in the air and eventually I looked up at the professor.</p>

<p>With a thin firm smile spreading across his face my eyes met his and we knew. Somehow. I had done it.</p>

  <p>And don’t concern yourself with whether or not you “write.” Don’t leave writing to writers. Don’t delegate your area of interest and knowledge to people with stronger rhetorical resources. You’ll find your voice as you make your way. There is, however, one thing to learn from writers that non-writers don’t always understand. Most writers don’t write to express what they think. They write to figure out what they think. Writing is a process of discovery. Blogging is an essential tool toward meditating over an extended period of time on a subject you consider to be important.</p>

          <p>Some personal wikis and sites that I’ve been inspired by:</p>

<p><a href="https://buster.wiki/">buster.wiki/</a> - Strong design and everything has a date by the looks of it which enables an RSS feed. Very polished and thought through.</p>

<p><a href="https://are.na">are.na</a> - A platform that all the cool kids use for building personal knowledge libraries. Lightly social, perhaps the right answer but slightly questionable if they’ll be around for a long time. Ymmv.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brendanschlagel.com/2017/11/05/canonize-creating-personal-canon-template/">Brendan’s /canon</a> - this was part of the original inspiration for me. A curated list of pure stock - things that Brendan returns to again and again. He has a template you can copy too.</p>

<p><a href="http://worrydream.com/#!/quotes">Worrydream’s quotes page</a> - just a massive list of interesting quotes collected by Brett Victor. Notice how being one giant page makes it instantly searchable.</p>

<p><a href="http://daywreckers.com/">daywreckers.com</a> - from Ben Pieratt, not quite a wiki but a very minimal site designed to collect the dots. A daily visit from me.</p>

<p><a href="https://sivers.org/dj">derek sivers’ daily journal</a> - a post from Derek Sivers on how to keep a text-file long-term store for your ideas and notes.</p>

<p>And there’s lots more too - <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1083823277712248832">this twitter thread</a> has a whole bunch of interesting rabbit holes.</p>

  <p>Prior to the fellowship the research I did was spontaneous and infrequent enough that my ad hoc system of typing out highlights by hand into a one or more markdown files and sorting through them manually worked alright. But now that I’m dealing with many, many more pages of research, this system has become kind of unwieldy.</p>

  <p>Here I’ll go over the tools I’ve built over the past couple years (most within the past year) to make this process more manageable. They are mostly meant to address a few key pain points:</p>

  <p>Aggregating highlights from across several platforms (phone, desktop, and eReader) into a central repository
Capturing charts and other graphics
Tagging and organizing highlights
Generating footnotes</p>

          <p>Gormen is my horizon and my home. This towering city of red rust stuck on the side of a dead asteroid. This crumbling outpost a legacy of a crumbling empire.</p>

<p>I am seven when the Computer chooses me as the next Controller of Gormen. Aghast, I rebel in the only way a seven year old can. I run away. Through the corridors and hangers of this decaying city of red rust, I flee. Pursued by a great horror that I can’t name but I can feel - I flee through the great hall where the daily meal is being conducted - hundreds of people dancing in a mad orchestra of routine and tasks to feed the workers - I flee still.</p>

<p>Through the lower levels the people of Gormen are covered in red dust, the red rust of this place literally killing them from the outside in.</p>

<p>You never truly escape the red dust but as you climb through the the levels of Gormen somehow the air becomes thinner, purer, less dust.</p>

<p>I run.</p>

<p>I flee through the sleeping chambers, where the bodies of dormant workers appear like hulking beasts. To me, they appeared non-human, grotesque perhaps. Vile. Noises and smells that my seven year old body, as yet, doesn’t understand. I flee past the air vents - constructions so big that I have to crane my neck to comprehend them. Their thundering noise is somehow calming to me - reassuring that this city is still breathing, still alive, still doing what it should. The mechanics of this community are alien to me - workers and machines and servants and the high court and the mess halls and the engineers and the scientists and cooks and… I don’t understand. I can’t understand - just like Gormen the meaning of this place is layered up - layers of people, metal, rust and routine.</p>

<p>I run.</p>

<p>As I ascend Gormen to the higher levels, the noise retreats and is replaced with the glow of lighting that is too bright. Too false. The people are no longer covered in red rust but their eyes reflect the false light. They are empty and lifeless - motions devoid of the quickness and primal qualities of the workers of the lower levels. And yet here there is less rust. Less dust in everyone’s hair, in everyone’s clothes.</p>

<p>The library. A place I’ve been many times for education but never on my own. I see the librarian coming towards me and truly see with my eyes the monstrosity of a creature half man, half machine. Oil sheens on his metal surfaces while his human eyes burn with a look of knowledge that appears demonic. A creature who has traded form for knowledge - to give up his humanity to become all-knowing. All knowing and ponderous. I can easily outpace him and this, finally, gives me my first taste of freedom. These upper levels are steeped so thickly in tradition and etiquette that it is as if the whirling system of people and things move only in regimented movements, a limited finite way of being - destined to repeat infinitely again and again their movements and conversations.</p>

<p>Still I run.</p>

<p>I lose my way more times than I can count - dead end passages, locked doors, great halls that are colder than death itself. I stumble into a room filled with dancing lights, flickering and beautiful but when I see the faces of the trapped people - wired from every part of their body and a state of rapture on their faces, drooling and muttering and smiling and laughing an empty sickly laugh, I turn and flee. Those faces haunt me as I stumble on - still running and still scared but now I have been running for so long that I am feeling free - the solid pounding of my feet on the metal floors of Gormen reassuring me that this is physical and real.</p>

<p>What characters will there be in this story? The spiders of Gormen - the computersâ€™ eyes and ears forever creeping on, and over everything. The rust, of course. Spick who will become my best friend from the miners - his infectious laugh and real human energy in his eyes but lacking the understanding of education. Mervyn - my assistant and mentor forever faithful but forever lacking, bound to the rituals and mechanics of the system. And Braun - the first voice in the senate and the puppet master of the upper levels. But there is plenty of time for that.</p>

<p>Still I run.</p>

<p>Down a long, narrow corridor I emerge into the observation deck. A hundred windows blazing with the radiance of the carpet of stars in the night sky. It will take me years to find this place again, and the next time I see it somehow it won’t be as beautiful as this time. Seven years old and heir to the whole of Gormen, I am able to put aside the looming dread and gaze out across the surface of the moon. Is the towering construction of metal and people Gormen or is the moon Gormen? Where does one truly end and one truly begin? I can look out over the valleys and mountains of the moon - everywhere tinged the same red color - and look up at the stars. Like pinpricks in the curtain of night, they hang motionless and yet twinkling. I am tired and lie down to rest. Rest perched on the very edge of Gormen - as far from the belly of the beast as I can manage. Many miles overhead the machines we call crows wheel and toss in some imaginary wind buffeted by space and tracing some pattern known only to the Computer. I feel for the crows out there in space with no air and no heat. How can those machines not lose their minds? Already my brain is confusing humans and machines - already my perception of things is losing it’s grip.</p>

<p>I will look back many years later, once I have become the Controller truly and know every chamber, every air vent and every crack in this majestic ruined place - once I understand how the rituals work and how the machine functions - the system made of humans and metal, of brains and computers. I will look back and wonder what did I know of Gormen as a seven year old? Gazing out from that observation deck - what did I know of the true nature of Gormen? This spiraling city of red rust. Perhaps, I will think, I knew it better at that age than I ever did again.</p>

  <p>Bergman and Whittaker report that many of us use hierarchical folders for our personal digital organizing. Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it. Because of this, information scientists suggest other methods: search, more flexible than navigating folders; tags, which allow multiple categorizations; and group information management. Yet Bergman and Whittaker have found in their pioneering personal information management research that these other methods that work best for public information management don’t work as well for personal information management.</p>

Instead of proving human when it neared
And someone else additional to him,
As a great buck it powerfully appeared,
Pushing the crumpled water up ahead,
And landed pouring like a waterfall,
And stumbled through the rocks with horny tread,
And forced the underbrush–and that was all.</p>

<p>I prove a theorem and the house expands:
the windows jerk free to hover near the ceiling,
the ceiling floats away with a sigh.</p>

<p>As the walls clear themselves of everything
but transparency, the scent of carnations
leaves with them. I am out in the open</p>

<p>And above the windows have hinged into butterflies,
sunlight glinting where they’ve intersected.
They are going to some point true and unproven.</p>

Before a local sense has jelled,
From talking-site to talking-site
Am jet-or-prop-propelled.</p>

<p>A Winter Night
Tomas Transtromer</p>

<p>The storm puts its mouth to the house
and blows to get a tone.
I toss and turn, my closed eyes
reading the storm’s text.</p>

<p>The child’s eyes grow wide in the dark
and the storm howls for him.
Both love the swinging lamps;
both are halfway towards speech.</p>

<p>The storm has the hands and wings of a child.
Far away, travellers run for cover.
The house feels its own constellation of nails
holding the walls together.</p>

<p>The night is calm in our rooms,
where the echoes of all footsteps rest
like sunken leaves in a pond,
but the night outside is wild.</p>

<p>A darker storm stands over the world.
It puts its mouth to our soul
and blows to get a tone. We are afraid
the storm will blow us empty.</p>

<p>Sometimes Writing
-Pat Schneider-</p>

<p>“Sometimes writing sits in you
like a wild animal. Maybe
you see its eyes.
Maybe you don’t see it at all,
but the hair on the back of your neck
knows it is there
where the deepest shadows lie.
Often the shadows lie
about what’s hiding in them.</p>

<p>The panther that has stalked you
since you were a child
is old now. No longer wild,
and tired of guarding the treasure
you yourself left behind–
blind and deaf, she will give it all to you
if you just let her go.</p>

<p>But how are you to know
whether the fox on the hill
in the cemetery carries your mother’s name
or is the same fox you saw
crossing your back yard in the snow</p>

<p>unless you put your pen to paper
and use it to release the animal
that hides in the shadow of your hand.”</p>

  <p>RNDRD is a partial index of architectural drawings and models scanned from design publications throughout the 20th century. We do not publish photographs of completed work, only renderings: drawings, collage, models and graphics of all sorts. Our source materials are (mostly) out-of-print academic and trade journals. We cull the most striking, typical and atypical images from thousands of pages of print that will not be available online. As the internet increasingly becomes the main source for designers to draw on precedence, RNDRD hopes to provide a broader sample of the history of architectural image making.</p>

  <p>Once cities were designed to accommodate the masses; today the masses have to be seduced. During the past forty years, like all sectors of the economy, urban planning has become free enterprise: a perpetually speculative activity, which must give shape to developments even if it remains uncertain whether those developments will ever happen, or attract the people for whom they were planned.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This presentation explores the flipside: large urban plans that were built but never used. These now occur on every continent – the inevitable fallout of a world urbanizing at a staggering pace. But perhaps they are more… perhaps these towns also constitute compelling reasons for reflection in the face of a seemingly unbreakable consensus that the city is our one and only common future.</p>

          <p>A set of projects / ideas for making blogging (aka networked writing) easier and in particular easier to start.</p>

<p>1) Create an open blog export standard</p>

<p>Does this exist? Doesn’t seem like a natural place to start but interop of blog platforms is a key barrier to…</p>

<p>2) Simple places to start</p>

<p>Things like blot.im are easy but how much do you get trapped in them? Interop allows for super simple onramps that then become easy to transfer to github or wordpress or ghost.</p>

<p>3) RSS facelift</p>

<p>Subscribing to RSS feeds sucks in the year of our lord 2019. Why? How can we re-energize adoption of RSS</p>

<p>4) Re-brand RSS</p>

<p>Run a kickstarter to raise funds for a design exploration around RSS to reenvision the RSS icon, workflow, and to create RSS-branded merch (Ben Pieratt would be the DREAM person to work on this)</p>

<p>5) Create the “bloggers way” course</p>

<p>A 12-week course and set of cohorts that sign up for learning how to blog.</p>

<p>If you give me seed money I’ll get 1,000 new blogs online.</p>

<p>Other ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some kind of small-b analytics. How can you tell the right people are reading?</li>

          <p>I’m very interested in new ways of networking writing. You can see some thoughts on that in my post <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/01/05/networked-writing/">experiments in networked writing</a>.</p>

<p>Most of my thinking on annotations is contained in this post: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/12/annotations/">exploring the UX of web-annotations</a></p>

<p>–</p>

<p><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a> is the best in class at the moment but still has a long way to go. It feels robust but without a strong UX (especially so on mobile where it almost entirely fails).</p>

<p><a href="https://crowdlaaers.org/">https://crowdlaaers.org/</a> is an interesting looking tool that provides a dashboard for a URL (with they had the ability to do a whole site) to show how many annotations there are, from who, over time.</p>

  <p>As the mega-galleries continue to battle for market share, Gagosian, most often cited as the world’s largest gallery, is beefing up its technology team. Today the gallery shared exclusively with ARTnews that it has hired as a part-time senior adviser Sebastian Cwilich, the co-founder of Artsy. (…)
Gagosian’s tech department is a relatively recent addition to the gallery, the result of its hire last year of a chief technology officer in Gareth O’Loughlin, formerly the vice president of technology at Casper, the mattress startup.
“Gareth and Sebastian are both leaders in the field, with a broad range of skill sets and unique perspectives on technology, business strategy, and operations,” Larry Gagosian, the gallery’s founder, told ARTnews in a statement. “They will be great additions to the gallery, enhancing and expanding our innovative work.”</p>

  <p>Things that I want to write more about: sunlit nature, and being outdoors in nature, especially in places that are cold and snowy. The difficulty and monotony and odd joy of getting better at something. Groggy morning runs. Loving yourself fully and expecting that same standard of love from other people—because God, self-loathing is boring. People who make completely different choices than I do and have completely different values, but are nevertheless very happy. How they think about meaning. The ecology of our changing planet and the adjustments we’ll have to make to adapt and survive. Navigating objectification, and learned self-objectification, in a society that places great value on female beauty and youth. How to communicate clearly and kindly in high-stakes situations. Technology and its effect on productivity. Strange possible worlds. Fear, vulnerability, loss of control. Surprising statistical truths. Small things that give me joy: the smell of lemon, rain and freshly-cut wood, un-sexualized intimacy, inventive and engaging movies, children in motion.

  <p>In Robert’s account, as in Geoffrey’s Historia, Merlin is created as a demon spawn to become the Antichrist and reverse the effect of the Harrowing of Hell. This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin’s power to shapeshift,[note 1] on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells.</p>

  <p>Magical practices offer heightened expectations and altered experiences of both magicians and participants in a variety of performances and in “qualified places,” from Davos, monetary policy committee rooms, and courts of law, to concept restaurants, fashion runways, and award ceremonies. The study of magic in contemporary society privileges forms of charismatic explanation for phenomena, rather than rationally “explaining away” curiosities. Indeed, “magic is alive and well” (Masquelier 2004: 95) and adds to our growing enchantment of modernity’s—and capitalism’s—global reach.</p>

          <p>I’m such a sucker for the insider baseball of CMS’s. How do they work? What do they look like? Where’s the innovation?</p>

<p>I’ve been involved in consulting for a variety of different CMS projects over the years so I’m always hungry for little details that make a difference.</p>

<p>Also increasingly the enterprise CMS market is getting more advanced and is (finally) outpacing the consumer Wordpress market.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since strategy has almost inevitably been conceived in terms of what the leaders of an organization ‘plan’ to do in the future, strategy formation has, not surprisingly, tended to be treated as an analytic process for establishing long-range goals and action plans for an organization; that is, as one of formulation followed by implementation. As important as this emphasis may be, we mould argue that it is seriously limited, that the process needs to be viewed from a wider perspective so that the variety of ways in which strategies actually take shape can be considered. For over 10 years now, we have been researching the process of strategy formation based on the definition of strategy as ‘a pattern in a stream of decisions’</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company’s nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it’s not thinking straight, that the organisation isn’t put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.</p>

<p><a href="https://artofgig.substack.com/p/knowing-which-nut-to-tighten">Venkatesh proposes</a> that consultants get bought in when “monitoring costs” (in the coeasean theory of organization) are too high. I.e. a new type of work or one that the org does infrequently so has no way to efficiently monitor the quality of work.</p>

<p>This maps well to my idea of ways of seeing - i.e. teaching clients how to see the work is another way of saying teaching clients how to monitor the work. Dashboards rule everything around me.</p>

<p>Clients have problems that they describe as “I don’t know how to build this” when what they mean is “I don’t know how to measure this”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WAR-type statistics track well with the increased emphasis on personal rather than organizational productivity that Melissa Gregg describes in Counterproductive, her study of time-management self-help trends. In that discourse, ‚Äúproductivity isolates and sanctifies the actions of individuals. It elevates an elite class of worker beyond the concerns of mundane others.‚Äù Productivity fetishism suits a society of free agents who must continually renegotiate the terms of their value, their viability, their irreplaceable contributions; it not only provides a rationale for employers to sort contract workers, but it provides those workers a way to frame their achievement in the absence of a stable association to a particular job or a particular set of co-workers. More and more of us are perpetually in the position of a baseball player facing an arbitration hearing. We cast everyone else as the replacement-level people that we are besting with our superior performances. To garner proof of that, we‚Äôre more likely to tolerate increasingly invasive forms of surveillance that can document our accomplishments and chart our personal growth on whatever metric is necessary, whichever seems to give us leverage over the competition, if not the employers.</p>

  <p>Learning results from the adaptive and manipulative interactions between an organization and its environments: experimental actions are important because organizations rarely master their environments so that they can develop lasting optimal responses… Long-term survival calls for surveillance of opportunities, whereas short-term coping concentrates upon problematic search. Most organizations have much of the latter and little of the former (Thompson, 1967). Yet, if organizations are to survive in hostile and changing environments, they must change strategies and pursue new development patterns.

  <p>Finally, we place great emphasis on making the thinking tangible, following my colleague Bryan Boyer’s phrase, making strategy you can see. This might well be sketch videos, which we’ve used with great success, or a real emphasis on drawing in order to flush out damaging ambiguity and crisply illustrate genuine possibility. And, if we’re talking documents as a deliverable, we ensure that it’s strategy that you might actually want to read, in a format you might actually want to read it in.

  <p>Many beginning consultants have a weird kind of insecurity that leads them to invent and rely on over-complicated, bespoke constructs that they can name after themselves. While these can sometimes be useful, especially ones that are developed and refined over many years, across hundreds of applications, such as Wardley maps, in general, they are fragile visual bullshit. You’re much better off learning to use the basic commodity diagrams well than trying to make up and sell your own in most cases.</p>

  <h1 id="sketching-science-in-the-seventeenth-century"><strong>Sketching Science in the Seventeenth Century</strong></h1>

  <p>What constitutes a sketch? We think at first of drawings and diagrams, but there are other forms of sketching. The OED offers several pertinent uses of the term, none of them earlier than the late 17th century. The first refers to the visual arts: “A rough drawing or delineation of something, giving the outlines or prominent features without the detail, esp. one intended to serve as the basis of a more finished picture, or to be used in its composition; a rough draught or design. Also, in later use, a drawing or painting of a slight or unpretentious nature.” The second extends it to literary creations: “A brief account, description, or narrative giving the main or important facts, incidents, etc., and not going into the details; a short or superficial essay or study, freq[uently] in pl[ural] as a title.” A third, rare usage, makes a sketch simply “[t]he general plan or outline, the main features, of anything”. One can find all three sorts of sketches at work in the formation of the new science of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p>Collective Wisdom is a first-of-its-kind field study of the media industry, that maps works that live outside the limits of singular authorship. While the concept of co-creation is entering the zeitgeist, it is an ancient and under-reported dynamic. Media co-creation has particular relevance in the face of today’s myriad of challenges, such as the climate crisis and threats to democracy. But it is not without risks and complications. In this study we look at how people co-create within communities; across disciplines; and increasingly, with living systems and artificial intelligence (AI). We also synthesize the risks, as well as the practical lessons from the field on how to co-create with an ethos grounded in principles of equity and justice. This qualitative study reframes how culture is produced, and is a first step in articulating contemporary co-creative practices and ethics. In doing so, it connects unusual dots.</p>

  <p>“Rappers got their start by releasing rawer, uncut mixtapes to the streets. These tapes were more frequent, less polished, and had samples we knew damn well weren’t cleared! But once the artist got popular, their studio albums were more polished, had radio-friendly singles, big-name producers, and a slow song or two to broaden appeal.</p>

  <p>When artists focus on albums and stop making mixtapes (or mixtape-type music), they risk losing the audience that fueled their rise. But if artists stuck only with mixtapes, there’s a higher chance they might never breakout. Doing both allows them to grow while staying true to their roots. That’s why Lil’ Wayne’s run from 2005-2009 was so iconic. He released classic mixtapes and albums to maintain both audiences.”</p>

          <p>Nothing about his job was rewarding for Jonah. He worked day and night at the quantum observatory research lab attached to the New Frontier science outpost orbiting Aries12.</p>

<p>Our understanding of time and space have changed in the last 100 years, what begun with relativity, was extended through quantum mechanics and then later entangled-thermodynamics upended our notions and our understanding but ultimately very little changed in our day to day. Yes we were able to master short wormhole transportation but only in isolated channels through our solar system, at short distances from the energy harvester orbiting the sun.</p>

<p>Using this we catapulted a short number of expeditions to some of the nearest stars and inhabitable planets around Earth.</p>

<p>It was on one of these space hops that Jonah and Franny fell in love. 30 years ago. Both quantum scientists they spent their entire education learning how to entangle molecules, only to end up entangling each other in the emotions of love.</p>

<p>But Jonah was destined for Aries12, and Franny for Aries13. And with a limited distance using the hops from our home solar system Jonah and Franny are separated for the rest of their lives. Without even any means to communicate other than radio waves with a 20-year lag. And, of course, the entangled beacons.</p>

<p>12 in total, designed to withstand the ravages of space, stabalised in 5 dimensions using a combination of magnetic and gravitonic fields. These entangled beacons are linked outside of space/time. Across space/time. Using space/time. Really, it’s impossible with our understanding still to determine HOW entanglement works. But work it does. Instantly. So Aries13, 20 light years from Aries12, itself 10 light years from Earth. Each with a series of entangled beacons capable of communicating 12 bits of information in total. 1 or 0. But able to communicate instantly.</p>

<p>The game theorists on earth had calculated a complicated matrix of scenarios, and an associated chart of communication patters guiding the use and interpretation of these quantum beacons. So far two beacons had been used. One signaling that Aries13 was indeed habitable, that all was safe and that resources were abundant and one signaling that resources had stabalised and colonization had begun.</p>

<p>But of course you can’t leave two amorous quantum scientists together for 10 years on a lonely voyage through space without expecting them to entangle themselves. Both literally and metaphorically. You see in addition to the 12 “official” quantum beacons Jonah and Franny had created 5 entangled particles, held in simple crude quartz chambers</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to develop — both among library patrons and librarians themselves — new critical capacities to understand the distributed physical, technical and social architectures that scaffold our institutions of knowledge and program our values. And we must consider where those infrastructures intersect — where they should be, and perhaps aren’t, mutually reinforcing one another. When do our social obligations compromise our intellectual aspirations, or vice versa? And when do those social or intellectual aspirations for the library exceed — or fail to fully exploit — the capacities of our architectural and technological infrastructures? Ultimately, we need to ensure that we have a strong epistemological framework — a narrative that explains how the library promotes learning and stewards knowledge — so that everything hangs together, so there’s some institutional coherence. We need to sync the library’s intersecting infrastructures so that they work together to support our shared intellectual and ethical goals.</p>

  <p>In 2019, nearly twenty years into the modern gig economy, constructing our identities primarily in terms of how we relate to the paycheck folkway is no longer good enough. After all, there is a good chance the gig economy will outgrow the paycheck economy, relegating the latter to a minority sector of the economy overall. Imagining our future in relation to the future of paycheck work would be like early industrial age workers imagining their future in terms of the future of farming. Much of the supposed “future of work” thinking I see around the gig economy strikes me as the equivalent of early factory workers worrying about where to park their cows.</p>

  <p>So the gig economy needs to outgrow its origin story in the paycheck world. For the gig economy to grow from limited sideshow to full-blown folkway, we need to talk about a lot more, and develop much deeper internal realities and subjectivities.</p>

  <p>I think the question of whether or not to outsource curatorial practice is a good opening to discuss the broader practice of outsourcing in general in the cultural heritage sector. It certainly easier for more people to relate to than the question of whether or not we should outsource digital and technology roles. This is a larger debate that we, as a community of practice, should have because I think that one risk of relentless outsourcing is that museums (and friends) will become nothing more than centers of production rather than scholarship.</p>

  <p>If we say that our only purpose is to facilitate the assembly of content in the service of culture then it’s no longer clear to me what distinguishes the cultural heritage sector from any other for-profit entertainment company. If we are unable to articulate, even to ourselves, what distinguishes our work from that produced by the private sector then maybe it really is time to admit there’s nothing special about what we do. And importantly there are other people who do it — where it is pure and selfish entertainment — better than we do.</p>

          <p>So much of consulting is not “having the answer” but helping everyone get to the answer together. It’s about exploration and process as much as it’s about expertise and “being right”.</p>

<p>To that end - I’m fascinated by this idea of “small groups consultancy” from Matt Webb:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a couple of things I’m investigating:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) That a small group is a powerful way of thinking, and of creating action. That repetition matters, and informality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) It might be possible to help with strategy without providing original thought or even active facilitation: To consult without consulting. The answers and even ways of working are inherent in the group itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My hunch is this: To answer a business’s strategic questions, which will intrinsically involve changing that business, a more permanent solution than a visiting consultant might be to convene a small group, and spend time with it, chatting informally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve really got to read the whole post here: <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2015/10/07/small_groups_and_consultancy">Small groups and consultancy and coffee mornings</a>.</p>

<p>Open questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of problems need this “small groups” approach?</li>
  <li>How do the commercials work? Who gets paid what? Who has incentive to make this work?</li>
  <li>What other models exist outside of traditional consulting?</li>
</ul>

<p>I had never thought so obsessively about poetry as I did when I was learning about syntactic linguistics.</p>
<p>There were different kinds of verbs, my professor had told me. If John threw a ball, that throwing was a doing. But if John loved Mary, my professor stressed that, within the structure of the sentence, John served as what was called an “experiencer” of the emotion of love. Loving was not a doing — syntactically speaking, of course. He drew for us two diagrammatic trees that demonstrated how the nature of a doing or experiencing verb influenced how the sentence was modeled in our internal understanding of language.</p>
<p>There is poetry in constellations, and poetry in patterns of birdsong, but this class was how I learned about the poetry that inhabits the formal structures of language. Was the professor aware of the symphony he was plotting out on the blackboard? He was composing out loud a striking thesis on what it meant to perform the act of love, or, indeed, to simply be the experiencer of some cosmic feeling. I was desperate to learn more, especially if the professor continued to explain these concepts in a way that inadvertently sounded like a poetic proclamation.</p>

<p>And I was thinking, actually, about conversations between my wife and me. I was thinking, more precisely, about conversational “space.” We are two whole universes connected, anchored by very deep connection, but there are a thousand books worth of experiences that belong to one of us alone. You spend 17 years together and we know the easy paths to each other. They are well-marked, assiduously maintained, no poison ivy. But how much more are all of us  — are the hillsides — than the well-worn trails? </p><p>Every person on this earth is a monstrously huge landscape, and yet, we can drop into any of it with a simple incantation, the right string of words piped through this sparse interface. At a bus stop, taking in two dogs playing, paying for a muffin—you might unveil a secret path to walk for a year or just a few feet. I have been blessed with my mother’s gift of easy connection to others. But what is the nature of that gift? It’s saying: hey, that seems interesting, wanna go there? As simple as stepping off the trail to point out a mushroom.</p><p>Anything can open up a hillside to explore. But often, it is the components of conversations that open up the rest of me: an unexpected question, someone else’s lingering shower thought, a feral conjecture about the world, free empathy, a true thing offered, a scrambled memory reassembled in real time.</p>

          <p>A URL is a radical act… I love these presentation notes on museums, the cultural sector and the web. Lots to mull over:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="%5Bthis%20is%20aaronland%5D%20sometimes%20expectations%20happen%20to%20you" data-author="" cite="https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2022/06/17/expectations/#usf">
<p>One of the reasons I think these considerations are so important to the cultural heritage sector is that the act of revisiting is the bedrock underlying the whole idea of cultural heritage itself. The act of re-reading a book, or re-listening to a piece of music or of going to see the same painting or sculpture again and again and of celebrating the evolution of an understanding about those works is what separates cultural heritage from entertainment. Entertainment, born of the moment, can and does become cultural heritage but it is precisely through the act of revisiting that one becomes the other.</p>

<p>The web simply makes those acts of revisiting possible for more people, in more ways, than ever before. When I say these things are possible I mean that the economics of participating in this global network of documents are within the reach of, if not everyone, then more people than ever before. These things become possible because technologies underlying the web are simple enough to meaningfully lower the barrier to participation and unburdened by licensing in a way which allows people to share their work and for others still to extend that work to meet their needs.</p>

<h3>%FIRE: Frustrating image-render experience</h3>
<p>In addition to all the text updates people share, we have a lot of photos shared on Threads. When images load slowly or not at all, that can cause someone to stop using the app. That’s why we monitor an important metric to alert when there’s a regression in how images are loading for our users. That metric, %FIRE, is the percentage of people who experience a <b>frustrating image-render experience</b>, and it’s calculated as shown in Figure 1, below.</p>
<p class="fig"><img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-22061" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="541" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png 1848w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?resize=916,484 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?resize=1024,541 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?resize=1536,811 1536w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?resize=96,51 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threads-iOS-performance-figure-1.png?resize=192,101 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw" />Figure 1: %FIRE calculation.</p>
<p>All kinds of things can regress %FIRE, both on the client end and the backend, but not all image-rendering bugs are covered by this metric. For example, in Threads iOS, we had a bug earlier this year where user profile photos would flicker because of how we were comparing view models when reusing them. That triggered a frustrating user experience, but not one where users would contribute to %FIRE.</p>

<p>While this kind of self-directed learning sounds nice, the research seems to suggest that guided instruction works better! This is a tension to solve - bringing in more grounded theory of how people learn into the buzzy hype-driven space of L&amp;D and corporate learning environments</p>

          <p>What a magical lush book. Ugly, raw, squelchy. The opposite of the Ruth Ozeki book I just read… Popisho is full of exquisite descriptions, magical realism, surreal nonsense and raw, bloody, colorful magic. Full of gods and humans at their best and worst I absolutely loved this book. If you’re looking for something that is a riot of color, emotion and humanity then this is it.</p>

          <p>While at times Ruth Ozeki’s writing is lyrical and magical, mostly this book felt kind of sterile. Neither of the main characters feel deeply explored and the most interesting characters (the aleph and the bottleman) are really only side events. Overall the book tasted like it had been aged in steel barrels and I was left wanting something more full bodied, more lyrical, more vivid.</p>

          <p>A URL is a radical act… I love these presentation notes on museums, the cultural sector and the web. Lots to mull over:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="%5Bthis%20is%20aaronland%5D%20sometimes%20expectations%20happen%20to%20you" data-author="" cite="https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2022/06/17/expectations/#usf">
<p>One of the reasons I think these considerations are so important to the cultural heritage sector is that the act of revisiting is the bedrock underlying the whole idea of cultural heritage itself. The act of re-reading a book, or re-listening to a piece of music or of going to see the same painting or sculpture again and again and of celebrating the evolution of an understanding about those works is what separates cultural heritage from entertainment. Entertainment, born of the moment, can and does become cultural heritage but it is precisely through the act of revisiting that one becomes the other.</p>
<p>The web simply makes those acts of revisiting possible for more people, in more ways, than ever before. When I say these things are possible I mean that the economics of participating in this global network of documents are within the reach of, if not everyone, then more people than ever before. These things become possible because technologies underlying the web are simple enough to meaningfully lower the barrier to paricipation and unburdened by licensing in a way which allows people to share their work and for others still to extend that work to meet their needs.</p>

<p>Fieldnotes encompass more than drawing, and as we use fieldnotes ourselves, our understanding of what they are and how others might use this method, develops.</p>
<p>We start our series of <em>Fieldnotes for Design</em> with drawing &amp; sketching. Further editions explore mapping, writing, data collecting, sound recording and the field itself.&nbsp;<em>Fieldnotes for Design Volume 1: On drawing and sketching</em> has been self-published in a small run.</p>
<p>Our approach is poetic; it relies on unexpectedness, happenstance, gesturing and evoking, rather than pointing and telling. We expect our readers to skip, dip, sigh, tut, smile, shuffle skim, muse and shift between our pages, producing a cacophony of responses.</p>

          <p>Oof. That concludes reading all 16 of the realm of the elderlings books. I haven’t kept detailed notes on them but I’m so glad that I read them all and read them in order. In many ways Nighteyes is the main character. These last three books tie together so many threads and loose ends - the storyline is dark but the ending is magical. Robin Hobb has such a powerful command of both small characters and giant worlds.</p>

Like: you make a zine, you make a digital file, you make a book. I guess one thing that changed for me with Michael Warner's [piece] was the idea of setting something into motion and forming a public through its circulation, and through the discourse that's created around that movement.</p><p>I started thinking about publishing in gestural and performative ways where that action, when you make objects move—sometimes literally physically moving from hand to hand or library to library et cetera, or on the network from server to sever—that is where the public, or a public, or multiple publics are being formed. That can happen with anything.</p>

          <p>Some nice reflections on working at Github - I especially love this meditation on working on a big project that got cancelled:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Six%20Things%20I%20Learned%20in%20Six%20Years%20at%20GitHub" data-author="" cite="http://sophieshepherd.com/six-years/">
<p>My first takeaway here is to always look at product decisions through this lens of time. Why is this important now? What else is happening in the product or with competitors that could hinder this? Are we putting too much effort into this too soon?</p>

<p>My second takeaway is to rethink the concept of shipping all together. We sometimes put too much importance on shipping, when deciding not to do something is often the harder, and smarter, decision—and should be celebrated. With so much weight on shipping The Big Thing, we forget how important it is to work incrementally. If it felt like we threw a lot of work away, did we bite off more than we could chew?</p>

<p>And last, it has taught me the importance of storytelling, documentation, and leaving a record of your work. People come and go from companies, but good ideas remain. Leaving time capsules of your thinking and learnings will ensure that your ideas live on.</p>

Making a spreadsheet is very pale work next to making a product or a painting, and they remain secondary and supplementary to the needs of the actual product or business they describe. But since they are one of the artefacts we use to theorise and then direct the activity of fifteen people, I try to make them with diligence and even some craft.

New DLs are also required to offer a much richer set of services to their
users than in the past. In particular, they must support the activities of their users
by providing functionalities that may range from general utilities, like annotation,
summarization or co-operative work support, to very audience-specific functions,
like map processing, semantic analysis of images, or simulation. The availability of
this new DL functionality can, in principle, change the way in which research is
conducted. By exploiting such types of DL, for example, a scientist can annotate
the article of a colleague with a programme that extracts useful information from a
large amount of data collected by a specific scientific observatory. This
programme, executed on demand when the annotation is accessed, can
complement the content of the paper with continuously refreshed information.<div><br /></div><div>In the new DLs users are not only consumers but also producers of
information. By elaborating information gathered through the DL they can create
new information objects that are published in the DL, thus enriching its content.
The new DLs are thus required to offer services that support the authoring of these
new objects and the workflows that lead to their publication.&nbsp;</div>

          <p>Why do learning and play seem locked in opposition sometimes? When it’s through play that we do our best learning…</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Edutainment? No Thanks. I Prefer Playful Learning" data-author="Mitchel Resnick" cite="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/edutainment.pdf">
Let me start with a contrarian point-of-view: I don’t like edutainment.<div><br /></div><div>What do I mean by that? Am I a stodgy professor who wants to keep play and fun out of the
learning process? Certainly not. In fact, my research at the MIT Media Lab focuses on ways to
integrate play and learning. I have found that many of people’s best learning experiences come
when they are engaged in activities that they enjoy and care about. Based on these ideas, I
have helped develop new toys that provide children with opportunities to learn as they play (and
play as they learn).
<br /><br />
So why don’t I like edutainment? The problem is with the way that creators of today’s edutainment products tend to think about learning and education. Too often, they view education as a
bitter medicine that needs the sugar-coating of entertainment to become palatable. They provide entertainment as a reward if you are willing to suffer through a little education. Or they
boast that you will have so much fun using their products that you won’t even realize that you
are learning—as if learning were the most unpleasant experience in the world.

          <p>Lonliness is a real threat.</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="How%20Loneliness%20Is%20Damaging%20Our%20Health" data-author="@nytimes" cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/nyregion/loneliness-epidemic.html">
The human brain, having evolved to seek safety in numbers, registers loneliness as a threat. The centers that monitor for danger, including the amygdala, go into overdrive, triggering a release of “fight or flight” stress hormones. Your heart rate rises, your blood pressure and blood sugar level increase to provide energy in case you need it. Your body produces extra inflammatory cells to repair tissue damage and prevent infection, and fewer antibodies to fight viruses. Subconsciously, you start to view other people more as potential threats — sources of rejection or apathy — and less as friends, remedies for your loneliness.

<p>This kind of insight is validated by this long Harvard study. In particular, it’s not just that relationships matter - but the quality of relationships in midlife…</p>

The study showed that the role of genetics and long-lived ancestors proved less important to longevity than the level of satisfaction with relationships in midlife, now recognized as a good predictor of healthy aging. The research also debunked the idea that people’s personalities “set like plaster” by age 30 and cannot be changed.

<p>One way out is to strengthen our trust in institutions and communal care. Not to give people support but to ask them for support:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="How%20Loneliness%20Is%20Damaging%20Our%20Health" data-author="@nytimes" cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/nyregion/loneliness-epidemic.html">
“For years people thought the best thing you could do for a lonely person is to give them support,” she said. “Actually, we found that it’s about receiving and also giving back. So the best thing you can do for someone who is lonely is not to give them help but ask them for help. So you give them a sense of worth and a chance to be altruistic. Even if we’re getting the best care, we still feel lonely if we can’t give something back. The care is extremely valuable but it’s not enough.”

          <p>Lovely little meditation and exploration on custom workflows, software and tools to enable high level research:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="My%20Mathematics%20PhD%20research%20workflow" data-author="" cite="https://castel.dev/post/research-workflow/">
Earlier this year I started a PhD in pure mathematics at KU Leuven in Belgium and in this blog post I discuss my research workflow. I talk about how I take daily notes, both handwritten ones and ones in LaTeX and how I handle references, featuring a way to instantly add clickable references to my notes.

Education is never a neutral process. It either functions as an instrument to integrate new generations into the logic of a present system, or it can be the means by which students are allowed to critically deal with their reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their future—in other words, education as a practice of liberation. No matter what we believe, we all should at least be transparent about our approaches. Every student should have the right to know what kind of learning processes they are about to enter.And of course, one is more likely to support education as a model of integration if one benefits from or has never felt threatened by the status quo. In this case, this system is likely invisible to you. In liberatory educational practices, it is as important to recognize one’s role as an educator as it is to identify and name power. This should never be confused with freeing yourself, as a teacher, from your responsibilities. Even if I believe in co-created knowledge and use methods to make individual experiences and knowledge visible, it is my responsibility to organize studies in ways that increase each student’s chances to reach learning outcomes. If a student fails, this failure is also mine.

It’s impossible to tell <em>good</em> jokes about subjects you don’t fully understand, and very difficult to tell jokes that people with opposing opinions will enjoy and grapple with. To accomplish the latter you need to be informed enough about opposing opinion, generous enough to take it seriously, and above all confident enough to tell a joke that, taken at face value, inverts your actual opinion. This is shitposting.

          <p>The connection between walking and attention….</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Observers%20of%20the%20In-Between" data-author="@ianvanagas" cite="https://ianvanagas.com/2021/10/22/observers-of-inbetween/">
<p>There are places in-between the spaces we live. We rarely “see” them, but they are there.</p>



<p>I’ve realized many of my favourite writers, video makers, and photographers are constantly exploring this space in-between. They travel and then observe the space between where they start and finish. Their destination doesn’t matter, it is someplace you’ve never heard of. It is about the journey through the in-between. You might enjoy their work too—they include <a href="https://intellectualinting.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Arnade</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDZs_ltFFvn0FDHT6kmoXA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bald and Bankrupt</a>, <a href="https://craigmod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craig Mod</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoWizard (Tom Davies)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm325cMiw9B15xl22_gr6Dw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beau Miles</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXwMqnXfJzazKS5fJ8nrVw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiey</a> and more.</p>



<p>Where they go and what they see isn’t “normal.” It is not big cities or popular attractions. For Bald and Bankrupt, it is an obscure historical Soviet site. For GeoWizard, it is the endpoint on a straight line across a whole country. For Craig Mod, it is a small cafe along a Japanese walking route. They do a lot of walking. As the slowest form of transportation, this allows them to do something special: observe.</p>

Now I find myself more mindful of the sun as I continue to tinker with the site. It never occurred to me before as I used and created on the web. But I think that is what makes Smith's idea of the feral web so intriguing. The web can feel isolated from the world around us, sometimes to a point of debilitation. However, whether your site is powered by solar panels or by a data center, there are many ways we can make the web  respire at natural rhythms.

          <p>“A blog is always good enough” - lovely</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Useful" data-author="Russell Davies" cite="https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/2022/03/useful.html">
<p>I've recently wondered whether I could just dispense with the coffee stuff and share the whole collection in some useful way. And I've been wondering how to get it all together. I tried <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrivener</a>, so it could be a book and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roam</a>, so it could be networked and modern and <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian</a>, so it could look like a spaceship. But none of them seemed to stick.</p>
<p>I even tried building webpages festooned with links and tags like I was building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xanadu</a>, but I've <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read about that</a>.</p>
<p>So I gave up.</p>
<p>And then, the other day I found myself saying to someone "<em>Just do it as a blog, it's never exactly what you want, but it's always good enough.</em>" And that reminded me of these lines from <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/6364/9781785043710" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Change by Katy Milkman</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>In psychology, there’s something called the “saying-is-believing effect.” Thanks to cognitive dissonance, after you say something to someone else, you’re more likely to believe it yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>So I'm going to saying-is-believing myself and just stick stuff on here, collect it all together and add thoughts it I have them. And then we'll sort it all out later. A blog is always good enough.</p>

          <p>So there’s a <a href="Digital Naturalism Conference">digital naturalism conference</a>. Looks pretty rad! They made a booklet from their last conference in 2019 which you can <a href="https://archive.org/details/dinacon-2019-single-page-lulu-a-5-printed-2/">see online here</a>. Looks fascinating!</p>

<p>Reminds me of this wonderful project from Simon Colly, the <a href="https://colly.com/work/internet-of-natural-things">internet of natural things</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Work%3A%20Internet%20of%20Natural%20Things" data-author="@colly" cite="https://colly.com/work/internet-of-natural-things">
<p>This self-assigned research project led to a popular newsletter, numerous articles, a touring presentation, and R&amp;D projects. But what does ‘Internet of <em>Natural</em> Things’ mean? Well, throughout history, societies have collectively reinvented their <em>image</em> of nature, so it’s logical that we are now defining a new image of nature for the post-digital age. And with that comes a new and more authentic idea of beauty that designers can embrace.</p>
<p>The research has many strands. I’m exploring biophilic thinking in art, design, architecture and emerging tech. There’s great overlap with mental health and wellbeing. I’m particularly interested in the ways data and social media help us track animals, invest in them, and crowdsource their stories. I’m fascinated by how all of these strands coalesce to influence culture and aesthetics.</p>
<p>I want to understand how nature can play into a better relationship with digital technology, and how technologists and designers can work with, not against, the natural world. The guiding idea is not that we need less technology, but that we need <em>more nature</em>.</p>

<p>A design history looks both forwards and backwards. New posts show the team where a service is going, while older posts tell the story of how we got to where we are now.</p>

<p>I think a lot about blogging, about why I like it, what I think I can accomplish through blogging that I can’t accomplish, or not easily anyway, through other kinds of writing … and that leads me to metaphors. For instance, I have appropriated from Brian Eno and others the distinction between architecture and gardening, and <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/the-blog-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have described my blog as a kind of garden</a>. But lately I’ve been revisiting the architecture/gardening distinction and I have come to think that there <em>is</em> something architectural about writing a blog, or can be – but not in the sense of a typical architectural project, which is designed in advanced and built to specifications. Rather, writing a blog over a period of years is something like building the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Towers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watts Towers</a>:</p>

          <p>First, Brian Lovin on a perspective around incrementally correct personal sites:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Incrementally%20correct%20personal%20websites" data-author="@brian_lovin" cite="https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websites">
<p>Incremental correctness is the process of iterating towards something more truthful, accurate, usable, or interesting. The faster we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but tomorrow things can be slightly closer to perfect.</p>
<p>Incremental correctness changes everything about the way you work. It's anti-perfectionism. It's pro-generation. It's about discovery and proof, research and prototyping, and having a framework to reliably test your instincts. It discourages major redesigns, preferring isolated improvements to a small subset of nodes in any kind of working tree.</p>
<p>I've always struggled to have this mindset when working on my personal website. I get stuck in these loops where I redesign the thing once every few years, and am left so thoroughly exhausted and frustrated by the process that I don't want to touch the thing ever again. If you've ever dreaded the notion of having to redesign your portfolio, you probably know what I mean.</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Frank%20Chimero%20%C3%97%20Blog%20%C3%97%20Homesteading%202014" data-author="Frank Chimero" cite="https://archive.ph/2013.12.27-041357/http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/">
Have you ever visited an architect’s house, one they designed themselves? It’s fun to walk through it with them. They have so many things, arranged so thoughtfully, and share the space with such pride because of the personal reflection the house required to design (not to mention the effort it took to build). It’s really quite special. I think there’s a pleasure to having everything under one roof. You feel together, all of you at once. In a way, building your own house is the ultimate project for a creative person: you’re making a home for what you think is important, done in the way you think is best.

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="On%20Publishing%3A%20Graphic%20Designers%20Who%20Publish" data-author="" cite="https://onpublishing.page/">
The notion of a singular printing or edition obviously goes out the window when readers can recombine and print on demand as desired. "The book" in this context has to encompass all the machinery, the HTML and CSS, the server, the underlying content, the templates for the pages, the code to collate them, and the means of printing. Drawing attention to its own publishing to a degree a more traditionally constructed book might not. This is particularly visible, I think, on the cover for the on-demand print version of <em>On Publishing</em> where the logic of: "randomly place logos of those studios that have been included in this particular compilation so they do not overlap at one of a number of sizes" spans fifty lines of code that form the canonical notion of the cover.

People often ask what they can do to generate original contributions or comparative advantages. Usually they vastly overestimate how common it is to have gone through the basic intellectual background in a field. If you've actually read the book (actually checked the proof, actually implemented the algorithm), you're probably way ahead of the field. Much expertise is simply doing this over and over.

Maps are not simply means of sharing our work publicly. They are a central part of our inquiry process. They allow us to share our individual thoughts, explore connections and work collaboratively. Our daily work often involves moving between projects and holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously, and maps serve as a vessel for retaining that information. Different team members can enter a project, introducing new ways of thinking and spotting a host of new connections.

<p>(Paper <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1410784719592214536">via here</a> and freely available with a Google)</p>

<p>Some interesting insights from this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintaining an active list of “open questions” might make you more creative. Is there a way to reframe your general interests into a list of questions? I did something a bit like that with my <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/01/06/jan-22-map-inquiry/">areas of inquiry</a> post recently</li>
  <li>Doing things leads to questions leads to creativity leads to doing things…. There’s a nice virtuous cycle here where finding specific problems - i.e. specific questions leads you into a positive cycle of curiousity and creativity…</li>
</ol>

<p>Update: I wonder if there’s value in a little tool/prompt/exercise that encourages people to convert their general, abstract interest into a set of active questions. I have a hunch that if you can push people into a question mindset they can be more focused, more creative, less distracted and more likely to spend time on their interests….</p>

          <p>I’m thinking about Libraries - both literal, physical existing libraries AND conceptual future digital “libraries”.</p>

<p>Especially in the context of my <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/">library.json project</a> how can we ensure that a project all about books can funnel value back to libraries?…..</p>

<h4><strong>The library of the future</strong></h4><p>You might be saying to yourself: but aren’t all the libraries already built? What’s the next frontier? This brings us to our final can of worms in this series: <strong>What would a public library look like on the internet?</strong> This question is so intriguing, yet so complex and nuanced, that many of you had a lot to say on the subject last week in our most engaged <a href="https://newpublic.substack.com/p/tuesday-open-thread-libraries/comments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Open Thread</a> in months. Some of you thought that anything attempting to replace libraries digitally was inexorably doomed to fail, and others were eager to bring their favorite features of their library — from shushing librarians to storytime — to some corner of their daily digital routine.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe this conversation is just getting started. We did a Library Design Sprint with librarians, designers, and researchers in summer 2020, and we tracked how Brooklyn Public Library went online early in the pandemic in our <a href="https://newpublic.org/study/1465/terra-incognita-nyc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Terra Incognita project</a>. This is a topic we’re still extremely interested in, and I’m looking forward to revisiting it in future newsletters. If you have a vision for the intersection of technology and libraries, we’d love to hear more about it in the comments, even if you’re not a billionaire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CFT asserts that due to this nature of ill-structured domains, cases are <em>as</em> if not <em>more</em> important than concepts. This second idea is a more subtle one, so we’re going to spend a bit of the time examining the implications.</p><p>I think many of us have been exposed to a particular style of teaching in school, where we are taught a concept, and then the examples that illustrate that concept are treated as disposable. My go-to example for this is how we are taught quadratic equations — we are shown one or two examples and then we are expected to memorise the general approach for solving such equations. As a result of this instruction, many of us internalise that concepts are important and examples are not.</p>

<p>From your description, and from what I know of your previous work and your ability; the work you are doing sounds very good “Drawing – clean – clear but crazy like machines, larger and bolder… real nonsense.” That sounds fine, wonderful — real nonsense. Do more. More nonsensical, more crazy, more machines, more breasts, penises, cunts, whatever — make them abound with nonsense. Try and tickle something inside you, your “weird humor.” You belong in the most secret part of you. Don’t worry about cool, make your own uncool. Make your own, your own world. If you fear, make it work for you — draw &amp; paint your fear &amp; anxiety. And stop worrying about big, deep things such as “to decide on a purpose and way of life, a consistant approach to even some impossible end or even an imagined end.” 
You must practice being stupid, dumb, unthinking, empty. Then you will be able to DO</p>

This virtualisation occurs in the context of the porous borders between the individual and the collective inherent in corporate subjecthood, whereby the anthropomorphisation of the corporation and the corporatisation of the individual combine to dissolve the border between inside and outside, creating a networked subjectivity.

As I’ve said many times before, I completely agree with Yuval Levin that it is indeed <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Time_to_Build/yjebDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a time to build</a>&nbsp;(or rebuild) our institutions, but the problem is that nobody <em>wants</em> to rebuild the institutions and they don’t want to rebuild them because they don’t <em>care</em> about them, they don’t <em>value</em> them, they don’t see what purpose they serve; for them an institution is simply an impediment to the achievement of their desires. In this kind of environment, I don’t see the rebuilding of the institutions as an <em>immediate</em> possibility. Americans today perceive institutions as repositories of resources for them to exploit.

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Post Artifact Books and Publishing" data-author="Craig Mod" cite="https://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/">
<p>As I stated before, <strong>we will always debate:</strong><br />
<em>the quality of the paper, the pixel density of the display;<br /> 
the cloth used on covers, the interface for highlighting;<br /> 
location by page, location by paragraph.</em>
</p>
<p>This is not what matters. Surface is secondary.</p>
<p>The ditch digging,<br /> the setting of steel,<br /> the pouring of concrete for the foundation of the future book.<br /> <em>This</em> is what requires our efforts.</p> 
<p>Clearly defined scope of these systems,<br /> clearly defined open protocols.<br /> <em>These</em> are what require our discussion.</p> 
<p>Tools with simple, quiet, clean interfaces<br /> organically surfacing our changing relationship with text.<br /> <em>These</em> are what we need to build.</p>
<p>All of these efforts combined, these systems integrated,<br /> these tools made well and deliberately.<br /> This is the future book.<br /> Our platform for post-artifact books and publishing.</p>

<p>We still haven’t solved all of this but I love thinking about the future of the book. Especially the practical notions of how to make both web and print books in 2022 (a pragmatic concern for me!)…..</p>

<p>More soon</p>

          <p>A framework for writing online. This is a nice short video from David Perell</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0WdJuEvHO8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I especially like the ABCD framework for feedback. Asking specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A - What’s awesome?</li>
  <li>B - What’s boring?</li>
  <li>C - What’s confusing?</li>
  <li>D - What didn’t you believe?</li>
</ul>

<p>That last one is key - writing is so much better when you strengthen the foundations and address people’s assumptions directly.</p>

<p>I too dislike the phrase and framing of “tools for thought” but don’t have something better.</p>

<p>I would like to tackle the term "enchantment" head-on, expand its definition, and provide a sense of where it exists in modern life without relying on these historical forms or terminology.</p>

<p>My working definition: "enchantment" is a property of experience where the subject projects a fantasy, in the broad sense, onto the experience itself. Enchantment as such elevates the experience beyond its mere factual or physical essence, and brings it into a "super-sensible" relation with the actor. To use Fristonian terminology, the degree to which an experience is enchanted is the degree to which top-down priors predominate over bottom-up.</p>

<em><strong>Creatures Are Stirring</strong></em><strong> is a book about how to be friends with buildings. </strong>Through a collection of flash fictions (written from buildings’ points-of-view), creative essays, and case studies, the book re-conceptualizes buildings as our intimate companions by amplifying architecture’s creaturely qualities—formal embellishments, fictional enhancements, and organizational strategies that suggest animal-like agency. In an unsettled world, such qualities may initiate more companionable relationships between humans and the built environment, and ultimately foster greater solidarity with other human and nonhuman lifeform

<p class="typl8-drop-cap">We sat atop Parliament Hill as the sun went down, London lapping at our feet, glass of wine in hand, a hard red line on the horizon fading not to black but the glow of LED streetlamps diffused through the humid breath of our ten million neighbours. </p>
<p>The distant whine quitened as the drones returned to their charging towers. The apartment buildings, shadowy, took over with their rumbling murmerations.</p>
<p>“That one,” said K—, and I followed her finger to one particular termite mound, apartment containers crawling over one another, a slowly seething self-stirring pile, reconfiguring according to the occupants’ preferences this week and the up-to-the-microsecond spot rent.</p>
<p>“There’s a patch of apartments that are blocked,” and indeed there was: a 3D mass at the heart of the mass, visible sometimes, not moving. A scab. A tumour.</p>

<p><em><strong>They are the complex restructuring of technological waste with mechanical and electronic systems that are configured as artificial life organisms with the ability to survive in urban environments.

A new dimension has opened up. Until now writing has been more or less Of The Moment. As Google has punished me for not supporting their various <a href="http://this.how/googleAndHttp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hijacks</a> of the web, the writing has become more ephemeral, kind of like Twitter -- once written -- hard to find again. With Daytona all of a sudden my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memex</a> has memory. My writing is upgraded a billion percent.

<p>Makes me think about ways to upgrade search as a more powerful primitive on my own site….</p>

<p>Right now I’m using a version of <a href="https://gist.github.com/cmod/5410eae147e4318164258742dd053993">Craig Mod’s search script for static site</a> and it’s fine. Functional but not really transformative.</p>

<p>Instead I’m thinking about a new /search page that pulls together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog archive (obvs)</li>
  <li>Notes archive via microblog API</li>
  <li>Full tweet archive (I’d self host a copy of my own tweets to do this)</li>
  <li>My wiki and saved notes</li>
</ul>

<p>Making <em>everything</em> searchable feels like fun and it might surface some nice things….</p>

<p><strong>Update 12/14</strong>: Hmm I just downloaded by twitter archive and tweet.js is 50MB so it’s not going to be practical to host and search that everytime someone uses my search box….</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This report argues that consumer technology reviewers have failed their basic nominal purpose of critiquing tools. Instead, inspired by values introduced by Apple in the late 1990s, the tech review industry prioritizes aesthetic lust as the primary critical factor for evaluating objects. The reification of these values in their scoring system is transmitted to consumers and manufacturers alike. Like other prurient things, the objects designed within this paradigm are optimized not for usefulness but for photogenic and telegenic properties, a framework that finds its fullest realization in YouTube reviews and unboxing videos. There, even the intimation of critical rigor within tech reviewing vanishes, the smartphone becomes the center of gravity, and manufacturers are even further incentivized to design products for end consumers who are less users than viewers.</p>

Google caused a stir in the affiliate sector with its April algorithm update. The latest update promised better rankings in Google searches for websites with product reviews and product testing that include unique and useful expert content, while affiliate sites focusing only on clicks and commissions rather than providing the user with added value would be downgraded. So far, the update has only been rolled out for English-language Google search where some major changes have already been seen.

<p>It’s not lost on me that I am writing an <a href="https://colly.com/articles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article</a> about my <a href="https://colly.com/stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream</a>. But, as you will read, this isn’t a short post, and my Articles section is here when I need more depth. I’ve given myself options.</p>

<p>Writing all this down, you know what? I'm kind of mad about it too. Not so mad that I'll go chasing obviously-ill-fated scurrilous rainbow financial instruments. But there's something here that needs solving. If I'm not solving it, or part of it, or at least trying, then I'm... wasting my time. Who cares about money? This is a systemic train wreck, well underway.</p>
<p>We have, in Western society, managed to simultaneously botch the dreams of democracy, capitalism, social coherence, and techno-utopianism, <em>all at once</em>. It's embarrassing actually. I am embarrassed. You should be embarrassed.</p>

Growing up, I've always been mesmerized by people I perceived to be “moths” — humans fluttering around just outside of the bright glow of the traditional spotlight. While “butterflies” sparkled within traditional systems, moths seemed to be playing games entirely of their own making. I believe both human and insect moths are frequently underestimated. They're just as smart as butterflies (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/02/19/145532/why-even-a-moths-brain-is-smarter-than-an-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or an AI</a>, for that matter), <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/nature/464151/Incredible-pictures-show-close-ups-of-moth-wings-looking-like-kaleidoscope-of-colours" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beautifully complex up-close</a>, and driven by a magical intrinsic force: agency.&nbsp;

<p>Reminds me of Nadia’s helium grants program:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Advice%20on%20starting%20a%20microgrant%20program" data-author="Nadia Eghbal" cite="https://nadiaeghbal.com/microgrants">
<p>I ran a personal microgrant program called <a href="https://www.heliumgrant.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helium Grants</a> for two years. After reading ~4,000 applications and awarding nearly $40,000 in grants to 26 people, I’ve decided to put it on indefinite hiatus and focus on other projects.</p>

<p>Since starting Helium, I’ve gotten questions about how to start a microgrant program, so I figured I’d capture my learnings in one place. Some of this advice overlaps with previous posts I’ve written; this one is my best attempt at a cheat sheet.</p>

<p>I’d love to start a micro-grant program to get people zero -&gt; one for blogging. How to encourage people to start a (small b) blogging habit…….?</p>

<p>There was a long dark evening of the soul where I toyed with the thought of ploughing on regardless. Amy and Sonia put me right and made me see sense: there was no point doing all this work for an end result that <em>may or may not</em> be a decent printed product. </p>

<p>This was the moment where I realised I couldn’t go ahead with the process I’d planned. I couldn’t rely on these printers to print good books. All that work to get the book magically connected to the book distribution industry had been wasted time. It was time to think of a new plan.</p>

          <p>From the great album by Sam Fender. This lyric has crushed me recently - I keep seeing this idea everywhere.</p>

<p>From yelling at my kids to watching people behave angrily on the subway… Anger is such an insidious force that just destroys people from the inside out.</p>

<p>There’s always room to breathe. Don’t pay your anger forward.</p>

After reading so much poorly written sci fi recently (Dune, The Ministry of the Future, Exhalation..) this was a refreshing breath of fresh air.</p>

          <p>What a magnificent - truly epic work. I’m a big Steinbeck fan already and I think I even read this one previously but loved immersing myself in this wonderful story. The biblical theme is almost too strong at times but is richly counterbalanced by Steinbeck’s incredibly loving character portraits. Amazing.</p>

          <p>While the writing style at times is captivating - like a penny falling into a deep well - often the writing was unremarkable and the plot unfolded fairly slowly. All in the book was, ironically, forgettable. That said - the ending, where bodies start to fade away really resonated during this period of lockdown and isolation - it captures the essence of my embodied self fading away into an infinite series of zoom screens.</p>

          <p>I think perhaps I made a mistake. I didn’t realize until after I’d read it that it was part of the Borne series. Maybe that would have been useful because this book made zero sense. Like a William Burroughs book it was somehow interesting and riveting at times despite literally making no sense. Did I mention it makes no sense? The first section with the three astronauts was the most compelling….. Maybe I should read the other Borne books and it’ll make more sense? But I doubt it.</p>

          <p>Amor is a wonderful writer with so many lyrical touches, flourishes and turns of phrase. The feel of the book of politics, culture and acting in the proper way is great. Without posting spoilers there’s a few themes in the book that make me feel like the book was written by a man - that some of the more emotionally rich moments are skipped over… But overall highly recommended as a fun, engaging and lyrical book.</p>

          <p>A delightful little book that was a gift from my friend Brian. A little meditation on conversations, how important they are and some of the explicit and implicit ways they can go wrong. At first I thought this was going to offer solutions and ideas but mostly it just offers poetry and provocations. I think it’ll stick with me for a long time though - and the art from the author scattered through the book makes a lovely little object. Thanks Brian!</p>

          <p>A fast-paced, high-action read. A fun time-travel romp with some great characters. Ultimately I thought the premise was smart and the writing handled it well but the whole novel felt a little shallow. There were some really meaty ideas about identity and family wrapped up here that kind of got sidelined for the sake of the technology-driven plot and I thought that was a shame. Fun read though.</p>

          <p>Lovely vintage sci-fi recommended by Chris Butler. There’s aliens, teleporting and… magic? But nothing flashy happens - it’s an incredibly human story. This is a really thoughtful and fresh story. Highly recommended.</p>

          <p>The opening line of Idiot’s First is a masterpiece. ‘The thin ticking of the tin clock stopped’. Loved a few of the other stories but some were definitely forgettable. I’d recommend dipping your toe in and at the very least reading the title story Idiots First.</p>

          <p>Ah what delicious sludgy, dark, human texture. China Miéville’s descriptive language and world building is unparalleled. This is book two (after reading Perdido Street Station last year). These books are long and luxurious so perhaps not the best entry point if you’re new to his writing but if you like this kind of thing there’s nothing better. My only quarrel with this book was the ending… It felt somewhat unsatisfying, or rather unfinished - where a typical book resolves this felt like the open sea was still in front of you? But it’s a very minor comment as mostly the strength of this book was that every page told a lifetime of texture. Definitely going to read book three of this trilogy after a break.</p>

          <p>The core idea of the masks - the cartoonist, the director, the hacker and the emissary - is wonderful and a new lens to look at the world through, so overall I’d recommend the book. But there was also an incredible over-indulgence from the author to live inside his own worlds (which feels very finite game like, not infinite game like). And the lack of people anywhere in his worlds is also problematic. That said - the book as an object is beautiful and wonderfully designed.</p>

          <p>I really enjoyed this - a delightfully British story of being trapped, like a combination of Kafka and PG Wodehouse. The plot derailed itself in a few places and there was a whole Shakespere reference that kind of went over my head but the writing was wonderful. Recommended.</p>

          <p>I really loved this. Distinctive, fresh writing that captures so much of the present weirdness in society while also somehow feeling timeless. The middle third dragged slightly for me but the descent into ecological weird towards the end is just wonderful and reminds me of the Annihiliation series by Jeff Vandermeer. Oh and the whole book centers on this premise of artists becoming ‘consultants’ which is magnificent. Recommended. Verdict- 👍🌲</p>
