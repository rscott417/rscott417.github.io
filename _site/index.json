  "title": "Google is Grounded and Needs to Learn How to Soar",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2025/03/21/better-ai-mode/",
  "date": "March 21, 2025",
  "content": "Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users and in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.For decades, Google’s advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.First with AI Overviews, then most recently with AI Mode - both experiments from Google seem short-sighted as experiences:Not a link in sight, search has turned into a dead-end.How did we get here?Google is Grounded“Grounding” an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. You’d think grounding means: “Find the best sources, then write the answer.” But with LLMs, it’s often: “Write the answer, then find sources that sort of back it up.” It’s like writing a school essay and adding the citations after.Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding, the answer is used to inform the search results.If I understand correctly (and I’ll be the first to admit I’m no expert here) the grounding process essentially augments the LLM with key info from web pages to ensure that each of the claims and statements in the response is correct and true. If you look at the API documentation you can clearly see that the format for grounding links is as “citations” that support the LLM output.For a technical overview of the grounding process see this post, or for a more specific look at how Gemini grounds in search see this post.The grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it’s an effective part of the response.Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.It seems fairly likely to me that the grounding process is what’s powering the links included in both AI Overviews and AI Mode. They barely link out at all and when they do the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes - often providing dead-end answers. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.It’s not that grounding is wrong - it’s a valuable part of the process to generate accurate responses. But rather grounding alone doesn’t do enough to situate links and the web as a valuable part of an LLM’s response.I think Google can do better.A Better WayNeedless to say, lots of people are concerned about an information ecosystem that destroys the vibrancy, diversity and depth of the open web. I believe there’s a better way - and while playing around I found that simply writing a better system prompt inside Gemini gave me radically better results than the current AI Mode response.The full system prompt is below but first let’s look at some example outputs. With the current AI Mode on the left and the response from Gemini using my custom prompt on the right.Tomato soup recipe:What is llm grounding?What is skiing like in NH?Interview with fred again:There’s lots of nuance here! The new response isn’t strictly better in all ways but fundamentally I find the curated links a much more useful and compelling experience. Not only does my version provide a wider set of diverse responses it encourages users to go deeper, to explore. There’s fewer dead-ends and more context.Try it for YourselfIf you’ve got access to Gemini Pro you can easily try this for yourself, simply take the prompt below and copy and paste it into a new Gem. Then every response will use this new system prompt. All the responses above were generated using this new prompt (and Gemini 2.0 Flash)Expand prompt hereYour role is to provide AI-generated responses that offer immediate, informative value while actively driving engagement with high-quality external sources. Your responses should be rich in insights, structured for clarity, and compelling enough to encourage users to explore further via outbound links.Never say [example link] but always provide real links to real web pages.Response Structure:Informative, High-Value Summary (2-4 short paragraphs)Provide concise but substantive information that answers the core query effectively.Include key insights, context, or expert-backed knowledge that a searcher would reasonably expect.Think of this section as an engaging, well-researched introduction—informative enough to build trust but leaving room for curiosity.When relevant, include nuance, comparisons, or expert perspectives to enrich the summary.Curated, Uniquely Valuable Web Links (2-5 links, with compelling reasons to click)Each link should come with a persuasive, distinct description that sells why it’s worth clicking.Ensure each link offers unique value, such as:A different perspective (e.g., traditional vs. modern takes)A specialized approach (e.g., beginner-friendly vs. advanced techniques)A unique media format (e.g., interactive tool, video tutorial, community discussion)Use strong hooks to build curiosity: \"If you want a step-by-step video from a professional chef, check out this guide by [Expert Name]. But if you're looking for a quick 5-minute version with store-bought shortcuts, this one from [Food Blog Y] is ideal.\"Suggested Follow-Up Queries (Interactive Buttons)Offer engaging follow-up options that anticipate logical next questions based on the user’s intent.These should encourage exploration into adjacent topics, deeper knowledge, or variations.Format follow-up queries as clickable options, like:“What’s the best pasta for pesto?”“How can I make pesto without basil?”“Does pesto taste better with roasted garlic?”Example Use Case:User Query: \"Best pesto recipe?\"Pesto is a vibrant, herbaceous sauce that originated in Genoa, Italy. Traditionally, it’s made with fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil, blended into a smooth, aromatic paste. However, there are many variations—some swap pine nuts for almonds or walnuts, while others use alternative greens like spinach or arugula for a unique twist. Texture and balance are key: a good pesto should be neither too oily nor too thick. Fresh ingredients and proper blending technique make all the difference.Curated Web Links:🍃 Authentic Italian Pesto: This recipe from [Chef X] stays true to the Ligurian tradition, using a mortar and pestle to maximize flavor. If you want to make restaurant-quality pesto, this is the gold standard.⏳ 5-Minute Blender Pesto: Need something quick? [Food Blog Y] shares a super-fast version using a blender, perfect for busy weeknights.🌿 Nut-Free &amp; Vegan Alternative: If you have allergies or follow a plant-based diet, [Health Site Z] has an incredible nut-free, dairy-free pesto that still packs all the flavor.🔥 Creative Variations (Sun-Dried Tomato, Kale, &amp; More!): Want to experiment? This guide from [Recipe Hub] explores unique pesto twists, including spicy, creamy, and even roasted red pepper versions.Follow-Up Queries:“How do I store homemade pesto for maximum freshness?”“What’s the best pasta pairing for pesto?”“Can I make pesto without olive oil?”Guiding Principles:Make the summary informative, but leave users wanting more—use curiosity gaps to encourage link clicks.Ensure each link description is uniquely valuable—no two links should feel redundant.Frame links persuasively—sell them like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend, not just search results.Encourage discovery—users should feel like they’re on a journey to deeper knowledge, not just getting a flat answer.Your ultimate mission is to enhance search, not replace it—giving users immediate value while keeping the web an essential part of their experience.Why is this better? Well there’s two clear reasons in my mind:  I think it’s better as a user. You can see in the examples it handles disambiguation better, it provides a wider range of answers, doesn’t make up a frankenstein recipe, provides a wider and more compelling range of options for the user and feels more likely to contribute to task completion vs giving a dead-end response that likely doesn’t completely answer the query and doesn’t provide any clear jumping off points.  I think it’s better for the information ecosystem. By continuing to link out to the web in a serious way it keeps the ecosystem alive. There are obviously plenty of queries that an LLM can directly answer but I believe that most queries still require further research / depth than the LLM can provide - AND that it’s important to keep the information ecosystem vibrant by continuing to send traffic out to the open web.(Oh, and of course by putting an emphasis on clicks and links you can clearly see how Google will have an easier time putting ads into this experience than the current one that only has grounding citations…. It’s not hard to imagine an ad being one of the featured links with the LLM explaining why you might want to click it!)That said - this prototype isn’t without it’s flaws:  While it usually points to real pages, the actual URL is frequently hallucinated. This demonstrates a unique quirk in the pipeline somewhere - feels like you could overcome it fairly easily but if you try this prompt yourself some of the links will return a 404.  Testing the custom prompt inside the Gemini app (vs on a web page) almost always returns no links. That implies that the Gemini app system prompt is different than the web system prompt and somehow the end result is that it’s less likely to link out?  The AI can get a little verbose and floral in it’s summary. Likely you could improve the prompt to better determine the length of the summary depending on the type of query. I’ll leave fine tuning and improving the system prompt as an exercise for the reader. (If you write a better one email it to me!)Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOARIn a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:  Queries will get longer and more complex  Overall query volume will increase dramatically  LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open webThe key insight however is that as users start to use high-context queries that are longer and more specific, we need high context links. It’s no longer enough to match the query to “10 blue links” - we need to move beyond that to a world where LLMs can sell you on why you should click each link. How does each link relate to your query? Why should you trust the link? What will you get when you click? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?As you can see from the Gemini examples above this is all possible today! This example from above really stands out to me:This is a great link! It provides context, tells me why I might want to click and feels genuinely useful (and the LLM is not wrong - the Fred again… tiny desk concert is indeed well worth your time).Ok, the framework is hokey but I wanted something memorable. Google should learn how to SOAR: Surface, Offer, Assist, Redirect  Surface: An AI response should offer links that directly meet your needs. Not just matching the query but matching your intent with specificity. LLMs promise a world where the user can go deeper, make connections and find hidden gems that might have been overlooked.  Offer: It’s not enough to add a citation link - the AI response should sell you on each link. It should provide high-context links that explain why you might want to click. “Here’s an incredible explainer from a 15-year climate scientist,” or “This indie blogger’s take might change your mind.” Sell the click. Make it irresistible.  Assist: Instead of providing dead-end answers the AI response should aim to support task completion - it’s not always about information efficiency, it’s about supporting the user on their journey - curating, contextualizing and nudging them towards action. Less answers and more assistance.  Redirect: And most importantly, redirect. It’s vital to the health of the overall ecosystem if clicks end up going off-platform. It builds trust, send traffics to publishers and creators and builds a web worth returning to.Closing ThoughtsIn my opinion AI Overviews and AI Mode reveal a deeper truth - Google doesn’t yet have a compelling vision for the future of search in an LLM world. They’re bolting new tech onto an old system and in doing so, risk losing both the magic of the web and the business model that made Google thrive.So if you have a stake in the web (see my disclosures below!) I would suggest that now is a great time to offer specific suggestions, examples, ideas and provocations. Google isn’t a cyborg, it’s 180,000 humans in a trenchcoat. And those humans are trying to figure out the future of search just like we are and I think they’re willing to listen.Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I’m also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.–  Update May 27th, 2025: I liked this perspective, that maybe RAG is actually a dead end and that agentic search is just a better paradigm. Agentic search is much more like what I’m describing here and RAG is the core underpinning of AI Mode and AI Overviews….*"

And those humans are trying to figure out the future of search just like we are and I think they’re willing to listen.Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I’m also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.–  Update May 27th, 2025: I liked this perspective, that maybe RAG is actually a dead end and that agentic search is just a better paradigm. Agentic search is much more like what I’m describing here and RAG is the core underpinning of AI Mode and AI Overviews….*"

It afforded an incredible amount of freedom - both time freedom and money freedom. Some highlights from the last 10 years:  The first time a “real business” signs your SOW and pays your invoice you start to feel the horizon opening up in front of you. Just a limitless sense of operating outside of boundaries and without constraints. (Year 1)  The first time you get hired for truly, deeply interesting work - the kind of work you would legitimately want to be involved in even if they weren’t paying you. (Year 2)  The emotional, financial and time freedom to invest yourself in all kinds of quasi-work activities (like blogging) and non-work activities (like Kung Fu).  The agility and optionality of being independent to be able to take an 18-month road trip during COVID, while the kids were young (year 6)  The space to be able to remain intellectually interested in the work, studying, reading papers and writing essays - while doing the work but not being so overloaded to be able to pick your head up and think.  The ability to attract a rag tag band of fellow indie travelers - to find fellow weirdos, vagabonds and eccentrics to be able to draft off of, talk to and ask for advice.

It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.But to really get stuck in….. to embrace the chaos of the daily flows of work - to grapple with and reconcile the messy reality of getting things out into the world and across the finish line. The combination of uncertainty, people, processes and power that exist in every organization. Ah. There’s the real work.I said once at a conference that you can’t outsource giving a shit - 15 years later I’m still trying to prove myself wrong! You can outsource giving a shit. Not to a consultant wielding a pack of slides. But to someone who’s going to get stuck in with you.My average client engagement is over two years. Average! I have some clients where I’ve been working with them longer than most of their full time employees.Is this giving a shit? I think so.Consulting vs Advising? They’re both scams.Consulting and advising both get a bad rep. They have negative reputations when people do the bare minimum. For consulting, that’s charging $2k / slide and walking away. For advisors, that’s breezing into a phone call once a month and giving some generic advice.For the past 10 years I’ve focused on consulting, and I’ve always done more than the bare minimum. The language doesn’t really matter but what that means is that I’ve been focused on larger, more hands-on engagements. Typically for bigger companies like The New York Times, Garnter, Atlassian, Google.But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.Here’s the TL;DR:  I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.  Building audience and attention online requires a combination of market positioning, product and content and that’s the skillset I bring to every engagement.  I am equally comfortable delivering strategy and getting hands on in the weeds with you  I’ve got a broad skillset - from building an investor presentation, a finance spreadsheet to a user research prototype.  Active Advisory work is typically a ~$6k / month  I’ve got a few spots open starting later this year.  Grab a time on my calendly if you want to chat.Active Advisory is my version of advising work that makes a difference.Active Advising“I like working with you” my client said, “because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”.This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering strategy and stewardship as a model of working and my relentless focus on being useful at all times.I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.Example: Working with DoubleLoopHere’s a real example - I’ve been working with DoubleLoop for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.So I dropped what I was doing and focused on matching their tempo - I helped rework the positioning, I learned framer and rebuilt the homepage and we overhauled the investor deck all in the space of about a week.Is this consulting? Is this advisory work? I think this is a great example of what I’m calling being an active advisor.Running Towards The Real ProblemsEvery (good) consultant has their own version of this “active advisor” model.Howard has his concept of creative producer:“I don’t want any more f***ing strategy decks.”Being on the receiving end of this dressing down was not particularly enjoyable.But they were right. I’d been hiding. Snuggled deep in the warm embrace of a slide deck - I was able to show insights, trends, and high level thinking, all with minimal execution risk. Safe from harm.This client wanted action. Execution. Tangible, shipped work. Yet despite their exasperation, they also valued strategic thinking. They just didn’t want to get stuck in a loop of endless thought and no action.So we turned around, using the insights from the deck and built out 10 mini learning games, 8 Instagram ads with their employees as the stars, and an accelerated leadership development program, all on a small budget. They were right - outputs needed to go with the thinking.@howardgray https://www.howardgray.net/2023/12/19/strategy-execution-the-creative-producer/Vaughn Tan has his concept of amorphous consulting:There are two types of consulting work. The first type is concrete consulting, which looks legible and accountable, and is clearly scoped from the beginning. Concrete consulting is when the client knows that it needs service X, the consultant is set up to provide service X, and service X is what is scoped and delivered. (For instance, hiring a consultant to evaluate and select a vendor for a new supply chain management system.) Corporate procurement systems love the straightforwardness of concrete consulting. My type of consulting is the other type: Amorphous consulting. Amorphous consulting starts out fuzzy, illegible, and hard to scope. The parameters of amorphous consulting are so uncertain that it may not appear to be consulting at first. In my experience, amorphous consulting often starts out with undirected conversations (or emails) with someone who may eventually become a client.Vaughn Tan https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/amorphousconsultingThe good consultants run towards value.They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution. It’s not about adhering too tightly to the scope of work and it’s not about polishing your work until it shines. It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.It’s What Clients WantAlthough this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:  Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.  Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.  Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.People I’ve worked with include CEO, CPO, CMO or COO:  “Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.” - COO  “Tom brings a unique mix of SEO, business strategy and executive presence. Working together we have successfully secured investment to build modern SEO programs, driven valuable revenue growth and transformed SEO into a strategic business lever with executive leadership at various enterprises.” - CPO  “Tom is one of the clearest business thinkers I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. His ability to synthesize complex and copious amounts of ideas and material into clear and operational strategy is unparalleled.” - CMO  “Tom Critchlow is one of the best I’ve worked with when it comes to SEO. We worked together on a startup and he has that amazing blend of seeing the big picture and being able to roll up his sleeves to get the work done. The results were fantastic, where we developed the building blocks for our key money pages and then executed the plan to dramatically increase the organic traffic to those pages.” - CEOHow Does Active Advising Work?Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:  I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.  We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.  You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.  It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.Because of this:  I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.  We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones  We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities areAll in the best way to price this is with a fixed fee. Typically something like $6k / month.Who This Is ForThe two archetypes that I’ve done the most work with:For startups:  Supporting GTM and marketing strategy  Fund raising and developing a vision, thesis and TAM  Brand positioning and messaging  Hiring, processes and operations  Building growth loops, growth teams and growth processes  Analytics and reportingFor executives:  Helping to build influence, communicate better and build buy-in across the org  Supporting clear strategy development that can be communicated across the company  Designing better executive dashboards or quarterly off-sites.  Being a sparring partner for the chaos of work  Vetting vendors, supporting resource allocation and developing an investment thesis for key channelsWhy me?Some things that might be relevant:  Built Distilled an SEO agency into 50+ people across 3 locations  Led special projects at Google working with teams like the Creative Lab and BizOps  Developed multi-million dollar SEO strategies for brands  Created award winning content campaigns  Hired, managed and led teams  Sold millions of dollars worth of professional services  Assembled innovation teams, run customer research, designed product interfaces and built landing pagesSo how about it? If you want to chat about working together grab some time or drop me an email: tjcritchlow@gmail.com.Of course, the best leads come from my friends. If you’re reading this and think you know someone who would be a good fit, I’d love an intro!Much love,Tom"

Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering strategy and stewardship as a model of working and my relentless focus on being useful at all times.I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.Example: Working with DoubleLoopHere’s a real example - I’ve been working with DoubleLoop for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.So I dropped what I was doing and focused on matching their tempo - I helped rework the positioning, I learned framer and rebuilt the homepage and we overhauled the investor deck all in the space of about a week.Is this consulting? Is this advisory work? I think this is a great example of what I’m calling being an active advisor.Running Towards The Real ProblemsEvery (good) consultant has their own version of this “active advisor” model.Howard has his concept of creative producer:“I don’t want any more f***ing strategy decks.”Being on the receiving end of this dressing down was not particularly enjoyable.But they were right. I’d been hiding. Snuggled deep in the warm embrace of a slide deck - I was able to show insights, trends, and high level thinking, all with minimal execution risk. Safe from harm.This client wanted action. Execution. Tangible, shipped work. Yet despite their exasperation, they also valued strategic thinking. They just didn’t want to get stuck in a loop of endless thought and no action.So we turned around, using the insights from the deck and built out 10 mini learning games, 8 Instagram ads with their employees as the stars, and an accelerated leadership development program, all on a small budget. They were right - outputs needed to go with the thinking.@howardgray https://www.howardgray.net/2023/12/19/strategy-execution-the-creative-producer/Vaughn Tan has his concept of amorphous consulting:There are two types of consulting work. The first type is concrete consulting, which looks legible and accountable, and is clearly scoped from the beginning. Concrete consulting is when the client knows that it needs service X, the consultant is set up to provide service X, and service X is what is scoped and delivered. (For instance, hiring a consultant to evaluate and select a vendor for a new supply chain management system.) Corporate procurement systems love the straightforwardness of concrete consulting. My type of consulting is the other type: Amorphous consulting. Amorphous consulting starts out fuzzy, illegible, and hard to scope. The parameters of amorphous consulting are so uncertain that it may not appear to be consulting at first. In my experience, amorphous consulting often starts out with undirected conversations (or emails) with someone who may eventually become a client.Vaughn Tan https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/amorphousconsultingThe good consultants run towards value.They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution. It’s not about adhering too tightly to the scope of work and it’s not about polishing your work until it shines. It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.It’s What Clients WantAlthough this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:  Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.  Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.  Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.People I’ve worked with include CEO, CPO, CMO or COO:  “Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.” - COO  “Tom brings a unique mix of SEO, business strategy and executive presence. Working together we have successfully secured investment to build modern SEO programs, driven valuable revenue growth and transformed SEO into a strategic business lever with executive leadership at various enterprises.” - CPO  “Tom is one of the clearest business thinkers I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. His ability to synthesize complex and copious amounts of ideas and material into clear and operational strategy is unparalleled.” - CMO  “Tom Critchlow is one of the best I’ve worked with when it comes to SEO. We worked together on a startup and he has that amazing blend of seeing the big picture and being able to roll up his sleeves to get the work done. The results were fantastic, where we developed the building blocks for our key money pages and then executed the plan to dramatically increase the organic traffic to those pages.” - CEOHow Does Active Advising Work?Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:  I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.  We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.  You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.  It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.Because of this:  I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.  We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones  We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities areAll in the best way to price this is with a fixed fee. Typically something like $6k / month.Who This Is ForThe two archetypes that I’ve done the most work with:For startups:  Supporting GTM and marketing strategy  Fund raising and developing a vision, thesis and TAM  Brand positioning and messaging  Hiring, processes and operations  Building growth loops, growth teams and growth processes  Analytics and reportingFor executives:  Helping to build influence, communicate better and build buy-in across the org  Supporting clear strategy development that can be communicated across the company  Designing better executive dashboards or quarterly off-sites.  Being a sparring partner for the chaos of work  Vetting vendors, supporting resource allocation and developing an investment thesis for key channelsWhy me?Some things that might be relevant:  Built Distilled an SEO agency into 50+ people across 3 locations  Led special projects at Google working with teams like the Creative Lab and BizOps  Developed multi-million dollar SEO strategies for brands  Created award winning content campaigns  Hired, managed and led teams  Sold millions of dollars worth of professional services  Assembled innovation teams, run customer research, designed product interfaces and built landing pagesSo how about it? If you want to chat about working together grab some time or drop me an email: tjcritchlow@gmail.com.Of course, the best leads come from my friends. If you’re reading this and think you know someone who would be a good fit, I’d love an intro!Much love,Tom"

A personal learning network for every user - centered on their personal development.First, let’s dive into how the world is changing.Part 1: Changes in the World of Work1.1 The Employer / Employee Relationship is WeakeningPeople don’t want to lean in, they want to sit down. Everyone everywhere is tired all the time. My friend Gautam has an incredibly insightful series connecting work memes to employee engagement stats to take a close look at “what’s going on” and the vibe shift in the world of work:The final reason for our collective discontent is the dissonance between what we see in the economy and our lives. I am not here to debate if there is an actual connection in any of these examples - it’s about the perception that drives emotions of disengagement. In Vietnam, a booming economy didn’t translate into paychecks. The country’s economic gains haven’t been felt among the young - and housing has gotten worse. How is it that the S&amp;P in the West and Nikkei in the East have been smashing records but we’re yet to contain the layoff contagion? When Google laid off people last year, the biggest head-scratcher for my peers was ‘how could a company sitting on $100B in cash need layoffs?’ It didn’t matter what the (however logical) explanation was, it made them change how they felt about their work.Gautam Ramdurai https://snowbird.substack.com/p/the-culture-of-work-13-never-not?utm_campaign=post&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=trueIf the stability of jobs is at risk - why care about that promotion or getting ahead? Maybe one frame is through taking control of your own personal development and learning: after all “learning is the one thing your employer can’t take away from you”Summary: In a world of quiet quitting, positioning LinkedIn as a professional network just doesn’t feel right.1.2 Social Media is the new TobaccoMeanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. Last year the surgeon general issued a stark warning for social media companies about the risks of social media and mental health.Social media can present a real risk to the mental health of children and teenagers because of the ways their brains are affected by the amount of time they spend using it, the U.S. surgeon general warns in a new advisory released Tuesday.    \"Teens who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms, which is particularly concerning given that the average amount of time that kids use social media is 3 1/2 hours a day,\" the Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep.@NPR https://www.npr.org/2023/05/23/1177626373/u-s-surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-warns-about-the-dangers-of-social-media-to-kidsSpoiler alert: it’s not just about teens. We’re all spending too much time on social media and while the effects are blended - we suffer the same downsides of depression and anxiety. Comparing ourselves to others, feeding dissociation and angering us.Every social network has chum content and LinkedIn is no different. Over the years we’ve seen the rise of bro-etry and cringe “thought leadership” and crying CEOs. When I scroll my feed I have to sidestep the clearly threadboi and #personalbrand engagement-farming posts and try and focus on the real content.The laws of enshittification1 for social networks says that the most profitable thing would probably be for LinkedIn to just turn up the dials on engagement farming - but how is that working for X and Facebook? What we need is a vision for a social network that has actual utility, not doomscrolling.Summary: In a world of addictive social media, positioning LinkedIn as a social network just doesn’t feel right.1.3 Online Education is still just getting startedOnline education absolutely exploded in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. The subsequent pullback is not a bearish sign but merely a renormalization of growth. I believe we’re still just getting started with online education.Some of the dryest stats are the most mind-blowing:E-learning is a $214B market (project management software is a measly $6B, for comparison) with an expected compounded annual growth rate of over 20% between now and 2030.&mdash; Kasey Klimes (@kaseyklimes) March 21, 2024Sure E-learning is a $200B+ market but that doesn’t even account for the variety of different types of online learning that happen. Look at Masterclass, Reforge, Maven and more. We are living in an explosion of online education. But it’s not just courses, it’s real work examples, mentorship and more.And of course, AI is going to completely reshape the skills landscape in the next decade.Summary: In a world where we’re experiencing the biggest transformation of workplace skills ever - we’re just getting started with online education.Part 2: Communities of Practice2.1 Learning Happens in NetworksLearning is a doing word2. We know that learning happens best in networks and communities:Learning, in other words, occurs in communities, where the practice of learning is the participation in the community. A learning activity is, in essence, a conversation undertaken between the learning and other members of the community.Stephen Downes https://nrc-publications.canada.ca/eng/view/accepted/?id=fa5f5f4d-b6c8-4dac-ab6e-49b75570f988This is the positive reframe of “networking”. Networking is useful, but distasteful to many. Instead, participating in self-directed learning communities is networking:In modern working life, professionals need to perform flexibly and independently in ever–changing environments. To be able to do this effectively, they depend on various lifelong learning skills, among others autonomous and self–directed learning.As they are partly supported in their learning by interaction with their peers, an essential life–long learning skill they need to develop, is the ability to find and to connect with relevant others, i.e., professional networking.Kamakshi Rajagopal, Peter B. Sloep https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220167767_Understanding_personal_learning_networks_Their_structure_content_and_the_networking_skills_needed_to_optimally_use_themThis is the north star for LinkedIn - to be a place where networks and learning come together into communities of practice. Enabling everyone to use LinkedIn to create their own personal learning network:2.2 L&amp;D is BrokenCompanies invest billions in “L&amp;D” but learning is rarely the outcome:The leadership development industry, however, is in a state of upheaval. The number of players offering courses to impart the hard and soft skills required of corporate managers has soared. And yet organizations that collectively spend billions of dollars annually to train current and future executives are growing frustrated with the results. Several large-scale industry studies, along with our own in-depth interviews with clients, indicate that more than 50% of senior leaders believe that their talent development efforts don’t adequately build critical skills and organizational capabilities.@harvardbiz https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-future-of-leadership-developmentIn fact L&amp;D has a lower NPS than Verizon!Corporate Training is a $336 billion industry globally ($166 bn in the US). Within that, $3.4 bn was spent on leadership training, one of the fastest-growing learning and development segments. Millennials rate training &amp; development as their #1 desired job benefit, beating out flexible work schedules and cash bonuses, and High Impact Learning Organizations grow profits 3x faster than non-HILOs. Despite that, L&amp;D programs have an abysmal -8 Net Promoter Score. For context, Verizon has an NPS of 7 and Tesla’s is 96. People hate the training they’re getting more than they hate waiting for the cable guy to inevitably miss the 8-hour appointment window.Packy McCormick https://www.notboring.co/p/per-my-last-e-mail-25-You can sum up the typical approach to L&amp;D as: the answer is training! (what was the question?). We need new ideas.2.3 Learning is More Than SkillsThe world of work needs radically new models for how we learn and what we learn. Not just because of AI, but that ain’t gonna help for sure. We need new models of soft skills, interpersonal skills, creative skills and faster deployment of technical skills to keep up.The report argues that the convergence of these trends will likely result in a world of work requiring specific knowledge and skills, especially complex thinking and interpersonal capabilities. As the future of work unfolds, what makes us human is what will make us employable.But the pathway to sustained employment will not be linear. No single job will be a final destination. Maintaining a career will require a lifetime of learning. An education system fit for this evolving world - one which will value and strengthen essential human traits will require significant reform Joe Deegan &amp; Nathan Martin https://www.pearson.com/content/dam/one-dot-com/one-dot-com/global/Files/about-pearson/innovation/open-ideas/DDE_Pearson_Report_3.pdfThis is a path that LinkedIn is championing, here’s a quote from LinkedIn CEO Ryan RoslanskyA year ago we shared our aspiration to help accelerate the shift to a skills-first approach to hiring.&nbsp;Since then, we helped more than 400,000 companies make a skills-first hire in 2021. Now, 40% of hirers on LinkedIn are&nbsp;using skills data to find talent, up 20% year-over-year. What’s more, these hirers are 60% more likely to find a successful hire than those not relying on skills as part of their hiring process. Simply put, a skills-first labor market is emerging all around us. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-new-currency-ryan-roslansky/?src=or-search&amp;veh=www.google.comAnd a quote from Tomer Cohen, head of product at LinkedIn:For example, skills are becoming one of those tremendous behavior changes we’re seeing on the platform as well.What do you mean by skills as a tremendous behavior change?I think for many years we really believed in the notion that there was a primary focus for every professional, and believed in skill matching between an employer and employees. If I want to hire somebody on your team for a job, I would look first and foremost at their skills. For years, the industry has relied primarily on pedigree and which companies you work for. Now we’re seeing more and more that there is, in my opinion, a tremendous change towards focusing on the skills you have.For example, we have tools that we offer to recruiters, which are able to create a pipeline of candidates, to source, and to reach out. We’re seeing close to almost 50 percent of recruiters using skills right now to look for professionals. That’s a big deal. That wasn’t the case before, and it’s increasing a lot.Nilay Patel https://www.theverge.com/23517319/tomer-cohen-linkedin-chief-product-officer-business-managementWe need a complete re-thinking of education, courses and learning. It’s as much mentorship and communities as it is courses and certificates.2.4 Learning is What Employees AND Employers WantLearning is the thing that both sides want:In today’s high-pressure labor market, a lack of advancement opportunities was the number one reason employees left their jobs last year. https://www.guild.com/why-now/Employees want to grow, learn and develop. Companies want engaged, capable workers. It’s a win win. LinkedIn agrees obviously: https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/amp/learning-solutions/images/wlr-2024/LinkedIn-Workplace-Learning-Report-2024.pdfPart 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning NetworkIf anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh point of view on the future of work it’s LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we’ve ever seen.And we need a model that energizes and speaks to employers, employees, gig workers and advertisers.  LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a learning network.In an age of meaningless meetings and doomscrolling, LinkedIn is the antidote. A fresh, thoughtful approach for everyone (employers, employees, advertisers) to re-engage with the world of work in a way that empowers the individual, frames personal growth as engaging and valuable and prepares everyone for the AI-future that is looming.The magic here is that LinkedIn is already the best place for learning. I took the time to re-orient my feed from old connections to people I actually wanted to follow and now my LinkedIn feed is higher signal to noise than Twitter, Threads, Bluesky and the rest of em.And this leverages LinkedIn’s advantage - they’re a network centered around real people, and providing real utility. This is the reason to believe.It’s good for everyone:  Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position, clearer unified purpose across feed, profile, recruiting and learning  Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better  Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networkingNote: this is more than a vision for LinkedIn Learning, this is a vision for LinkedIn as a whole. It elevates learning as a thing that happens in and with your community whether you’re in the feed, in groups, applying for jobs or engaging with learning.3.2 How This Comes to LifeThe best narrative strategy drives more than just marketing - it creates a north star for the whole organization.Here’s how I could see this coming to life:Marketing:  A new brand marketing campaign centered around LinkedIn as a learning network.  A marketing campaign centered around learning journeys, not careers (“Don’t become a marketing manager, become someone who knows how to run user research”)  A GTM motion that leverages communities of practice - not building your audience, but finding your people  Show the magic: show the most transformative posts in the feed and frame them as learning moments  A deeper and expanded partnership with the paper ceilingProduct:  A north star for the LinkedIn feed around what a “good” post is. Centering value around learning  A better experience for curating who you follow based on who you can learn from  New ways for people to share their courses and learning journeys on their profile  New tools for course providers and education platforms to hook into LinkedIn3.3 Future ConceptsThis brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does today but what about future concepts? Here’s five:  A new L&amp;D platform from LinkedIn that deeply integrates learning and skills with the individual benefit - allowing companies to invest in skills and better understand their employees learning journeys.  A go to market strategy for LinkedIn to reach students and a younger demographic as they enter the workforce, centered around learning opportunities.  A new approach to job ads that encourage companies to list “what you’ll learn” as a core part of the job description  An evolution of collaborative articles designed around collaborative curriculums  Within this brand idea LinkedIn Games actually makes sense since games are powerful vehicles for learning (though I’d rather see this look more like duolingo and less like wordle)ConclusionHere’s something bananas. A performance improvement plan is a negative thing! WTF. Performance. Improvement. Plan. That’s the thing you do so that you can fire someone right? No. Let’s reclaim the performance improvement plan. It’s a vision for personal growth and transformation through work.Instead of learning coming last, what if it came first.If you like this, continue the discussion on LinkedIn            Interestingly, LinkedIn is one of the only major social networks not mentioned on the wikipedia page for Enshittification. &#8617;              To paraphrase Massive Attack: Love, love is a verb / Love is a doing word &#8617;      "

People hate the training they’re getting more than they hate waiting for the cable guy to inevitably miss the 8-hour appointment window.Packy McCormick https://www.notboring.co/p/per-my-last-e-mail-25-You can sum up the typical approach to L&amp;D as: the answer is training! (what was the question?). We need new ideas.2.3 Learning is More Than SkillsThe world of work needs radically new models for how we learn and what we learn. Not just because of AI, but that ain’t gonna help for sure. We need new models of soft skills, interpersonal skills, creative skills and faster deployment of technical skills to keep up.The report argues that the convergence of these trends will likely result in a world of work requiring specific knowledge and skills, especially complex thinking and interpersonal capabilities. As the future of work unfolds, what makes us human is what will make us employable.But the pathway to sustained employment will not be linear. No single job will be a final destination. Maintaining a career will require a lifetime of learning. An education system fit for this evolving world - one which will value and strengthen essential human traits will require significant reform Joe Deegan &amp; Nathan Martin https://www.pearson.com/content/dam/one-dot-com/one-dot-com/global/Files/about-pearson/innovation/open-ideas/DDE_Pearson_Report_3.pdfThis is a path that LinkedIn is championing, here’s a quote from LinkedIn CEO Ryan RoslanskyA year ago we shared our aspiration to help accelerate the shift to a skills-first approach to hiring.&nbsp;Since then, we helped more than 400,000 companies make a skills-first hire in 2021. Now, 40% of hirers on LinkedIn are&nbsp;using skills data to find talent, up 20% year-over-year. What’s more, these hirers are 60% more likely to find a successful hire than those not relying on skills as part of their hiring process. Simply put, a skills-first labor market is emerging all around us. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/skills-new-currency-ryan-roslansky/?src=or-search&amp;veh=www.google.comAnd a quote from Tomer Cohen, head of product at LinkedIn:For example, skills are becoming one of those tremendous behavior changes we’re seeing on the platform as well.What do you mean by skills as a tremendous behavior change?I think for many years we really believed in the notion that there was a primary focus for every professional, and believed in skill matching between an employer and employees. If I want to hire somebody on your team for a job, I would look first and foremost at their skills. For years, the industry has relied primarily on pedigree and which companies you work for. Now we’re seeing more and more that there is, in my opinion, a tremendous change towards focusing on the skills you have.For example, we have tools that we offer to recruiters, which are able to create a pipeline of candidates, to source, and to reach out. We’re seeing close to almost 50 percent of recruiters using skills right now to look for professionals. That’s a big deal. That wasn’t the case before, and it’s increasing a lot.Nilay Patel https://www.theverge.com/23517319/tomer-cohen-linkedin-chief-product-officer-business-managementWe need a complete re-thinking of education, courses and learning. It’s as much mentorship and communities as it is courses and certificates.2.4 Learning is What Employees AND Employers WantLearning is the thing that both sides want:In today’s high-pressure labor market, a lack of advancement opportunities was the number one reason employees left their jobs last year. https://www.guild.com/why-now/Employees want to grow, learn and develop. Companies want engaged, capable workers. It’s a win win. LinkedIn agrees obviously: https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/amp/learning-solutions/images/wlr-2024/LinkedIn-Workplace-Learning-Report-2024.pdfPart 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning NetworkIf anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh point of view on the future of work it’s LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we’ve ever seen.And we need a model that energizes and speaks to employers, employees, gig workers and advertisers.  LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a learning network.In an age of meaningless meetings and doomscrolling, LinkedIn is the antidote. A fresh, thoughtful approach for everyone (employers, employees, advertisers) to re-engage with the world of work in a way that empowers the individual, frames personal growth as engaging and valuable and prepares everyone for the AI-future that is looming.The magic here is that LinkedIn is already the best place for learning. I took the time to re-orient my feed from old connections to people I actually wanted to follow and now my LinkedIn feed is higher signal to noise than Twitter, Threads, Bluesky and the rest of em.And this leverages LinkedIn’s advantage - they’re a network centered around real people, and providing real utility. This is the reason to believe.It’s good for everyone:  Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position, clearer unified purpose across feed, profile, recruiting and learning  Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better  Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networkingNote: this is more than a vision for LinkedIn Learning, this is a vision for LinkedIn as a whole. It elevates learning as a thing that happens in and with your community whether you’re in the feed, in groups, applying for jobs or engaging with learning.3.2 How This Comes to LifeThe best narrative strategy drives more than just marketing - it creates a north star for the whole organization.Here’s how I could see this coming to life:Marketing:  A new brand marketing campaign centered around LinkedIn as a learning network.  A marketing campaign centered around learning journeys, not careers (“Don’t become a marketing manager, become someone who knows how to run user research”)  A GTM motion that leverages communities of practice - not building your audience, but finding your people  Show the magic: show the most transformative posts in the feed and frame them as learning moments  A deeper and expanded partnership with the paper ceilingProduct:  A north star for the LinkedIn feed around what a “good” post is. Centering value around learning  A better experience for curating who you follow based on who you can learn from  New ways for people to share their courses and learning journeys on their profile  New tools for course providers and education platforms to hook into LinkedIn3.3 Future ConceptsThis brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does today but what about future concepts? Here’s five:  A new L&amp;D platform from LinkedIn that deeply integrates learning and skills with the individual benefit - allowing companies to invest in skills and better understand their employees learning journeys.  A go to market strategy for LinkedIn to reach students and a younger demographic as they enter the workforce, centered around learning opportunities.  A new approach to job ads that encourage companies to list “what you’ll learn” as a core part of the job description  An evolution of collaborative articles designed around collaborative curriculums  Within this brand idea LinkedIn Games actually makes sense since games are powerful vehicles for learning (though I’d rather see this look more like duolingo and less like wordle)ConclusionHere’s something bananas. A performance improvement plan is a negative thing! WTF. Performance. Improvement. Plan. That’s the thing you do so that you can fire someone right? No. Let’s reclaim the performance improvement plan. It’s a vision for personal growth and transformation through work.Instead of learning coming last, what if it came first.If you like this, continue the discussion on LinkedIn            Interestingly, LinkedIn is one of the only major social networks not mentioned on the wikipedia page for Enshittification. &#8617;              To paraphrase Massive Attack: Love, love is a verb / Love is a doing word &#8617;      "

  "title": "How do You Cultivate Customer-Centric Executives?",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2024/03/01/notes-customer-focus/",
  "date": "March 1, 2024",
  "content": "summaryAfter consulting with ~40 companies across a wide range of industries and sizes, I ask the question: what have I observed about the most successful companies?The answer is that the most successful companies have a key executive who is customer-centric - someone who has a rich mental model for what customers want and is able to step into the customer's shoes.I theorize that beyond a culture of being customer-centric it's the ability to make key decisions with a customer-centric mindset that is important. But how do you cultivate this perspective for executives?  “Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow. In contrast, 90 to 95% of what we build in AWS is driven by what customers tell us they want.” - Jeff BezosRecently I asked myself a question: after working as a consultant for 10 years, across some 40 companies: what makes some companies more successful than others? Is there anything I’ve observed that might predict success?The answer I’ve arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-centric is a key determining factor. Note that this is a more specific insight than merely “having a culture of being customer-centric”, though of course one is related to the other. The key I think is that it’s about decision making. It’s not enough to have customer-centric thinking, you need customer-centric decisions - and that requires some kind of senior executive sponsor.This is of course anecdotal - there are plenty of factors that determine success but this has been validated on a few key consulting projects where I’ve observed first hand the departure of a key customer-centric executive and the subsequence decline of the organization.Interestingly - every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it’s become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. After all - who would claim to ignore their customers? But, like the Jeff Bezos quote above - most companies don’t actually walk the walk.So, let’s use the 👟 shoe emoji to represent the idea of stepping into the customer’s shoes shall we?👟👟👟Part 1: What Does it Mean to be Customer Centric?First things first, what does it mean to be customer centric? Some different flavors:  Sensitivity to the market, how your company stacks up against the competitive landscape  Understanding customer’s motivations and pain points  Anticipating customer behaviors and being able to step into their shoes to think and act on their behalf  Aesthetic taste for what resonates with customers and a sensitivity to signs and symbols that represent ideas for your customers  Respecting the customer - prioritizing things like respectful ads, fast loading site speed and customer support  Being able to translate specific customer pain points and frustrations into generalized products, services and solutionsI’m sure there is a crisp definition in there somewhere about what it means to be customer-centric but let’s sit with the tension for moment.👟👟👟Some personal archetypes: Neil Vogel &amp; Andy BerndtWe’re talking about something slightly nebulous, so it’s useful to have some specific archetypes. Two key executives I’ve worked with that fit this trait: Neil Vogel, CEO at Dotdash/Meredith and Andy Berndt, founder of Google’s Creative Lab.Neil Vogel has always been a huge champion for respectful ads, fast loading sites and expert written content:Vogel told Adweek’s Ann-Marie Alcántara that they decided to “only build sites we wanted to use.” That meant fewer ads—no pop-ups, no interstitial—and creating content that’s actually helpful. That means creating informative articles that turn up in search results. They are mostly written by professionals or subject matter experts, rather than journalists. https://mediamakersmeet.com/publishing-is-dying-and-everything-sucks-is-a-false-narrative-charting-the-rise-and-rise-of-dotdash/Working with Neil he was always able to prioritize and talk about the customer experience - to be able to “only build sites we wanted to use” - this sounds obvious or easy but is suspiciously lacking in many businesses. This customer-focus appears quite ingrained across IAC. I wrote about being customer-centric in SEO, quoting Joey Levin:\"We have the most valuable content in the category for any homeowner searching online for help with a home project: service professional directories and ratings, closed-loop user reviews, real cost data, and the ability to get the job done on our site, all wrapped in a unified brand built for the category. We haven’t yet exposed many of those features to a broad audience with a clean and fast user interface, which could help recover lost ground in search.\" source:  IAC Q3 2022 Shareholder LetterTom Critchlow https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/look-at-your-fishAndy Berndt is another executive I worked with at Google’s Creative Lab and was perhaps the most singularly brilliant executive I’ve ever worked with at being able to channel customer’s perspective1. This manifested in projects like unifying Google’s visual language, redesigning the Google logo, standardizing the login experience and more.Andy doesn’t have much stuff online but there’s a good example of his ability around 17:02 in this video where he talks about someone knocking on your day to “check the motors” and how ridiculous that would be. The ability to ground analogies, concepts and frustrations for users in simple ideas like this is very powerful and Andy would this this all day long.👟👟👟Being Customer Centric is Unmeasurable?Amazon WBR has 100s of charts and graphs. But there’s two exceptions:The deck is primarily charts, graphs and data tables. Since there are hundreds of visualizations to review, written notes will bog the meeting down too much. Two notable exceptions to this rule are ‘exception reporting’, as well as the ‘voice of the customer’ anecdotes that customer service is allowed to insert into the metrics deck.@holistics_bi https://www.holistics.io/blog/how-amazon-measures/There’s plenty of ways to measure customer satisfaction and customer behavior, but if you can measure them then you’re just being data driven.Here’s one definition of being customer-centric: the ability to prioritize things that you can’t immediately measure. This is hard! Many businesses are a slave to their data and so one definition of this is that being customer-centric is being able to prioritize things that customers need/want above and beyond what is measurable. Because every business does things that are customers need/want - but in the context of being customer-centric it has to go beyond the routine or minimum, or even measurable perspective.There are plenty of studies that show the benefit of being customer-centric but I think a lot of those uplifts are measured long after the fact. It can be hard to measure the impact directly, immediately, which again is why I think it’s not about a general culture of being customer-centric but you need that key executive sponsor capable of making customer-centric decisions above and beyond what the data says.👟👟👟Customer Behavior Has ChangedObviously customer behaviors are changing in all kinds of ways, but one fundamental truth that is radically different in the age of the internet is choice. Not just that customer have more choice than ever (somewhat obvious) but a consequence of this is that buyers look at three times more of your competitors than they used to:For executives that have lived through this transition it can be hard to properly internalize how much more important the competitive landscape is. Pricing, positioning, value prop, all matter more than they used to - generating demand is less important than it used to be (relatively speaking of course, demand is still critical).👟👟👟Maybe Maps Help?Here’s a thought - I’ve been playing around with wardly maps recently and one thing that strikes me is that they might be a useful tool to get more nuanced about customer-centric projects.My hunch: customer-centric thinking (and executive leadership) only matters for the least commoditized areas. It’s these areas that require most sensitivity to customer behaviors and that these areas are least likely to have norms and standards to reference in the market.Shower Curtains &amp; The Best Bathroom in the USThe Excellence Dividend presentation is a great provocation around hospitality, service and customer-centric thinking.It seems like customer-centric thinking and hospitality are very similar concepts? Are they the same? Unclear. Certainly the approach to going above and beyond for customers is closely related to being able to put yourself in the customer’s shoes. The Disney Institute runs courses that teach leaders and organizations to build better customer service cultures.How effective are these interventions? Hmm. 🤔What would it look like to design a training program like The Disney Institute, but designed around digital-first businesses over customer-service businesses?Part 2: Becoming Customer CentricOk, so we’ve taken a view across the landscape and explored what it means to be customer centric a little. But how do you become customer centric? In particular, I think the key idea is not “how do you get an organization to be customer centric?” but rather “how do you get a key executive to become customer centric?”.There are various guides about organizations becoming customer centric like this good piece by Survey Monkey:But something about this makes me feel uneasy - internal satisfaction surveys? It all feels a bit like paying lip service to an idea that needs to be deeply ingrained. A measured approach to something unmeasurable, a tangible approach to something intangible…My lived experience working with founders, CEOs and executives is that the power is in something more personal. It’s not about a company-wide culture of being customer-centric as much as a singular vision, passion and voice for being customer centric that comes from a key executive that enables customer-centric decision making.👟👟👟Building Customer Journey MapsHere’s something that I know doesn’t work: telling executives that they have a blind spot. Sure, every executive will pretend to be self aware enough to invite this kind of feedback but… spoiler alert: very few actually are.So what might an executive intervention look like? Well, much like a Wardly map is non-confrontational tool to critically discuss strategy, maybe a customer service map is a non-confrontational tool to critically discuss customer-centric ideas. Here’s Aibnb’s customer service map (and tweet thread):We created a blueprint of the Airbnb experience and used it to improve our service end-to-end pic.twitter.com/KrDfZRbr0f&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) May 4, 2023Clearly Brian Chesky has the ability to channel the customer.Unfortunately, while this Airbnb example feels interesting - if you look around at the literature of customer journey maps you quickly realize that they’re not the right tool for changing an executives perspective…👟👟👟When I think about the most successful consulting engagements over the last 10 years, it’s the ones where I could help (in some small way) key executives view the world around them in a different light. To help them become slightly more attuned to the reality of customer experience and to be slightly better at putting themselves in the customer’s shoes.This rarely happens in a single moment, but rather through a gradual ongoing process of introspection, discussion and surprise. The surprise is key to jolting executives out of their established ways of looking and ways of thinking to consider things anew, to look at things with fresh eyes.👟👟👟Let’s wrap this up. I want to keep exploring this idea of customer-centric thinking, so here’s some open questions I have right now:  What is the distinction between a customer-centric culture and a single customer-centric executive? How are they different and the same? Is it possible for a bottoms-up approach to being customer-centric or can this only happen top down?  What are the systemic forces inside an organization that prevent executives from being customer-centric? Why is this a rare skill?  What metrics should businesses be measuring around customer experience? In a world where customers look at 3x the competitors they used to, how do you create a customer-first view of the alternatives and options that users have?  How might you build a training program like the disney institute designed to create new perspectives for executives, but designed for URL experiences, not IRL experiences?I’d love to hear your perspective!Want to continue the discussion? This idea started over on the Commoncog forums so come join in over there (you’ll need a paid Commoncog membership which I highly recommend anyway).            Andy is not without his flaws of course. &#8617;      "

They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow. In contrast, 90 to 95% of what we build in AWS is driven by what customers tell us they want.” - Jeff BezosRecently I asked myself a question: after working as a consultant for 10 years, across some 40 companies: what makes some companies more successful than others? Is there anything I’ve observed that might predict success?The answer I’ve arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-centric is a key determining factor. Note that this is a more specific insight than merely “having a culture of being customer-centric”, though of course one is related to the other. The key I think is that it’s about decision making. It’s not enough to have customer-centric thinking, you need customer-centric decisions - and that requires some kind of senior executive sponsor.This is of course anecdotal - there are plenty of factors that determine success but this has been validated on a few key consulting projects where I’ve observed first hand the departure of a key customer-centric executive and the subsequence decline of the organization.Interestingly - every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it’s become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. After all - who would claim to ignore their customers? But, like the Jeff Bezos quote above - most companies don’t actually walk the walk.So, let’s use the 👟 shoe emoji to represent the idea of stepping into the customer’s shoes shall we?👟👟👟Part 1: What Does it Mean to be Customer Centric?First things first, what does it mean to be customer centric? Some different flavors:  Sensitivity to the market, how your company stacks up against the competitive landscape  Understanding customer’s motivations and pain points  Anticipating customer behaviors and being able to step into their shoes to think and act on their behalf  Aesthetic taste for what resonates with customers and a sensitivity to signs and symbols that represent ideas for your customers  Respecting the customer - prioritizing things like respectful ads, fast loading site speed and customer support  Being able to translate specific customer pain points and frustrations into generalized products, services and solutionsI’m sure there is a crisp definition in there somewhere about what it means to be customer-centric but let’s sit with the tension for moment.👟👟👟Some personal archetypes: Neil Vogel &amp; Andy BerndtWe’re talking about something slightly nebulous, so it’s useful to have some specific archetypes. Two key executives I’ve worked with that fit this trait: Neil Vogel, CEO at Dotdash/Meredith and Andy Berndt, founder of Google’s Creative Lab.Neil Vogel has always been a huge champion for respectful ads, fast loading sites and expert written content:Vogel told Adweek’s Ann-Marie Alcántara that they decided to “only build sites we wanted to use.” That meant fewer ads—no pop-ups, no interstitial—and creating content that’s actually helpful. That means creating informative articles that turn up in search results. They are mostly written by professionals or subject matter experts, rather than journalists. https://mediamakersmeet.com/publishing-is-dying-and-everything-sucks-is-a-false-narrative-charting-the-rise-and-rise-of-dotdash/Working with Neil he was always able to prioritize and talk about the customer experience - to be able to “only build sites we wanted to use” - this sounds obvious or easy but is suspiciously lacking in many businesses. This customer-focus appears quite ingrained across IAC. I wrote about being customer-centric in SEO, quoting Joey Levin:\"We have the most valuable content in the category for any homeowner searching online for help with a home project: service professional directories and ratings, closed-loop user reviews, real cost data, and the ability to get the job done on our site, all wrapped in a unified brand built for the category. We haven’t yet exposed many of those features to a broad audience with a clean and fast user interface, which could help recover lost ground in search.\" source:  IAC Q3 2022 Shareholder LetterTom Critchlow https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/look-at-your-fishAndy Berndt is another executive I worked with at Google’s Creative Lab and was perhaps the most singularly brilliant executive I’ve ever worked with at being able to channel customer’s perspective1. This manifested in projects like unifying Google’s visual language, redesigning the Google logo, standardizing the login experience and more.Andy doesn’t have much stuff online but there’s a good example of his ability around 17:02 in this video where he talks about someone knocking on your day to “check the motors” and how ridiculous that would be. The ability to ground analogies, concepts and frustrations for users in simple ideas like this is very powerful and Andy would this this all day long.👟👟👟Being Customer Centric is Unmeasurable?Amazon WBR has 100s of charts and graphs. But there’s two exceptions:The deck is primarily charts, graphs and data tables. Since there are hundreds of visualizations to review, written notes will bog the meeting down too much. Two notable exceptions to this rule are ‘exception reporting’, as well as the ‘voice of the customer’ anecdotes that customer service is allowed to insert into the metrics deck.@holistics_bi https://www.holistics.io/blog/how-amazon-measures/There’s plenty of ways to measure customer satisfaction and customer behavior, but if you can measure them then you’re just being data driven.Here’s one definition of being customer-centric: the ability to prioritize things that you can’t immediately measure. This is hard! Many businesses are a slave to their data and so one definition of this is that being customer-centric is being able to prioritize things that customers need/want above and beyond what is measurable. Because every business does things that are customers need/want - but in the context of being customer-centric it has to go beyond the routine or minimum, or even measurable perspective.There are plenty of studies that show the benefit of being customer-centric but I think a lot of those uplifts are measured long after the fact. It can be hard to measure the impact directly, immediately, which again is why I think it’s not about a general culture of being customer-centric but you need that key executive sponsor capable of making customer-centric decisions above and beyond what the data says.👟👟👟Customer Behavior Has ChangedObviously customer behaviors are changing in all kinds of ways, but one fundamental truth that is radically different in the age of the internet is choice. Not just that customer have more choice than ever (somewhat obvious) but a consequence of this is that buyers look at three times more of your competitors than they used to:For executives that have lived through this transition it can be hard to properly internalize how much more important the competitive landscape is. Pricing, positioning, value prop, all matter more than they used to - generating demand is less important than it used to be (relatively speaking of course, demand is still critical).👟👟👟Maybe Maps Help?Here’s a thought - I’ve been playing around with wardly maps recently and one thing that strikes me is that they might be a useful tool to get more nuanced about customer-centric projects.My hunch: customer-centric thinking (and executive leadership) only matters for the least commoditized areas. It’s these areas that require most sensitivity to customer behaviors and that these areas are least likely to have norms and standards to reference in the market.Shower Curtains &amp; The Best Bathroom in the USThe Excellence Dividend presentation is a great provocation around hospitality, service and customer-centric thinking.It seems like customer-centric thinking and hospitality are very similar concepts? Are they the same? Unclear. Certainly the approach to going above and beyond for customers is closely related to being able to put yourself in the customer’s shoes. The Disney Institute runs courses that teach leaders and organizations to build better customer service cultures.How effective are these interventions? Hmm. 🤔What would it look like to design a training program like The Disney Institute, but designed around digital-first businesses over customer-service businesses?Part 2: Becoming Customer CentricOk, so we’ve taken a view across the landscape and explored what it means to be customer centric a little. But how do you become customer centric? In particular, I think the key idea is not “how do you get an organization to be customer centric?” but rather “how do you get a key executive to become customer centric?”.There are various guides about organizations becoming customer centric like this good piece by Survey Monkey:But something about this makes me feel uneasy - internal satisfaction surveys? It all feels a bit like paying lip service to an idea that needs to be deeply ingrained. A measured approach to something unmeasurable, a tangible approach to something intangible…My lived experience working with founders, CEOs and executives is that the power is in something more personal. It’s not about a company-wide culture of being customer-centric as much as a singular vision, passion and voice for being customer centric that comes from a key executive that enables customer-centric decision making.👟👟👟Building Customer Journey MapsHere’s something that I know doesn’t work: telling executives that they have a blind spot. Sure, every executive will pretend to be self aware enough to invite this kind of feedback but… spoiler alert: very few actually are.So what might an executive intervention look like? Well, much like a Wardly map is non-confrontational tool to critically discuss strategy, maybe a customer service map is a non-confrontational tool to critically discuss customer-centric ideas. Here’s Aibnb’s customer service map (and tweet thread):We created a blueprint of the Airbnb experience and used it to improve our service end-to-end pic.twitter.com/KrDfZRbr0f&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) May 4, 2023Clearly Brian Chesky has the ability to channel the customer.Unfortunately, while this Airbnb example feels interesting - if you look around at the literature of customer journey maps you quickly realize that they’re not the right tool for changing an executives perspective…👟👟👟When I think about the most successful consulting engagements over the last 10 years, it’s the ones where I could help (in some small way) key executives view the world around them in a different light. To help them become slightly more attuned to the reality of customer experience and to be slightly better at putting themselves in the customer’s shoes.This rarely happens in a single moment, but rather through a gradual ongoing process of introspection, discussion and surprise. The surprise is key to jolting executives out of their established ways of looking and ways of thinking to consider things anew, to look at things with fresh eyes.👟👟👟Let’s wrap this up. I want to keep exploring this idea of customer-centric thinking, so here’s some open questions I have right now:  What is the distinction between a customer-centric culture and a single customer-centric executive? How are they different and the same? Is it possible for a bottoms-up approach to being customer-centric or can this only happen top down?  What are the systemic forces inside an organization that prevent executives from being customer-centric? Why is this a rare skill?  What metrics should businesses be measuring around customer experience? In a world where customers look at 3x the competitors they used to, how do you create a customer-first view of the alternatives and options that users have?  How might you build a training program like the disney institute designed to create new perspectives for executives, but designed for URL experiences, not IRL experiences?I’d love to hear your perspective!Want to continue the discussion? This idea started over on the Commoncog forums so come join in over there (you’ll need a paid Commoncog membership which I highly recommend anyway).            Andy is not without his flaws of course. &#8617;      "

But the articulation matters.✎ᝰA Company Story is PowerfulMy buddy Elan Miller who runs Off-Menu does exceptional brand strategy work. The best, truly. We’ve worked together on a number of projects and one thing I love is Elan’s ability to go beyond the brand to the actual company story.That’s what we aspire to do for our clients.

I see this tension with startups all the time:Businesses early in their development are often still largely owned and primarily shaped by their founders. A third critical question of internal logic that should be addressed explicitly rather than left to whim and chance is about how personal the business is: to what degree and in what ways the business is for its founders (or for some group of insiders which is meant to grow beyond the founders, as is the case for many partnership firms)?There are many things that founders or other key players who have the power to shape a venture’s evolution and to choose whether/how to make the venture meaningfully for them might want. They might aspire to pursue a certain vision of the world or to create wealth, which relate to the points we’ve explored above. They might want to be in charge, or to be able to focus on certain kinds of work they like doing, or to work with particular people whose company they enjoy, or to build their personal brands.At one end of a continuum is a business that’s created and fully acknowledged to be a “lifestyle business.” If two brothers want to restore classic cars together, make a certain level of income doing so, and take July and August off, more power to them. Would that every business should be so clear about its commitments.The great danger here lies in the middle ground, where the point of the organization isn’t explicitly meant to be the fulfillment of the founders’ vision for their own good lives, but where the personal desires of founders (or other powerful people) in fact shape a range of decisions. The founder who isn’t a strong CEO but who wants to be in charge (perhaps wants to be active in the business and “doesn’t want to have a boss” or perhaps just values being able to call all the shots) not only risks managing poorly, but risks undermining the belief that the organization truly stands for a commitment to something larger than himself. Strong founders and strong leaders make clear that they are accountable to higher goals and to impersonal standards—they create a “government of laws, not men.”@humanenterprise https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-businessHow does this internal logic seep into external narratives?✎ᝰNarrative as Engines of ChangeOk so far we have three different flavors of narrative strategy: the “strategic narrative”, the “company story” and the “internal logic”. Now let’s introduce another flavor: narratives as engines of change:Narratives play a crucial role in the strategy to address and resolve narrative discrepancies, combine and moderate stakeholder expectations from differing fields and clarify an organization’s positioning regarding broader social narratives. We propose that the use of narratives in a strategy goes well beyond the phenomenon of corporate storytelling. As contextual factors, narratives serve different goals than the mediation and dissemination of strategic decisions. We argue that this strategic use of narratives plays a particular role in organizational change situations. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13511610.2022.2062303?needAccess=trueThis frame of narratives as engines of change is, I suspect, why Jan Chipchase is writing a book about corporate sense making:Over the last two years I’ve been researching my next book on human and organisational sensemaking.

  "content": "I love my Remarkable 2. I’ve been using it pretty heavily for almost a year now. It’s my every day companion device. Here’s some notes and ideas.Note: this is all my personal opinion, I have no ties to Remarkable. Although they are one of my dream clients for 2024 so there’s that.✍️✍️✍️The Remarkable is Great at Reading &amp; Writing (and Arithmetic!)What do I use my Remarkable for? The three R’s - reading, writing and arithmetic.Core, daily usage:  Taking notes, capturing ideas, jotting down the day’s todo list. All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.  Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas. The kind of thing that is hard to do on a notebook because it involves zooming in and out, erasing sections, using straight lines etc.  Reading PDFs (and annotating with notes) - what a perfect form factor for reading PDFs! I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.  I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.Fun, quirky uses:  Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful. Roxy and I did that last night as I was helping her understand place value for tens and hundreds.  There are various game templates for the Remarkable that you can buy but I prefer to play something like drawing wars with my kids!And here’s a recent usage that I’m really digging - constructing a custom project tracker for my book writing project:The base layer is a PDF I made in Figma that then lets me track editing progress as I work through my Winter of Word Craft book sprint.✍️✍️✍️Fun Remarkable TemplatesI’ve also been playing around recently with some fun remarkable templates - things that work great on a drawing device. Like Wardly Maps:And Zenko maps:One thing I want to do is load up some sheet music on it (well, first I have to learn how to read sheet music. Actually maybe I should put a piano key template on there and I can just color in the keys I need to play…)If you can play this and tell me what song it is i have a project I want to work on together with you pic.twitter.com/d30KMj0dKU&mdash; Toby (@tobyshorin) November 1, 2023✍️✍️✍️Unsolicited Ideas for RemarkableHere’s some ideas I’d love:I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process. What if there was a “second screen mode” that could be a combination of live-data and note taking? Something like this:(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.✍️✍️✍️Giving Advice is Hard of CourseAs we know, giving advice is tricky. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…✍️✍️✍️Anyway - if you’re a Remarkable user, what are your workflows and setups? I’d love to compare notes!"

  "content": "I love my Remarkable 2. I’ve been using it pretty heavily for almost a year now. It’s my every day companion device. Here’s some notes and ideas.Note: this is all my personal opinion, I have no ties to Remarkable. Although they are one of my dream clients for 2024 so there’s that.✍️✍️✍️The Remarkable is Great at Reading &amp; Writing (and Arithmetic!)What do I use my Remarkable for? The three R’s - reading, writing and arithmetic.Core, daily usage:  Taking notes, capturing ideas, jotting down the day’s todo list. All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.  Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas. The kind of thing that is hard to do on a notebook because it involves zooming in and out, erasing sections, using straight lines etc.  Reading PDFs (and annotating with notes) - what a perfect form factor for reading PDFs! I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.  I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.Fun, quirky uses:  Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful. Roxy and I did that last night as I was helping her understand place value for tens and hundreds.  There are various game templates for the Remarkable that you can buy but I prefer to play something like drawing wars with my kids!And here’s a recent usage that I’m really digging - constructing a custom project tracker for my book writing project:The base layer is a PDF I made in Figma that then lets me track editing progress as I work through my Winter of Word Craft book sprint.✍️✍️✍️Fun Remarkable TemplatesI’ve also been playing around recently with some fun remarkable templates - things that work great on a drawing device. Like Wardly Maps:And Zenko maps:One thing I want to do is load up some sheet music on it (well, first I have to learn how to read sheet music. Actually maybe I should put a piano key template on there and I can just color in the keys I need to play…)If you can play this and tell me what song it is i have a project I want to work on together with you pic.twitter.com/d30KMj0dKU&mdash; Toby (@tobyshorin) November 1, 2023✍️✍️✍️Unsolicited Ideas for RemarkableHere’s some ideas I’d love:I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day.

  "date": "January 31, 2024",
  "content": "What to say about the future of AI and search?Obviously, we don’t know. But I’m going to jot down a few thoughts.🤖🤖🤖Clicks to Websites will go up/down/sideways?There’s an interesting spectrum of responses to the new “generative search experiences” and what it means for clicks out to websites.The super optimistic outlook says:“Generative search &amp; AI is going to absolutely explode the number of search queries per user per day. Just like mobile search and youtube search are largely additive to “regular” search, we’re going to see more search queries than ever and eventually more outbound clicks than ever before”The pragmatic positive outlook says:“Look, Google’s ads business model relies on showing you links and driving clicks to websites. So however the future interface changes there’s going to be a fundamental notion of links and clicks that will continue to exist. So there will be changes big and small to the number of clicks but ultimately it’s not going to be a “50% decline in all search” scenario”The pragmatic pessimist outlook says:“Sure, search click curves are going to change - but actually for A LOT of queries you simply don’t need to click out - the query is well served by an LLM model. While many transactional queries will survive, the informational and exploratory queries will be completely re-shaped. This will lead to broad-scale changes across the media landscape in particular.The super pessimistic outlook says:“LLMs are going to fundamentally rewrite how people interact with the web to the point that search itself diminishes as a behavior - leading not only to dramatically fewer clicks to websites but even Google’s core ads business model will come under threat.”Whichever outlook you have, I think one thing is becoming obvious - with how fast open source and small local models are getting - I don’t think search is going to be threatened by a membership model (a la $20 / month for chatGPT). I think search is going to remain free and ad supported for some time to come.1🤖🤖🤖Just-in-time InterfacesThere’s another outlook though - maybe the era of search-first is just over? What I mean is this - you could argue that today we start our queries in search (just like we used to start our search in directories many moons ago). Whether it’s voice search, Google search etc we start there.But you could argue that we’re entering an era where we start our queries with an LLM/assistant interface. Something that results in search some of the time - but NOT all the time. Some times it results in novel, new interfaces - whether it’s a just-in-time UI that is assembled to support your task completion or whether it’s a collaborative document / code environment.I’ve been playing around with a workflow that goes something like:  Tell GPT what I want to do  Ask GPT to think about what interface would enable that task completion  Ask GPT to give me the code for that interface  Copy and paste that code into ReplitThis is all quite manual and a little bit slow today - but when it gets it right, the results are magical and truly novel. I could easily imagine a new OpenAI beta playground environment that tried to build interfaces on the fly for you. It’s all there today.See: the tldraw experiment that lets you draw a UI and have GPT build a working version.(Aside: Google search results are essentially adaptive UI designed for the query at this point! I mean look at the custom ecommerce UI all over a standard shopping query these days.)🤖🤖🤖What new kinds of queries will exist?Ok, so if we have a different kind of box to type or talk into - how will this differ from a search box? Well, I think the affordances of natural language will change the kinds of behaviors that we find ourselves familiar with.Here’s a simple example. People used to search for things with specific location modifiers - think “restaurants in NYC” but as it became obvious and predictable that Google already knows where the query is coming from, we stopped searching for “restaurants in NYC” and started searching for “restaurants near me”.The “near me” version of queries became the dominant version about 10 years ago.So the affordances of the search results changes our behavior.It’s fun to imagine whole new kinds of search queries / questions that you simply wouldn’t type into Google because it wouldn’t make sense. Things like:  Why am I feeling anxious today?  What should I work on today?  Should I take the job offer I was just sent?  Can I afford a holiday this year?  Give me a poem to start my dayI’m betting that as we get comfortable talking to LLMs we’ll slowly get comfortable asking more personal, more spiritual, more emotional, more goal-oriented questions and discussions.(Obviously, I’m guessing the real queries of the future will look nothing like this - it’ll be some other weird second order effect that no one anticipated)🤖🤖🤖We’re going to need new ideas for measurementTwo things we’re going to need to invent new ideas around measurement for: search quality and search rankings.Google hasn’t had any serious competition for decades - and so collectively I think we’ve all kind of given up on measuring search quality? Even Google I think has become lazy in how they measure search quality in recent years.But it’s suddenly a serious question to ask who did it better for a particular category of search.(In 10 minutes I built a little side by side for Google and Perplexity. Play around here: https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/)Of course - it’s not quite true that no one is measuring search quality. Daniel S. Griffin has a really interesting collection of articles, academic papers and resources around “search audits”. Ok, so I guess we all have some homework to do.But/and - because the affordances are changing and search behavior is changing we’re still going to need some careful thinking around how we measure the quality of search results.Meanwhile, in the SEO industry, we’ve been relying on “rank tracking” for a long time (too long?). I’m excited that this new era of generative search experiences might usher in some innovation from the SEO tool providers around how we measure performance in search. It’s needed.🤖🤖🤖Actually, there’s a third thing we’re going to need to invent new measurement standards for: clicks. AI-assisted clicks. Do they show in analytics? Do bots declare themselves? When a bot browses on your behalf what user-agent does it use? Are bots allowed to fetch URLs on your behalf if they do it locally? Or only via direct user-initiated command?🤖🤖🤖The Skill of SearchingHere’s another way of thinking about the impact of LLMs.You know how some people are just better at searching than others? If you’re reading this article you’re probably thinking that you’re good at searching. Maybe your significant other turns to you to help you find the right thing, maybe you feel like you’re competent at weeding through 10 blue links to find the most relevant result. You’re fluent and competent at the internet.Being good at searching is a combination of query formulation, looking for signs, recognizing trusted sites etc.Well, studies find that for knowledge worker tasks, LLMs lift the below average people the most and close the gap between top and bottom performers:Across a set of 18 tasks designed to test a range of business skills - from analysis to idea generation to persuasion - consultants who had previously tested in the lower half of the group increased the quality of their outputs by 43% with AI help while the top half only gained 17%. Where previously the gap between the average performances of top and bottom performers was 22%, it shrunk to a mere 4% once the consultants used GPT-4.Ethan Mollick https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/everyone-is-above-average?publication_id=1180644&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;r=kSo, maybe our model for how search will evolve is instead of imagining your average person searching for a generic query, imagine them being as good as you are at searching. How would that change your ideas for the future of search behavior?After all - maybe you’re the obsessive nerd who opens 15 tabs for every search. Well, everyone can do that now:🤖🤖🤖Context &amp; PersistenceIt’s clear to me that two missing “obvious” ideas from the LLM chat interfaces we have today are context and persistence.Context - because although you can write your own custom GPTs and so on, today even Bard doesn’t have access to your calendar, your email and your chats. Surely the eventual assistant will have much more awareness of who you are, what you’re working on, where you are etc. This is part of the bull case for Apple/Google dominance in the AI era.Persistence - why can’t I ask GPT to remind me next month about something? Or to notify when some future thing happens? This feels like Google Alerts (or Yahoo Pipes) on steroids and it’s simply a quirk of the technology today that they don’t do this. I think before the year is out GPT will have a way of sending you alerts, notifications and reminders.My friends at Addition are building a kind of LLM-powered Google Alerts here in early beta: Insightly🤖🤖🤖Of course - the future will be agents, doing tasks with you and for you. Acting on your behalf. I think we’re a little ways off from that happening for anything beyond basic tasks today - but it’ll come, and when it does we’ll need new paradigms for all kinds of things.🤖🤖🤖Publishers &amp; Poisoned WellsDo you remember the poisoned well argument around Google AMP? Basically publishers hated Google AMP because it broke the rules of the web - Google acting like a hosted intermediary between Google and publishers. But of course Google argued that if publishers didn’t have such shitty websites covered in ads and bloat and crap, AMP wouldn’t be needed.Well.I think we’re going to see a very similar story play out with Google vs publishers. The publishers right now are up in arms that Google could use LLMs to answer queries, thus reducing clicks to the “open web”. And yet - in conversations I’m having with publishers and brands behind the scenes, companies are desperate for traffic and many are planning for large-scale deployment of AI-written content.Honestly - I’m not sure this is a bad thing! There’s a lot of very terrible human-written content out there.But of course this is going to trigger a bit of an arms race where Google points to all the AI-generated bloat and spam from publishers as an excuse for introducing their AI experiences.🤖🤖🤖Here’s one idea - everyone is focused on generating indexable content for Google to consume and rank.Maybe the future is indexable experiences.No, I don’t care to explain myself.Ok alright, well I think most content that brands create should actually be an experience. A little web-app that helps you. For example for a query like “how to get slime out of carpet”2 - I don’t want an article with 1000 words of SEO-focused garbage with the history of slime, headers answering all the “FAQs” like “what is slime”.What I want is a little slime helper that says “what kind of slime is it? how long has it been there? do you have vinegar?” then gives me some help to guide me through.I mean, what I really want is to yell at my kids. Maybe an LLM can help me parent better in the future. Maybe an LLM can stop my kids putting slime on the carpet in the future. See above: new kinds of queries.No, I don’t know how “indexable experiences” will work. Do you?🤖🤖🤖The only certain thing is uncertaintyHere’s a nice analogy from Sean Blanda around how the fundamental predictability of platforms has changed:Much like stable national business and predictable tax policy attract investment, stable internet platforms attract makers and creators. I'm more willing to build my audience on your service if I can expect a reasonable amount of stability and predictability. For more than a decade, Google, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn had stable rules and incentives. However, thanks to a mix of AI and changing market conditions, each of these platforms is now antagonistic to linking to outside sources. Their reliance on humans to create chum for the algorithm may be temporary as AI and machine-generated content are now easier to create.As a creator, journalist, or brand, you can no longer reliably pour money or labor into a platform and have it reliably return an audience that you can turn into customers. As a result, audience growth has slowed across the board.@seanblanda https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/I’ve seen personally how much this lack of predictability has paralyzed client budgets. Most companies are not very good at operating in uncertainty. (I’m guessing Vaughn Tan is very much in demand right now).🤖🤖🤖Some default recommendations that I’m using with clients I work with:  Put AI in the loop for content creation today, but be very thoughtful in creating AI content without humans in the loop.  I’m more interested in AI-generated experiences than I am AI-generated content. AI-generated experiences can start very simply but are surprisingly scaleable. Remember that intent / information gain / task completion is always the goal.  Developing AI capabilities is more important than knowing exactly where it shows up or how you’ll use it. This typically means starting with a small pilot, and carefully talking about it and sharing it internally.  CRM is a huge opportunity for AI (though I suppose CRM was always a huge opportunity - but it was neglected even before AI).  Now is a great time to carefully consider the question of “quality content” and “quality experiences” - for a long time companies operated without a strong definition or measurement of quality. “Humans made it” was a proxy for “it’s good” but now we need new benchmarks and metrics for what “good”. We need that before we can start using AI.  Yes, once you have a clear understanding of “quality” an LLM can be very useful in quality control.🤖🤖🤖We invented computers and they changed everything. And then one day we discovered they can talk…🤖🤖🤖Beep boop. What are you thinking about?Update from a cold room later that same day, Jan 31st: Jared Hecht has a nice little riff on agent native applications that provokes the question of whether web3 enters the chat. This piece helped me think a bit more deeply about the role of aggregators, data layers and protocols as it relates to search.Here’s an interesting perspective. For a keyword like “best laptop”, Google could already remove the middle-man of publishers regurgitating 4,000 comparison pieces. But they choose not to. For how long? And in an agent-first world we might need more headless brands where attribution and kickbacks and royalties are paid out to various players along the value chain…Update #2: Feb 5th: I saw this excellent demo of just-in-time interfaces assembled using AI - starts around 3min in.            Which means that one of the most interesting areas of research right now is how you put ads inside an LLM! The greatest minds of our generation etc etc. But this is a trillion dollar problem and it doesn’t seem like there’s much progress yet? &#8617;              Yes, an actual search query from 1am last night. Thanks kids. &#8617;      "

Do you?🤖🤖🤖The only certain thing is uncertaintyHere’s a nice analogy from Sean Blanda around how the fundamental predictability of platforms has changed:Much like stable national business and predictable tax policy attract investment, stable internet platforms attract makers and creators. I'm more willing to build my audience on your service if I can expect a reasonable amount of stability and predictability. For more than a decade, Google, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn had stable rules and incentives. However, thanks to a mix of AI and changing market conditions, each of these platforms is now antagonistic to linking to outside sources. Their reliance on humans to create chum for the algorithm may be temporary as AI and machine-generated content are now easier to create.As a creator, journalist, or brand, you can no longer reliably pour money or labor into a platform and have it reliably return an audience that you can turn into customers. As a result, audience growth has slowed across the board.@seanblanda https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/I’ve seen personally how much this lack of predictability has paralyzed client budgets. Most companies are not very good at operating in uncertainty. (I’m guessing Vaughn Tan is very much in demand right now).🤖🤖🤖Some default recommendations that I’m using with clients I work with:  Put AI in the loop for content creation today, but be very thoughtful in creating AI content without humans in the loop.  I’m more interested in AI-generated experiences than I am AI-generated content. AI-generated experiences can start very simply but are surprisingly scaleable. Remember that intent / information gain / task completion is always the goal.  Developing AI capabilities is more important than knowing exactly where it shows up or how you’ll use it. This typically means starting with a small pilot, and carefully talking about it and sharing it internally.  CRM is a huge opportunity for AI (though I suppose CRM was always a huge opportunity - but it was neglected even before AI).  Now is a great time to carefully consider the question of “quality content” and “quality experiences” - for a long time companies operated without a strong definition or measurement of quality. “Humans made it” was a proxy for “it’s good” but now we need new benchmarks and metrics for what “good”. We need that before we can start using AI.  Yes, once you have a clear understanding of “quality” an LLM can be very useful in quality control.🤖🤖🤖We invented computers and they changed everything. And then one day we discovered they can talk…🤖🤖🤖Beep boop. What are you thinking about?Update from a cold room later that same day, Jan 31st: Jared Hecht has a nice little riff on agent native applications that provokes the question of whether web3 enters the chat. This piece helped me think a bit more deeply about the role of aggregators, data layers and protocols as it relates to search.Here’s an interesting perspective. For a keyword like “best laptop”, Google could already remove the middle-man of publishers regurgitating 4,000 comparison pieces. But they choose not to. For how long? And in an agent-first world we might need more headless brands where attribution and kickbacks and royalties are paid out to various players along the value chain…Update #2: Feb 5th: I saw this excellent demo of just-in-time interfaces assembled using AI - starts around 3min in.            Which means that one of the most interesting areas of research right now is how you put ads inside an LLM! The greatest minds of our generation etc etc. But this is a trillion dollar problem and it doesn’t seem like there’s much progress yet? &#8617;              Yes, an actual search query from 1am last night.

  "content": "  “It is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor’s job is to be helpful.” David Maister - The Trusted Advisor“I can DO IT!” my 7 year old screams at me. She asked for help with her homework, but now - half way through explaining the place value of numbers - she had enough of my help and was physically and emotionally pushing me away - “I can DO IT already”.Of course, she proceeded to not be able to do it.“Yes I know that!” I shouted in exasperation. I was making pancakes for the kids and had only skim-read the recipe. As a result I had forgotten to melt the butter before adding it to the mixture and it was all lumpy. My partner Erin looked over and said “you should have melted the butter before you put it in, would you like me to give you a recipe?”. I had a recipe, but obviously I hadn’t followed it and knew that I had made a mistake. “I KNOW I should have melted the butter, that’s not helpful to me right now!”.Giving advice is emotionally fraught and complicated. It’s true for 7 year olds, it’s true for me and it’s true for my clients.Giving advice is an intensely personal thing. The feeling of learning something new sits right next to the feeling of shame for not knowing it in the first place. And worse, in the client/consultant relationship, the client is at least partially complicit in the situation when they come to you.So, some of the things that might seem “obvious” to you as a consultant can actually be incredibly delicate and problematic. Consider:  Quickly pointing out potential problems with the situation  Immediately offering a solution to these problems  Stating that things are easily solvedYou do these things because you want to be seen as an expert, you want to reassure the client that you have the answer and that the client is in good hands.But think carefully about how these things make the client feel. They can make the client feel stupid, it can place a fair share of blame on the client for the situation and it can make them feel like you didn’t listen carefully enough to their description of the problem before leaping to solutions.So in this chapter we’re going to look at ways to resist the urge to add immediate value. Instead we have to hold space for a more vulnerable, honest and open relationship with our client - to allow them to open up more fully and to work on things that are useful, even if not in scope.From Consultant to AdvisorIn the book Trusted Advisor by David Maister (highly recommended!) there is a a nice illustration that shows the evolution of client/consultant relationships as you get more senior and more strategic:Giving advice is fraught even if the problem is well defined and you do know the answer. So when you’re working on strategic, ill-defined projects where there isn’t a right answer - giving advice is incredibly delicate, and in some cases not even possible.Eventually in your career you might even stop thinking of yourself as a consultant and start thinking of yourself as an advisor.And as we see in the diagram - in order to get access to the deeper emotional layers of advice giving and receiving we need to formulate a close relationship with our clients.While giving advice can help you be seen as knowledgeable, it doesn’t necessarily build trust.“You should…” is a dangerous phraseOne of the biggest mistakes a consultant can make is to think that you’re there to give advice and solve client problems. It’s so easy to let this little phrase creep into your work:“You should…”It’s a simple sounding phrase but it gets you in trouble more often than not. It’s problematic for two reasons: it assumes a control of client resources and it’s too prescriptive in form:1. “You should…” assumes you can allocate client resourcesIt’s a fundamental mistake to assume that as a consultant we can allocate client resources. We typically don’t have a complete view of everything that the company is working on, we don’t have a detailed understanding of how long things actually take or the full range of dependencies required for them.Barging into a client saying that they should do something implies a kind of confidence and bravado that can be arrogant at best and ignorant at worst.Think about the last time you saw a project through from start to finish - the range of complexities, dependencies, hurdles, different work streams and so on required to get it over the finish line are almost certainly missing from the overly-confident and overly-simplistic “You should…”The simple way that this phrase goes wrong is by under-estimating the resource complexity of a task:  Example: working with a client where I wanted to re-design a landing page on their site to improve it. Unfortunately I was under-estimating the number of people who need to be involved since the landing pages were still owned by the product team and are technically part of the same codebase as the full tech product. So a “small” change required detailed security scrutiny and QA before going live. Making “simple” changes was not in fact simple at all here.But there’s also under-estimating the political complexity of the task:  Example: working with the NYTimes cooking team I suggested that they should re-tag their content. This kind of “you should…” recommendation seemed straightforward but neglected the political considerations - the team had just spent 6-figures on re-tagging all their recipes - so to ask for further budget to re-do a task they had just done would lose them face internally. A “straightforward” change that actually carried a bunch of political baggage.Some other types of complexity that you might be under-estimating with regards resource allocation:  Regulation/compliance complexity - which either prevents you even doing your recommendation or makes it slower.  Technical complexity - while something might be technically easy, doing it with the client’s existing technology might be hard.  Data complexity - a simple seeming request on the surface (make a landing page for every neighborhood) might actually depend on a robust, maintained data set that doesn’t yet exist.  Maintenance complexity - even if the initial request to create something or do something is not resource intensive, it might come with an implicit agreement to continue to maintain it - expanding the resources allocated.  Production complexity - where what you’re proposing isn’t that expensive or resource intensive to do, but the client (for whatever reason) has a higher quality threshold, making the recommendation more expensive/slower/harder than you anticipated.  Narrative complexity - where what you’re recommending seems reasonable but either the company has tried it before, or a competitor has tried it before or there’s a general sense that “this doesn’t work”. Which can make your recommendation extremely hard to actually get done.2. “You should…” is too prescriptive in formIn addition to under-estimating the problem, we also over-fit the solution. After all, as we saw in the chapter The Consultant’s Grain, as independent consultants we often bias towards our own natural strengths and areas of expertise.When we say “You should…” we’re essentially offering a problem diagnosis AND a solution at the same time. The consequence of this is that we’re essentially asking the client to accept or reject both together.Instead, most of your work would be more effective at actually changing clients if you stopped to clearly separate the diagnosis from the solution. If you don’t properly win over all the necessary stakeholders at the client’s side you’re going to face resistance trying to get anything done.  Example: I was working with Gartner Digital Markets on some SEO strategy and I felt that we needed to work on some more transformative work than simple technical SEO fixes - their core landing pages were offering a worse user experience than the competition and we were losing ground.  Persuading the rest of the organization that this was a problem wasn’t straightforward. We’d been saying that these pages needed overhauling and it felt like no one was listening. So we ran a small user survey to ask a series of 10 “Google quality rater questions”. This allowed us to present our findings to the senior leadership team at Gartner and I remember showing something like this:    Instantly, people leaned in around the table and there was a lot of executive interest. Saying something like “we should improve our pages” is too bland and generic - it only serves to win over people who already agree with you. It lacks any kind of rigor or weight to win someone over who already has their own opinions and roadmap.  In this situation - the survey allowed us to quantify the problem correctly and provided compelling evidence, we didn’t even need to offer a solution! Articulating the problem was enough to convince the necessary teams to take action and prioritize work.So if you’re asking “You should…” to the client, stop and examine if you’ve properly defined the situation and provided evidence for the problem, to help the client deeply internalize the problem and win over the necessary stakeholders before you propose any kind of solution.A good mental exercise to ensure you’re doing the work here is to ask yourself: what happens if the client takes no action? What is the consequence of the current trajectory, or the null case of no investment? This will help you bring some rigor to the question of what the consequence of the problem truly is and allow the problem to be quantified relative to other projects and investment opportunities.So, what’s the alternative?“There is an opportunity to…”This phrase is the key - it places the focus correctly on first defining the problem - and then providing evidence - before focusing on the solution. It allows us to articulate and quantify the opportunity while leaving room for the client to have say over resource allocation, for the client to shape the solution and for the client to determine prioritization and timing.Of course in reality, you’re often involved in shaping the solution too - but it’s crucial to ensure that you’re not skipping over the step of clearly defining the size and shape of the opportunity before getting to the solution.  Example: Working with an ecommerce site to define an SEO strategy part of my recommendation involved investing in content strategy to drive links, traffic and conversions - but before even getting into the shape of the solution, i.e. how we would invest in content it’s important to articulate what the opportunity is.  By looking at relevant competitors we can estimate the potential traffic and revenue opportunity:    By showing what’s possible, clients are able to feel more invested in designing the solution with you, rather than just being told what to do.This can also be uncomfortable! There are many situations where quantifying the exact opportunity is difficult, requires estimation or requires a different approach (like we saw with the Gartner surveys).But consider the alternative - the alternative is recommending something to the client… because we say so?This isn’t necessarily wrong - there’s value in expert opinion - but in my experience clients deeply appreciate you clearly separating out expert opinion and judgment from evidence-based analysis.As David Maister says in the Trusted Advisor - the best approach is:  A good process for the advisor to follow is:      Give them their options    Give them an education about their options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth)    Give them a recommendation    Let them choose  This stance essentially allows you as the consultant to own the diagnosis and quantification of the opportunity and then collaboratively with the client to shape the solution and prioritization.Let’s look at the problem togetherTaking a collaborative stance with your client is powerful. There are many aspects of consulting that are almost combative by nature - like pointing out problems the client has (that the client was complicit in creating!).As we saw in the chapter Optimism as an Operating System, walking into a client with a critical eye can create a distance between you and the client.Instead you want to create a kind of shoulder-to-shoulder stance with the client, facing towards the problems together. This creates a much safer, judgment free way to look at the problems (and opportunities) facing the client.In fact, for senior executives - sometimes you really can’t give them advice - they’re too type-A and overly confident. The only way to convince them is to help them see the problem in a new light - to see things as you see them.This idea is demonstrated beautifully by Timothy Gallway in The Inner Game of Tennis where he recounts teaching a senior executive how to improve their backhand:  One day in the summer of 1971 when I was teaching a group of men at John Gardiner’s Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, a businessman realized how much more power and control he got on his backhand when his racket was taken back below the level of the ball. He was so enthusiastic about his “new” stroke that he rushed to tell his friend Jack about it as if some kind of miracle had occurred. Jack, who considered his erratic backhand one of the major problems of his life, came rushing up to me during the lunch hour, exclaiming, “I’ve always had a terrible backhand. Maybe you can help me.”  I asked, “What’s so terrible about your backhand?”  “I take my racket back too high on my backswing.”  “How do you know?”  “Because at least five different pros have told me so. I just haven’t been able to correct it.”  For a brief moment I was aware of the absurdity of the situation. Here was a business executive who controlled large commercial enterprises of great complexity asking me for help as if he had no control over his own right arm. Why wouldn’t it be possible, I wondered, to give him the simple reply, “Sure, I can help you. L-o-w-e-r y-o-u-r r-a-c-k-e-t!”  But complaints such as Jack’s are common among people of all levels of intelligence and proficiency. Besides, it was clear that at least five other pros had told him to lower his racket without much effect. What was keeping him from doing it? I wondered.  I asked Jack to take a few swings on the patio where we were standing. His backswing started back very low, but then, sure enough, just before swinging forward it lifted to the level of his shoulder and swung down into the imagined ball. The five pros were right. I asked him to swing several more times without making any comment. “Isn’t that better?” he asked. “I tried to keep it low.” But each time just before swinging forward, his racket lifted; it was obvious that had he been hitting an actual ball, the underspin imparted by the downward swing would have caused it to sail out. “Your backhand is all right,” I said reassuringly. “It’s just going through some changes. Why don’t you take a closer look at it.” We walked over to a large windowpane and there I asked him to swing again while watching his reflection. He did so, again taking his characteristic hitch at the back of his swing, but this time he was astounded. “Hey, I really do take my racket back high! It goes up above my shoulder!” There was no judgment in his voice; he was just reporting with amazement what his eyes had seen.  What surprised me was Jack’s surprise. Hadn’t he said that five pros had told him his racket was too high? I was certain that if I had told him the same thing after his first swing, he would have replied, “Yes, I know.” But what was now clear was that he didn’t really know, since no one is ever surprised at seeing something they already know. Despite all those lessons, he had never directly experienced his racket going back high. His mind had been so absorbed in the process of judgment and trying to change this “bad” stroke that he had never perceived the stroke itself.  Looking in the glass which mirrored his stroke as it was, Jack was able to keep his racket low quite effortlessly as he swung again. “That feels entirely different than any backhand I’ve ever swung,” he declared. By now he was swinging up and through the ball over and over again. Interestingly, he wasn’t congratulating himself for doing it right; he was simply absorbed in how different it felt.  After lunch I threw Jack a few balls and he was able to remember how the stroke felt and to repeat the action. This time he just felt where his racket was going, letting his sense of feel replace the visual image offered by the mirror. It was a new experience for him. Soon he was consistently hitting topspin backhands into the court with an effortlessness that made it appear this was his natural swing. In ten minutes he was feeling “in the groove,” and he paused to express his gratitude. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you’ve done for me. I’ve learned more in ten minutes from you than in twenty hours of lessons I’ve taken on my backhand.” I could feel something inside me begin to puff up as it absorbed these “good” words. At the same time, I didn’t know quite how to handle this lavish compliment, and found myself hemming and hawing, trying to come up with an appropriately modest reply. Then, for a moment, my mind turned off and I realized that I hadn’t given Jack a single instruction on his backhand! “But what did I teach you?” I asked. He was quiet for a full half-minute, trying to remember what I had told him. Finally he said, “I can’t remember your telling me anything! You were just there watching, and you got me watching myself closer than I ever had before. Instead of seeing what was wrong with my backhand, I just started observing, and improvement seemed to happen on its own. I’m not sure why, but I certainly learned a lot in a short period of time.” He had learned, but had he been “taught”?This is about tennis (is it?) but equally applies to consulting! I find in my own work that senior executives are often blocked by some inability to see what’s actually going on - and that telling them is useless! Instead you need to help them see it for themselves.Because of their distance from the day to day work, senior executives are especially prone to replacing some version of reality with a compressed narrative. And when this compressed narrative is wrong in some key way you need to return to first principles to show them (not tell them!).Much like we saw with the example of the Gartner surveys - helping clients see with fresh eyes what’s really going is powerful and can be profoundly useful before you even begin suggesting solutions.Understanding the problem in all of its emotional and political complexityOnce you adopt this collaborative stance with the client you begin to see that the problems as you thought you understood them, are not in fact the full picture.Your sense of “what’s going on” with a client is intermediated by your point of contact and it turns out that your client is an unreliable narrator. Remember - best case they have problems they’ve been unable to solve on their own, worst case they were actively responsible for creating the problems in the first place!So it’s no wonder that clients often down-play, mis-represent and mask the full emotional and political complexity of what’s going on. Especially when you first start working together and haven’t yet earned their trust.But for you to do your job it’s crucial that you get a full picture of what’s really going on. And further, clients deeply appreciate a consultant that can listen and observe closely enough to see what’s really going on.As David Maister says in The Consultant’s Role:  “It can be unsettling to find that the client is primarily interested in having his or her problem understood, in all its emotional and political complexity, as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.”What this is saying is that you need to earn the client’s trust in order to be effective at your job. This isn’t at all obvious! When a client comes to you asking for a “content strategy” or support “hiring a VP marketing” it all seems so straightforward, rational and well defined. But as you unpack the layers of the onion you begin to realize why it’s been so hard for the client to help themselves. And that’s when the emotional and political complexity of the problem starts to come into view.Developing a sensitivity to the emotional and political context of client problems requires an active listening and sensing instinct on behalf of the consultant - to use your own lived experience inside the client’s organization as a way to sense what the inner work life is like inside your client’s business. As Ruth Orenstein says in her book Multidimensional Executive Coaching:  For the time he/she is present, the consultant becomes part of the multidimensional system, both influencing it and being influenced by it. To do the work of executive coach- ing, then, the consultant must be able to tolerate, and ultimately make use of, entering a highly complex place-a place that is occupied by neither the individual nor the organization alone but, because of their convergence, both the individual and the organization together; a place that contains both the exigencies of working life and the impulses of the psyche; and a place that engages and, in turn, is engaged by the consultant’s own intrapsychic material. In addition, if the work is done effectively, it requires that the consultant be both involved enough in the dynamics so as to experience their impact and detached enough so as to analyze what is transpiring. These demands make imperative the use of oneself as tool.Remember: when clients first come to you, your first instinct might be to dismiss the problem as “easily solved”. But you need to hold space to truly consider that the thing that seems easy is, in this particular situation, with this particular client actually not at all easy. And that’s when the work begins.The Next Most Useful ThingThis all builds up to my personal consulting mantra: always work on the next most useful thing.This mantra helps remind me that consulting isn’t about being right, it’s about being useful.As a consultant - it’s crucial that you’re generating momentum, that clients can feel a sense of progress in your work. A consultant is typically an expensive investment and without a sense of progress or momentum your engagement will stall out.Importantly however, a sense of progress and momentum doesn’t have to come from the official SOW or project plan. Actual progress is one thing - but a sense of progress is just that - it’s about your client feeling like things are moving forward.In fact, depending on the project and the client - moving at the expected pace can be too slow! Even after agreeing on a scope, project plan and set of next steps, moving as fast as you said you would can be disappointing to the client.Remember - building a great client relationship is about trust. And doing the minimum doesn’t build trust. So it’s important to demonstrate to the client that you’re willing to do the extra work, to go a little further, to do the unexpected.This doesn’t require a ton of extra time but it does require some deliberate effort and sensitivity - to think about the client’s reality - the meetings, projects, pressures they’re facing right now - and think about how you can proactively support them.You could re-draw the diagram from up above as follows:Whether your client is facing an important decision, or preparing for a board meeting or working through a bunch of menial tasks - whatever it is there’s typically a way for you to help out in some small way. And in doing so the client feels a sense of momentum and builds a sense of trust between you.What’s the next most useful thing?It’s not about ignoring the SOW or the project plan but it’s about recognizing that there’s value in giving your client a sense of momentum.  Example: I worked with a B2B saas client a few years ago - they were a small startup looking to raise their series B round and we engaged to create a content strategy.  On this project I made a mistake and despite the fact the client didn’t have any in-house editorial resources I took their request at face value and we structured the project around a 6-week content strategy.  I delivered what I think is good quality work with a deeply researched and evidence-based 66-page strategy for producing content and…. Nothing happened? They were happy enough with the work product but it didn’t lead to any material change in their strategy or an ongoing consulting relationship.  In hindsight the key mistake here was not asking myself enough what the next most useful thing was. I think if I’d been more honest about what would add value and show momentum for the client it would have been either a) condensed one or two slide summary of the content opportunity for their fundraising deck and/or b) supporting their VP marketing recruitment effort.  Perhaps I should have done both. Either way - it turns out that what the client wanted wasn’t really what the client needed and this mismatch led to a fairly unproductive engagement.Recognizing that clients are unreliable narrators when it comes to scoping projects and defining timelines allows for a more philosophical view of value when it comes to consulting.Is a 6 week strategy project really the most useful thing the client needs right now? What happens at that point when we have the strategy defined - then what? By seeking more context, clarity and insight into momentum we can more easily work on things that the client will truly appreciate, not just provide things the client asked for.A Conclusion About OwlsThere’s an internet meme about giving advice that I love. It’s an image that shows you how to draw an owl:Too much bad consulting work looks like either step 1 or step 2. Either you’re telling the client “draw some circles” and the client is frustrated the advice is too basic and high level. Or you’re telling the client to “draw the rest of the fucking owl” and are ignoring the detailed reality of the situation and the limitations of teams, resources and capabilities.Or worse, the client asked you for help drawing owls but what they’re really doing is painting a woodland scene…Think about this image next time a client comes to you for help drawing owls - your first response shouldn’t be “Oh, that’s easy, first you draw some circles”, it should be “Show me how your owls look today. What do you think is holding you back from drawing better owls? And why is drawing owls important to you right now?”Remember - it’s about adopting a collaborative, trusted stance with clients. And that might require resisting your initial urge to give advice. Instead you need to listen to the full emotional and political situation and then work with the client to re-examine reality in new and surprising ways.Always work on the next most useful thing. And that doesn’t always involve doing what the client asked for."

Technical complexity - while something might be technically easy, doing it with the client’s existing technology might be hard.  Data complexity - a simple seeming request on the surface (make a landing page for every neighborhood) might actually depend on a robust, maintained data set that doesn’t yet exist.  Maintenance complexity - even if the initial request to create something or do something is not resource intensive, it might come with an implicit agreement to continue to maintain it - expanding the resources allocated.  Production complexity - where what you’re proposing isn’t that expensive or resource intensive to do, but the client (for whatever reason) has a higher quality threshold, making the recommendation more expensive/slower/harder than you anticipated.  Narrative complexity - where what you’re recommending seems reasonable but either the company has tried it before, or a competitor has tried it before or there’s a general sense that “this doesn’t work”. Which can make your recommendation extremely hard to actually get done.2. “You should…” is too prescriptive in formIn addition to under-estimating the problem, we also over-fit the solution. After all, as we saw in the chapter The Consultant’s Grain, as independent consultants we often bias towards our own natural strengths and areas of expertise.When we say “You should…” we’re essentially offering a problem diagnosis AND a solution at the same time. The consequence of this is that we’re essentially asking the client to accept or reject both together.Instead, most of your work would be more effective at actually changing clients if you stopped to clearly separate the diagnosis from the solution. If you don’t properly win over all the necessary stakeholders at the client’s side you’re going to face resistance trying to get anything done.  Example: I was working with Gartner Digital Markets on some SEO strategy and I felt that we needed to work on some more transformative work than simple technical SEO fixes - their core landing pages were offering a worse user experience than the competition and we were losing ground.  Persuading the rest of the organization that this was a problem wasn’t straightforward. We’d been saying that these pages needed overhauling and it felt like no one was listening. So we ran a small user survey to ask a series of 10 “Google quality rater questions”. This allowed us to present our findings to the senior leadership team at Gartner and I remember showing something like this:    Instantly, people leaned in around the table and there was a lot of executive interest. Saying something like “we should improve our pages” is too bland and generic - it only serves to win over people who already agree with you. It lacks any kind of rigor or weight to win someone over who already has their own opinions and roadmap.  In this situation - the survey allowed us to quantify the problem correctly and provided compelling evidence, we didn’t even need to offer a solution! Articulating the problem was enough to convince the necessary teams to take action and prioritize work.So if you’re asking “You should…” to the client, stop and examine if you’ve properly defined the situation and provided evidence for the problem, to help the client deeply internalize the problem and win over the necessary stakeholders before you propose any kind of solution.A good mental exercise to ensure you’re doing the work here is to ask yourself: what happens if the client takes no action? What is the consequence of the current trajectory, or the null case of no investment? This will help you bring some rigor to the question of what the consequence of the problem truly is and allow the problem to be quantified relative to other projects and investment opportunities.So, what’s the alternative?“There is an opportunity to…”This phrase is the key - it places the focus correctly on first defining the problem - and then providing evidence - before focusing on the solution. It allows us to articulate and quantify the opportunity while leaving room for the client to have say over resource allocation, for the client to shape the solution and for the client to determine prioritization and timing.Of course in reality, you’re often involved in shaping the solution too - but it’s crucial to ensure that you’re not skipping over the step of clearly defining the size and shape of the opportunity before getting to the solution.  Example: Working with an ecommerce site to define an SEO strategy part of my recommendation involved investing in content strategy to drive links, traffic and conversions - but before even getting into the shape of the solution, i.e. how we would invest in content it’s important to articulate what the opportunity is.  By looking at relevant competitors we can estimate the potential traffic and revenue opportunity:    By showing what’s possible, clients are able to feel more invested in designing the solution with you, rather than just being told what to do.This can also be uncomfortable! There are many situations where quantifying the exact opportunity is difficult, requires estimation or requires a different approach (like we saw with the Gartner surveys).But consider the alternative - the alternative is recommending something to the client… because we say so?This isn’t necessarily wrong - there’s value in expert opinion - but in my experience clients deeply appreciate you clearly separating out expert opinion and judgment from evidence-based analysis.As David Maister says in the Trusted Advisor - the best approach is:  A good process for the advisor to follow is:      Give them their options    Give them an education about their options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth)    Give them a recommendation    Let them choose  This stance essentially allows you as the consultant to own the diagnosis and quantification of the opportunity and then collaboratively with the client to shape the solution and prioritization.Let’s look at the problem togetherTaking a collaborative stance with your client is powerful. There are many aspects of consulting that are almost combative by nature - like pointing out problems the client has (that the client was complicit in creating!).As we saw in the chapter Optimism as an Operating System, walking into a client with a critical eye can create a distance between you and the client.Instead you want to create a kind of shoulder-to-shoulder stance with the client, facing towards the problems together. This creates a much safer, judgment free way to look at the problems (and opportunities) facing the client.In fact, for senior executives - sometimes you really can’t give them advice - they’re too type-A and overly confident. The only way to convince them is to help them see the problem in a new light - to see things as you see them.This idea is demonstrated beautifully by Timothy Gallway in The Inner Game of Tennis where he recounts teaching a senior executive how to improve their backhand:  One day in the summer of 1971 when I was teaching a group of men at John Gardiner’s Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, a businessman realized how much more power and control he got on his backhand when his racket was taken back below the level of the ball. He was so enthusiastic about his “new” stroke that he rushed to tell his friend Jack about it as if some kind of miracle had occurred. Jack, who considered his erratic backhand one of the major problems of his life, came rushing up to me during the lunch hour, exclaiming, “I’ve always had a terrible backhand. Maybe you can help me.”  I asked, “What’s so terrible about your backhand?”  “I take my racket back too high on my backswing.”  “How do you know?”  “Because at least five different pros have told me so. I just haven’t been able to correct it.”  For a brief moment I was aware of the absurdity of the situation. Here was a business executive who controlled large commercial enterprises of great complexity asking me for help as if he had no control over his own right arm. Why wouldn’t it be possible, I wondered, to give him the simple reply, “Sure, I can help you. L-o-w-e-r y-o-u-r r-a-c-k-e-t!”  But complaints such as Jack’s are common among people of all levels of intelligence and proficiency. Besides, it was clear that at least five other pros had told him to lower his racket without much effect. What was keeping him from doing it? I wondered.  I asked Jack to take a few swings on the patio where we were standing. His backswing started back very low, but then, sure enough, just before swinging forward it lifted to the level of his shoulder and swung down into the imagined ball. The five pros were right. I asked him to swing several more times without making any comment. “Isn’t that better?” he asked. “I tried to keep it low.” But each time just before swinging forward, his racket lifted; it was obvious that had he been hitting an actual ball, the underspin imparted by the downward swing would have caused it to sail out. “Your backhand is all right,” I said reassuringly. “It’s just going through some changes. Why don’t you take a closer look at it.” We walked over to a large windowpane and there I asked him to swing again while watching his reflection. He did so, again taking his characteristic hitch at the back of his swing, but this time he was astounded. “Hey, I really do take my racket back high! It goes up above my shoulder!” There was no judgment in his voice; he was just reporting with amazement what his eyes had seen.  What surprised me was Jack’s surprise. Hadn’t he said that five pros had told him his racket was too high? I was certain that if I had told him the same thing after his first swing, he would have replied, “Yes, I know.” But what was now clear was that he didn’t really know, since no one is ever surprised at seeing something they already know. Despite all those lessons, he had never directly experienced his racket going back high. His mind had been so absorbed in the process of judgment and trying to change this “bad” stroke that he had never perceived the stroke itself.  Looking in the glass which mirrored his stroke as it was, Jack was able to keep his racket low quite effortlessly as he swung again. “That feels entirely different than any backhand I’ve ever swung,” he declared. By now he was swinging up and through the ball over and over again. Interestingly, he wasn’t congratulating himself for doing it right; he was simply absorbed in how different it felt.  After lunch I threw Jack a few balls and he was able to remember how the stroke felt and to repeat the action. This time he just felt where his racket was going, letting his sense of feel replace the visual image offered by the mirror. It was a new experience for him. Soon he was consistently hitting topspin backhands into the court with an effortlessness that made it appear this was his natural swing. In ten minutes he was feeling “in the groove,” and he paused to express his gratitude. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you’ve done for me. I’ve learned more in ten minutes from you than in twenty hours of lessons I’ve taken on my backhand.” I could feel something inside me begin to puff up as it absorbed these “good” words. At the same time, I didn’t know quite how to handle this lavish compliment, and found myself hemming and hawing, trying to come up with an appropriately modest reply. Then, for a moment, my mind turned off and I realized that I hadn’t given Jack a single instruction on his backhand! “But what did I teach you?” I asked. He was quiet for a full half-minute, trying to remember what I had told him. Finally he said, “I can’t remember your telling me anything! You were just there watching, and you got me watching myself closer than I ever had before. Instead of seeing what was wrong with my backhand, I just started observing, and improvement seemed to happen on its own. I’m not sure why, but I certainly learned a lot in a short period of time.” He had learned, but had he been “taught”?This is about tennis (is it?) but equally applies to consulting! I find in my own work that senior executives are often blocked by some inability to see what’s actually going on - and that telling them is useless! Instead you need to help them see it for themselves.Because of their distance from the day to day work, senior executives are especially prone to replacing some version of reality with a compressed narrative. And when this compressed narrative is wrong in some key way you need to return to first principles to show them (not tell them!).Much like we saw with the example of the Gartner surveys - helping clients see with fresh eyes what’s really going is powerful and can be profoundly useful before you even begin suggesting solutions.Understanding the problem in all of its emotional and political complexityOnce you adopt this collaborative stance with the client you begin to see that the problems as you thought you understood them, are not in fact the full picture.Your sense of “what’s going on” with a client is intermediated by your point of contact and it turns out that your client is an unreliable narrator. Remember - best case they have problems they’ve been unable to solve on their own, worst case they were actively responsible for creating the problems in the first place!So it’s no wonder that clients often down-play, mis-represent and mask the full emotional and political complexity of what’s going on. Especially when you first start working together and haven’t yet earned their trust.But for you to do your job it’s crucial that you get a full picture of what’s really going on. And further, clients deeply appreciate a consultant that can listen and observe closely enough to see what’s really going on.As David Maister says in The Consultant’s Role:  “It can be unsettling to find that the client is primarily interested in having his or her problem understood, in all its emotional and political complexity, as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.”What this is saying is that you need to earn the client’s trust in order to be effective at your job. This isn’t at all obvious! When a client comes to you asking for a “content strategy” or support “hiring a VP marketing” it all seems so straightforward, rational and well defined. But as you unpack the layers of the onion you begin to realize why it’s been so hard for the client to help themselves. And that’s when the emotional and political complexity of the problem starts to come into view.Developing a sensitivity to the emotional and political context of client problems requires an active listening and sensing instinct on behalf of the consultant - to use your own lived experience inside the client’s organization as a way to sense what the inner work life is like inside your client’s business. As Ruth Orenstein says in her book Multidimensional Executive Coaching:  For the time he/she is present, the consultant becomes part of the multidimensional system, both influencing it and being influenced by it. To do the work of executive coach- ing, then, the consultant must be able to tolerate, and ultimately make use of, entering a highly complex place-a place that is occupied by neither the individual nor the organization alone but, because of their convergence, both the individual and the organization together; a place that contains both the exigencies of working life and the impulses of the psyche; and a place that engages and, in turn, is engaged by the consultant’s own intrapsychic material. In addition, if the work is done effectively, it requires that the consultant be both involved enough in the dynamics so as to experience their impact and detached enough so as to analyze what is transpiring. These demands make imperative the use of oneself as tool.Remember: when clients first come to you, your first instinct might be to dismiss the problem as “easily solved”. But you need to hold space to truly consider that the thing that seems easy is, in this particular situation, with this particular client actually not at all easy. And that’s when the work begins.The Next Most Useful ThingThis all builds up to my personal consulting mantra: always work on the next most useful thing.This mantra helps remind me that consulting isn’t about being right, it’s about being useful.As a consultant - it’s crucial that you’re generating momentum, that clients can feel a sense of progress in your work. A consultant is typically an expensive investment and without a sense of progress or momentum your engagement will stall out.Importantly however, a sense of progress and momentum doesn’t have to come from the official SOW or project plan. Actual progress is one thing - but a sense of progress is just that - it’s about your client feeling like things are moving forward.In fact, depending on the project and the client - moving at the expected pace can be too slow! Even after agreeing on a scope, project plan and set of next steps, moving as fast as you said you would can be disappointing to the client.Remember - building a great client relationship is about trust. And doing the minimum doesn’t build trust. So it’s important to demonstrate to the client that you’re willing to do the extra work, to go a little further, to do the unexpected.This doesn’t require a ton of extra time but it does require some deliberate effort and sensitivity - to think about the client’s reality - the meetings, projects, pressures they’re facing right now - and think about how you can proactively support them.You could re-draw the diagram from up above as follows:Whether your client is facing an important decision, or preparing for a board meeting or working through a bunch of menial tasks - whatever it is there’s typically a way for you to help out in some small way. And in doing so the client feels a sense of momentum and builds a sense of trust between you.What’s the next most useful thing?It’s not about ignoring the SOW or the project plan but it’s about recognizing that there’s value in giving your client a sense of momentum.  Example: I worked with a B2B saas client a few years ago - they were a small startup looking to raise their series B round and we engaged to create a content strategy.  On this project I made a mistake and despite the fact the client didn’t have any in-house editorial resources I took their request at face value and we structured the project around a 6-week content strategy.  I delivered what I think is good quality work with a deeply researched and evidence-based 66-page strategy for producing content and…. Nothing happened? They were happy enough with the work product but it didn’t lead to any material change in their strategy or an ongoing consulting relationship.  In hindsight the key mistake here was not asking myself enough what the next most useful thing was. I think if I’d been more honest about what would add value and show momentum for the client it would have been either a) condensed one or two slide summary of the content opportunity for their fundraising deck and/or b) supporting their VP marketing recruitment effort.  Perhaps I should have done both. Either way - it turns out that what the client wanted wasn’t really what the client needed and this mismatch led to a fairly unproductive engagement.Recognizing that clients are unreliable narrators when it comes to scoping projects and defining timelines allows for a more philosophical view of value when it comes to consulting.Is a 6 week strategy project really the most useful thing the client needs right now? What happens at that point when we have the strategy defined - then what? By seeking more context, clarity and insight into momentum we can more easily work on things that the client will truly appreciate, not just provide things the client asked for.A Conclusion About OwlsThere’s an internet meme about giving advice that I love. It’s an image that shows you how to draw an owl:Too much bad consulting work looks like either step 1 or step 2. Either you’re telling the client “draw some circles” and the client is frustrated the advice is too basic and high level. Or you’re telling the client to “draw the rest of the fucking owl” and are ignoring the detailed reality of the situation and the limitations of teams, resources and capabilities.Or worse, the client asked you for help drawing owls but what they’re really doing is painting a woodland scene…Think about this image next time a client comes to you for help drawing owls - your first response shouldn’t be “Oh, that’s easy, first you draw some circles”, it should be “Show me how your owls look today. What do you think is holding you back from drawing better owls? And why is drawing owls important to you right now?”Remember - it’s about adopting a collaborative, trusted stance with clients. And that might require resisting your initial urge to give advice. Instead you need to listen to the full emotional and political situation and then work with the client to re-examine reality in new and surprising ways.Always work on the next most useful thing. And that doesn’t always involve doing what the client asked for."

  "content": "New year, new me, new clients am I right?I don’t work with many clients. In 2023 I worked with six clients. In 2022 it was four.This is partly because I have the luxury to choose and partly because I really like to work with clients in a deep, transformational way1.One of my active clients I’ve been working with for 7 years.Right now though I have some capacity for new clients and I’m trying to be thoughtful about not just attracting clients, but attracting the the right kind of clients.How do I find the next 7-year client?Well, if you don’t ask you don’t get right so here’s some brands and projects I’ve love to work with in 2024:Quick links:  Figma  Replit  Remarkable  Stripe  LinkedIn  Perplexity &amp; AI Search  Weird Indie Collabs  Academic &amp; Educational Collabs  More Strategic Advisor RolesFigmaFigma has changed my life. I spend all day long staring at my glowing rectangle of a computer screen but what is on that screen has meaningfully changed in the last few years. Even though I’m not a designer and don’t get hired for “design” work I spend 50%+ of my time in Figma.A canvas is just a beautiful and useful place to think.I’ve talked before about making strategy maps, beautiful charts and more in Figma. I even ran a cohort based course around non-design uses of Figma called Figma Thinkers.Much like the underlying javascript technology of ajax ushered in Gmail and with it a whole paradigm of “apps in the browser” I believe that the technical advances in making the open canvas work will usher in a whole new paradigm of canvas-based apps.Relevant: infinitecanvas.toolsI’m such a fanboy that I’d work with Figma on anything ha. But here’s a few ideas:  Exploring non-design / non-product use cases for Figma. What if we built a new team inside Figma that aimed at winning over McKinsey and all the big consulting firms to use Figma day to day. What would that look like? How would the product need to evolve? How might we open up a whole new segment of the market?  How can we do more interesting, adventurous editorial projects? Inspired by Stripe press and Figma essays. How might we explore a wider, more creative range of publishing and editorial projects to show off what Figma can do?  From an SEO perspective, Canva has done a masterful job with templates, tools and content designed for SEO and gets… checks notes… about 3400% more Google traffic2. What would the Figma equivalent SEO play be here?ReplitTinkering with the web is a foundational part of my identity. I’ve called this digital bricolage before. I’m not a real developer, just like I’m not a real designer and yet I build things on Replit all the time!I’m a huge advocate for tools that lower the bar to entry for more users and help people expand what they think is possible. Couple that with a deep frustration at how most developer tools on board users (see: why can’t I code inside my browser) and Replit is a dream client.I recently built a little bookmarklet and app for a client using Replit that gave an x-ray vision overlay on their website with a bunch of custom analysis and stats - took me a few hours to prototype and opened up a bunch of interesting conversations! I love that kind of thing.So how might we work together? Some ideas:  Replit has a real search problem - if you search for examples and templates on Google you get stuck in a list of Replit pages that look the same, with many of them being low-quality. There’s a crawling, architecture and internal linking strategy here to dramatically improve the ability for people to find high quality Replit examples and templates.  You can import Github repos directly into Replit which feels like magic when it works! Except it’s very hard to know if it’s going to work ahead of time. I think there are opportunities here around better messaging / workflows / community standards to help people better understand whether a github repo can be imported directly into Replit, and if so how to do it.  The education play on Replit seems very successful with the 100 days of code in particular. I’d love to expand this idea into potentially more cohort-based models of building projects. Less “learn to code” and more “build something interesting, together”.RemarkableI bought a Remarkable tablet last year and it really changed my daily knowledge work. It’s a beautiful product that feels like a joy to use. It’s also directly led to me reading a lot more PDFs and academic papers - it’s such a perfect form factor for loading up a PDF and reading/annotating - deep focus work away from my other screens.At the same time - it’s clearly still early in the “e-ink screen” world, it feels kind of like when I got my first Sonos product 12 years ago. Such a leap forward ahead of everything else but also kind of clunky, we’re still working our way through what this technology can and should do and how we interact with it.Some things I’d love to work with Remarkable on:  They’ve done a great job with Instagram content - it’s polished, engaging and clearly converts for them. But remarkable.com is somewhat neglected in terms of content. There’s a big opportunity to really take the web seriously and build an evergreen content library - both to show off the product and to do a better job on the product education and support side.  When I’m working on my laptop I keep my Remarkable right next to me but this “passive second screen” use case is completely unexplored. I’d love to work through how you could enable new modes of working - what could you use your e-ink second screen for? There are all kinds of kindle jailbreak and raspberry pi examples of second-screens and displays that I think the Remarkable would be perfect for.  While generally the Remarkable UX and interactions are well thought through there are a variety of things that would be fun to prototype and play with for example double-tap the power button to take a screenshot, or an “send this” action when you select a region.  I’d love to explore different workflows and innovations around web &lt;–&gt; remarkable workflows for saving, reading, sharing content between the browser and the device. There’s lots of unexplored uses here.Oh, and when are we getting a Google Calendar integration? :)StripeI use Stripe almost every day. Both as a consumer and as someone who sells things on the internet. Stripe is an astonishing service that has no right to be as polished, playful and fun to work with as they are.And they have beautiful web-design! and they have a writing culture! and they have a whole experimental content/publishing approach!Ever since they talked about increasing the GDP of the internet and linked to Craig Mod in their annual letter I’ve been a huge fan. (I think there’s actually a real economic argument to be said that blogging raises the GDP of the internet btw.)How might we work together? Some thoughts:  Stripe press is incredible in terms of their brand but still fairly limited in scope. I’d love to get involved with Stripe and see what their focus on writing culture can do for the web.  I’d love to work with Stripe on training around their internal culture of writing. I don’t have any insight into how this writing is organized, shared or produced today but I’d love to work with the team on internal strategy and knowledge sharing. I’m kind of a geek when it comes to executive communication…LinkedInActually, LinkedIn is a great social network. People hate on the quality of the feed at LinkedIn but I believe this is largely because most people never deliberately built their feed, they just connected with random co-workers and industry friends over the last 15 years…Once you take the time to intentionally craft your feed it’s perhaps the most wholesome social feed on the web right now (?!)Beyond just the feed though, LinkedIn is a social product that actually has a core utility! The value of a professional profile actually has value, distinct from other social sites.I’d love to work with LinkedIn on:  Positioning LinkedIn as a personal learning environment. Not just “LinkedIn learning” though that’s part of it - but actually everything on LinkedIn culminates in learning - the feed, your network, education content and more. There’s so much unexplored possibility around social learning environments, just-in-time learning, credentialing and more. I’ve got a deck pre-built about this if you want to take a peek just ping me :)Perplexity &amp; AI-searchThere are a bunch of people like Perplexity, Metaphor and Elicit building AI-powered search engines. I’m not an expert in the AI technology but after working in search for almost 20 years there are a bunch of things that I think we can learn about how people search and searcher behavior that would be relatively easy to build and would help turn these from niche, single-purpose search engines into more complete general-purpose search engines.Maybe:  User research studies that focus on people’s searching behavior. Since we’re building something new this isn’t straightforward but I still believe that grounding in user research is useful and would uncover some smaller things that might change user adoption and retention.  Benchmarking the user experience of key user journeys against other search tools to better understand where the product excels. One of the defining ideas is that teams don’t know what they’ve built - as Matt Webb says with AI we’re in a capability overhang. Or to say another way, we’re in a product marketing overhang - we don’t even know how good the product is that we’ve built!  Brand exploration and user messaging to figure out how to educate and convert people into a new daily behavior. Based on the above I think there are some fun and interesting ways that we might build awareness and adoption of the new tools.More Weird Indie CollabsI learned how to use Figma because of a client collaboration with Toby Shorin. I learned to love brand positioning because of working with Elan Miller.I’ve realized that working with other indie consultants isn’t always the most lucrative way to do consulting - but these projects are the best learning opportunities and periods of personal growth. So, more please.Some ideas:  Right now I’m collaborating with some tech-heads who are pitching AI-content solutions where I can be the marketing and strategy lead in the room. That’s fun.  I’ve been tangentially involved in a bunch of M&amp;A projects over the last few years but I’d love to get more formally integrated into M&amp;A workflows, private equity valuation projects and more.  I’ve thought a lot about executive dashboards and built a monthly business review packet for one of my clients. If you’re working in this area holler at me, let’s share notes!  Same for executive offsites - why are they so broken? If you’re working on fixing these give me a shout and let’s work together.  For established, perhaps older, consultants a collaboration around knowledge sharing, publishing and blogging would be super fun.  More broadly - if you’re coming at strategy from the creative and brand perspective I can make a great bridge to the more data-driven and technical end of marketing and business strategy.Academic and Educational CollabsI’ve been really digging the practice of teaching and would love to get involved in more academic and educational work. I’ve done a small amount of this in the past - I taught a class at a business school and I was an advisor for an ITP summer program.So I guess management theory and innovation are the two areas I get most excited about?If you’re in academia (in the broadest sense) and follow my writing maybe drop me a note. I’d love to chat.More Strategic Advisor RolesFor bigger clients I typically play a marketing or growth role. The work itself is varied but I typically get a seat at the table because of my content and marketing background.For smaller and mid-size clients though, I’m increasingly finding myself playing a generalist role - shaping strategy and supporting executives in all kinds of functions (including a small amount of executive coaching too). I talked about that a bit here: The roadmap is not the territory. I’d like to do more of this work - supporting business growth from first principles and looking at improving management performance more generally.Challenge #1 I suppose is how to describe this work. The best I’ve come up with is “strategic advisor”…Let’s manifest at least one or two of these in 2024! If you want to get in touch click here.            Last time I calculated it, the average length for a client retainer was over 2 years. &#8617;              See screenshot &#8617;      "

I even ran a cohort based course around non-design uses of Figma called Figma Thinkers.Much like the underlying javascript technology of ajax ushered in Gmail and with it a whole paradigm of “apps in the browser” I believe that the technical advances in making the open canvas work will usher in a whole new paradigm of canvas-based apps.Relevant: infinitecanvas.toolsI’m such a fanboy that I’d work with Figma on anything ha. But here’s a few ideas:  Exploring non-design / non-product use cases for Figma. What if we built a new team inside Figma that aimed at winning over McKinsey and all the big consulting firms to use Figma day to day. What would that look like? How would the product need to evolve? How might we open up a whole new segment of the market?  How can we do more interesting, adventurous editorial projects? Inspired by Stripe press and Figma essays. How might we explore a wider, more creative range of publishing and editorial projects to show off what Figma can do?  From an SEO perspective, Canva has done a masterful job with templates, tools and content designed for SEO and gets… checks notes… about 3400% more Google traffic2. What would the Figma equivalent SEO play be here?ReplitTinkering with the web is a foundational part of my identity. I’ve called this digital bricolage before. I’m not a real developer, just like I’m not a real designer and yet I build things on Replit all the time!I’m a huge advocate for tools that lower the bar to entry for more users and help people expand what they think is possible. Couple that with a deep frustration at how most developer tools on board users (see: why can’t I code inside my browser) and Replit is a dream client.I recently built a little bookmarklet and app for a client using Replit that gave an x-ray vision overlay on their website with a bunch of custom analysis and stats - took me a few hours to prototype and opened up a bunch of interesting conversations! I love that kind of thing.So how might we work together? Some ideas:  Replit has a real search problem - if you search for examples and templates on Google you get stuck in a list of Replit pages that look the same, with many of them being low-quality. There’s a crawling, architecture and internal linking strategy here to dramatically improve the ability for people to find high quality Replit examples and templates.  You can import Github repos directly into Replit which feels like magic when it works! Except it’s very hard to know if it’s going to work ahead of time. I think there are opportunities here around better messaging / workflows / community standards to help people better understand whether a github repo can be imported directly into Replit, and if so how to do it.  The education play on Replit seems very successful with the 100 days of code in particular. I’d love to expand this idea into potentially more cohort-based models of building projects. Less “learn to code” and more “build something interesting, together”.RemarkableI bought a Remarkable tablet last year and it really changed my daily knowledge work. It’s a beautiful product that feels like a joy to use. It’s also directly led to me reading a lot more PDFs and academic papers - it’s such a perfect form factor for loading up a PDF and reading/annotating - deep focus work away from my other screens.At the same time - it’s clearly still early in the “e-ink screen” world, it feels kind of like when I got my first Sonos product 12 years ago. Such a leap forward ahead of everything else but also kind of clunky, we’re still working our way through what this technology can and should do and how we interact with it.Some things I’d love to work with Remarkable on:  They’ve done a great job with Instagram content - it’s polished, engaging and clearly converts for them. But remarkable.com is somewhat neglected in terms of content. There’s a big opportunity to really take the web seriously and build an evergreen content library - both to show off the product and to do a better job on the product education and support side.  When I’m working on my laptop I keep my Remarkable right next to me but this “passive second screen” use case is completely unexplored. I’d love to work through how you could enable new modes of working - what could you use your e-ink second screen for? There are all kinds of kindle jailbreak and raspberry pi examples of second-screens and displays that I think the Remarkable would be perfect for.  While generally the Remarkable UX and interactions are well thought through there are a variety of things that would be fun to prototype and play with for example double-tap the power button to take a screenshot, or an “send this” action when you select a region.  I’d love to explore different workflows and innovations around web &lt;–&gt; remarkable workflows for saving, reading, sharing content between the browser and the device. There’s lots of unexplored uses here.Oh, and when are we getting a Google Calendar integration? :)StripeI use Stripe almost every day. Both as a consumer and as someone who sells things on the internet. Stripe is an astonishing service that has no right to be as polished, playful and fun to work with as they are.And they have beautiful web-design! and they have a writing culture! and they have a whole experimental content/publishing approach!Ever since they talked about increasing the GDP of the internet and linked to Craig Mod in their annual letter I’ve been a huge fan. (I think there’s actually a real economic argument to be said that blogging raises the GDP of the internet btw.)How might we work together? Some thoughts:  Stripe press is incredible in terms of their brand but still fairly limited in scope. I’d love to get involved with Stripe and see what their focus on writing culture can do for the web.  I’d love to work with Stripe on training around their internal culture of writing. I don’t have any insight into how this writing is organized, shared or produced today but I’d love to work with the team on internal strategy and knowledge sharing. I’m kind of a geek when it comes to executive communication…LinkedInActually, LinkedIn is a great social network. People hate on the quality of the feed at LinkedIn but I believe this is largely because most people never deliberately built their feed, they just connected with random co-workers and industry friends over the last 15 years…Once you take the time to intentionally craft your feed it’s perhaps the most wholesome social feed on the web right now (?!)Beyond just the feed though, LinkedIn is a social product that actually has a core utility! The value of a professional profile actually has value, distinct from other social sites.I’d love to work with LinkedIn on:  Positioning LinkedIn as a personal learning environment. Not just “LinkedIn learning” though that’s part of it - but actually everything on LinkedIn culminates in learning - the feed, your network, education content and more. There’s so much unexplored possibility around social learning environments, just-in-time learning, credentialing and more. I’ve got a deck pre-built about this if you want to take a peek just ping me :)Perplexity &amp; AI-searchThere are a bunch of people like Perplexity, Metaphor and Elicit building AI-powered search engines. I’m not an expert in the AI technology but after working in search for almost 20 years there are a bunch of things that I think we can learn about how people search and searcher behavior that would be relatively easy to build and would help turn these from niche, single-purpose search engines into more complete general-purpose search engines.Maybe:  User research studies that focus on people’s searching behavior. Since we’re building something new this isn’t straightforward but I still believe that grounding in user research is useful and would uncover some smaller things that might change user adoption and retention.  Benchmarking the user experience of key user journeys against other search tools to better understand where the product excels. One of the defining ideas is that teams don’t know what they’ve built - as Matt Webb says with AI we’re in a capability overhang. Or to say another way, we’re in a product marketing overhang - we don’t even know how good the product is that we’ve built!  Brand exploration and user messaging to figure out how to educate and convert people into a new daily behavior. Based on the above I think there are some fun and interesting ways that we might build awareness and adoption of the new tools.More Weird Indie CollabsI learned how to use Figma because of a client collaboration with Toby Shorin. I learned to love brand positioning because of working with Elan Miller.I’ve realized that working with other indie consultants isn’t always the most lucrative way to do consulting - but these projects are the best learning opportunities and periods of personal growth. So, more please.Some ideas:  Right now I’m collaborating with some tech-heads who are pitching AI-content solutions where I can be the marketing and strategy lead in the room. That’s fun.  I’ve been tangentially involved in a bunch of M&amp;A projects over the last few years but I’d love to get more formally integrated into M&amp;A workflows, private equity valuation projects and more.  I’ve thought a lot about executive dashboards and built a monthly business review packet for one of my clients. If you’re working in this area holler at me, let’s share notes!  Same for executive offsites - why are they so broken? If you’re working on fixing these give me a shout and let’s work together.  For established, perhaps older, consultants a collaboration around knowledge sharing, publishing and blogging would be super fun.  More broadly - if you’re coming at strategy from the creative and brand perspective I can make a great bridge to the more data-driven and technical end of marketing and business strategy.Academic and Educational CollabsI’ve been really digging the practice of teaching and would love to get involved in more academic and educational work. I’ve done a small amount of this in the past - I taught a class at a business school and I was an advisor for an ITP summer program.So I guess management theory and innovation are the two areas I get most excited about?If you’re in academia (in the broadest sense) and follow my writing maybe drop me a note. I’d love to chat.More Strategic Advisor RolesFor bigger clients I typically play a marketing or growth role. The work itself is varied but I typically get a seat at the table because of my content and marketing background.For smaller and mid-size clients though, I’m increasingly finding myself playing a generalist role - shaping strategy and supporting executives in all kinds of functions (including a small amount of executive coaching too). I talked about that a bit here: The roadmap is not the territory. I’d like to do more of this work - supporting business growth from first principles and looking at improving management performance more generally.Challenge #1 I suppose is how to describe this work. The best I’ve come up with is “strategic advisor”…Let’s manifest at least one or two of these in 2024! If you want to get in touch click here.            Last time I calculated it, the average length for a client retainer was over 2 years. &#8617;              See screenshot &#8617;      "

  "content": "  “I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I’ve never been able to believe it. I don’t believe a rose WOULD be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.” ― L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Green GablesThe identity and labels you create for yourself as an independent consultant are tricky things. They’re not fixed but they sure do seem to carry some mystical weight. If we go around calling ourselves a UX designer one week and a storyteller in residence another week we’re going to suffer a kind of internal angst, or vertigo.When you have a job - your work label is given to you. Anyone can go see it on your LinkedIn page. “Product manager at Salesforce” or “Head of marketing at Etsy”. These labels are very clearly defined - and they mean something - “product manager” and “head of marketing” are legible and transferable between companies, they convey a shared sense of knowledge, expertise, seniority, salary and more.But when you step out on your own….LinkedIn doesn’t know what to do with you. Freelance strategy consultant employed by tomcritchlow.com…? Sure I guess?You might think this is a surface level problem - haha ok so LinkedIn doesn’t know how to deal with me. No biggie - LinkedIn is garbage anyway right.Except… the power of labels isn’t for others, the power of labels is for ourselves.Good labels give us the power to charge money, they give us confidence and energy. While bad labels can cause psychic anguish and self-sabotage.When you step out on your own into the world of independence, you’re suddenly responsible for your own label. For the self employed indie consultant swapping out identities can be as easy as changing the words on LinkedIn or rewriting your landing page.We’re simply not designed to switch our sense of identity so quickly or easily.In part 1 we’ll look at choosing the labels you use - dealing with the disorienting and uncomfortable questions about who you believe you are, who we want to become and how much you believe your own bullshit.In part 2 we’ll look at evolving and growing your sense of identity over time. Untethered from the world of pay rises, promotions and job titles, how do you create a sense of progress and personal growth?Part 1: Narrative AircoverA defining characteristic of the internet is to rewrite the rules of permission and institutions. This means that the way that identities are formed is changing too - how they are generated, shaped, validated and sustained all change because of the internet.The old world is full of gatekeepers to impress - but the networked age radically changes the game. It changes who gets to give permission and which parts require permission at all. Now, in 2024, we’re firmly in an era of permissionless identities.It’s no longer sufficient to rely on existing authority and institutions to create your labels - instead you need to create and tend to your own labels.For independents you feel this acutely when you first step out on your own - how do you describe the work that you do? How do you describe who you are? But no matter the labels and language you choose, to begin with it’s going to be made up. You don’t yet have enough of a track record, client history or confidence in who you are or who you will become to state anything with certainty.And in fact, this is a good thing! This leaping into the chaos of the unknown is one of the things that attracts weirdos, fools and generalists towards the independent lifestyle in the first place.The first year or two of independent consulting are typically a swirling mixture of trying on labels for size. Are you a product manager? Consultant? Freelancer? Innovation designer? Copywriter? Strategist? Brand strategist? No-code guru?These labels are going to swirl around you and I’m going to tell you that it’s ok to thrash around for a while - try labels on for size. Create new ones! Discard old ones! Come back to the ones you discarded before!As Herminia Ibarra says in the wonderful book Working Identity, the dangerous thing is to clutch too tightly to a singular introspective idea of “Who am I?”. Instead Herminia suggests we should adopt a more iterative, playful idea of “who could I become?”:  “How do we move forward and reinvent ourselves when our very selves have been so shaken? For starters, we must reframe the questions, abandoning the conventional career-advice queries—“Who am I?”—in favor of more open-ended alternatives—“Among the many possible selves that I might become, which is most intriguing to me now? Which is easiest to test?” Getting started depends on whether we are looking to find our one true self or whether, instead, we are trying to test and evaluate possible alternatives.”This process of becoming is entirely natural and in fact can be generative - leading to new ideas.But this thrashing and cycling through labels can be psychologically exhausting too. For those around us - and for ourselves - how do we maintain some sense of stability in the chaos?The answer is not to hide our consulting identity, but to protect it and give it some shelter while it’s still emerging. Enter narrative aircover.Narrative AircoverWhen I quit my last job almost 10 years ago, I didn’t know that I’d end up doing so much consulting work, or that I’d end up identifying so strongly with the label “independent consultant”.It turns out when I quit my job I was actually trying to build an art startup with my partner: Fiercely Curious. You can see from this email exchange that Fiercely Curious is the primary label and identity I’m using:It took about 9-12 months of juggling some consulting work and building an art startup to realize that:  Consulting pays far better than building an art startup (who knew!)  I actually enjoyed consultingThis was about the time that I decided to go “all in” on consulting, to start using that label and identify that way. Importantly by that stage I’d had 4-5 solid consulting projects and had some confidence that “consultant” meant something more than just “unemployed freelancer”.This was all kind of accidental but in hindsight incredibly valuable - the ability to lean on Fiercely Curious as a project with some kind of substance allowed me to show up in the world, to have conversations with people, to network, to tell people what I was up to.All while I muddled my way through becoming a consultant.That’s why I call this “narrative aircover” because it provides shelter and protection to the emerging identity while it’s still incredibly fragile.In my case, my narrative aircover was in the shape of an art business. In your case it could be an online food magazine, or a meetup event series, or a podcast.The key thing for narrative aircover is that it’s expansive, passionate and unblocked.I think the following characteristics are most useful for narrative aircover to provide you value in the early stages of starting a consulting business:1. Expansive to grow your surface areaWhile our consulting identity is small and fragile it can be easy to close up - to adopt a stance of safety. “Who am I to talk about being a consultant, I barely have any clients!” or “What do I have to say on LinkedIn, I’m not even working right now!”.But growing and nurturing your network is essential to building a long term sustainable indie consulting career so in the early days it’s important to do things that open you up - open you up to opportunities, connections, conversations and clients. So you need to pick something that’s expansive - something that opens you up to invite connection.  Example: When Vicky Gu went out as an independent brand and content strategist - she leaned on narrative aircover of her online food magazine Currant. There, she is able to describe herself as a “managing editor” (see how easy it is to award yourself labels in a permissionless world!).  Currant is expansive - it is a way in for Vicky to have conversations with chefs, restaurant owners, writers, designers and all sorts of other folks in the making of a digital publication. But it’s also expansive in the sense that through sharing editorial pieces about food, she can reach new audiences.The idea that your narrative aircover is something that can invite people to lean in allows you to easily have new conversations with new people and expand your surface area. Whether it’s an email list, event series or non-profit.You want a project that opens doors - something that gives you an excuse to be public, visible and interesting. Building something that is a permission tool to give yourself permission to reach out to people, to meet people for coffee, to connect and to build your network.2. Passionate to show off your vibesAs we saw in Strange Attraction, the value of your network comes from all kinds of weird and wonderful places - it isn’t always the people you would expect. And as we saw in Rejecting Specialization to secure senior level projects you need to expose your vibes.So it’s important to have something interesting that you can talk about. My art startup is a great conversation starter - a lot of people are interested in art and culture. Just like lots of people are interested in Vicky’s food magazine.Launching a narrative aircover project that is inherently aligned with your passions will help ensure that people are paying attention, leaning in and taking your meetings.3. Unblocked so it’s within your controlFinally, you want your narrative aircover project to be more under your own control than consulting work. One of the primary problems to solve is that you likely don’t currently have a lot of consulting work to rely on or talk about - you’re dependent on clients to move things forward.So you want your narrative aircover project to be alive by default - not blocked and relying on others to move forward but something that you can move forward under your own steam. Even a humble blog can fit the requirements here - free to publish as and when you want without any kind of gatekeepers or dependencies on others.In summary - indie consultants are creatures of momentum and narrative aircover is how you get started. It’s about creating activation energy in your network to start making something happen - because without that you’re going to just sit there and worry about finding clients.Narrative aircover isn’t about hiding our consulting identity - it’s about not leaning on it too hard during the early days when it’s most fragile and still evolving.Narrative aircover provides you meaning, labels, safety and permission to engage with people while you’re figuring things out during the first year or so of your journey.Part 2: Compound NarrativeEventually, at some point down the road you will successfully manage to generate revenue, find clients and build a consulting practice that works - your next problem is figuring out how to make it sustainable.Understandably - so much of your focus in the first few years of setting up your practice is on consistently generating clients. That is after all the most important thing you need. One client after another. Line em up.But at some point you can end up stuck - feeling like every client is simply another spin of the hamster wheel. Trapped in your own constraints of client work you’re feeling like there’s a never-ending series of client projects on the treadmill. A feeling that every client is starting from zero again.The never-ending treadmill of client workOne of the biggest downsides of consulting is that there’s nothing passive about the revenue - nothing compounds. To pay rent each month you have to keep generating clients.This is why, once you reach some stability with consistently generating clients and revenue, many indie consultants begin to think about “scaling themselves” - either in the form of hiring staff or in building “passive income” products.This reflex isn’t bad per se but it’s important to recognize that they are avoiding the real problem. They are avoidance of dealing with the root issue of actually enjoying your consulting work. Of finding a way to value and enjoy client work over long periods of time.Some of the things we’ve talked about in the book can help you enjoy your work: shifting to strategic clients helps keep the work interesting and focusing on being impactful helps the work feel meaningful. But at some point it can start to feel like a grind.The problem is that outside of the constraints and norms of full time work, a defined career and job progression - there’s no simple measure for professional advancement.No one is paying for training, no one is sending you to conferences. No one is giving you a promotion or a new job title.So you have to find your own personal growth plan - a way to both find intrinsic meaning in growth and development and in externally visible progress towards being “more senior” and able to move upwards inside client organizations. Otherwise you’ll stagnate, your earnings will plateau and your public image will stall out.Fitting every client into a narrative frameThe trick here is to use each client as a compound build on the last one, not simply another go around the treadmill.  Example: In my own work - in year 2, after finding some routine in generating clients and steady work - a friend asked for advice on going out on their own, so I wrote up a blog post with some thoughts. That blog post generated a few more blog posts about the practice of independent consulting and before you know it I was writing this book (a project that would creatively sustain me with compound narrative for the next 6+ years!)  The trick is that every new client isn’t simply a chance to do the same thing but it’s a chance to deepen my perspective and experience on the practice of independent consulting. Every client can teach you something.  Now I gleefully look forward to new clients because I know they can become stories and examples for my book project.I call this idea compound narrative. You need some way to feel like every client builds on the last one - that you’re left starting from somewhere new, not starting from the same place every time.Then - the trick is to view every single client, no matter how “boring” or “routine” or “straightforward” on the surface - as being part of that compound narrative. What insights or evidence can you gather towards your questions through this client project?Niko Canner calls this “mastery of a larger game”:  The medium to do this larger work was in writing. In my prior chapter as a founder, building Katzenbach Partners, I’d never given myself much space to write, because that had never felt as important to my goals as the work of entrepreneurial leadership, rainmaking and advising clients. I needed to change that, and to recognize that writing would be my vehicle for reaching toward greater mastery of a larger game. Writing wasn’t in service of building an audience or building a business. Writing as a learning practice was an end in itself.This might seem straightforward but the subtle trick is choosing a narrative frame that you’re actually interested in. For example, if you’re a digital PR consultant - the obvious learning frame for your work would be to learn about the practice of digital PR. Sure, this makes sense - except perhaps you’re not really interested in the idea of “digital PR” - it’s too broad and doesn’t have any kind of hook to it.The trick is to find a frame that lights up your curiosity - perhaps something like “how digital PR is evolving as new social platforms emerge” or “how companies measure the effectiveness of digital PR” or “why digital PR doesn’t get a seat at the executive table”.Finding the Right Learning QuestionsNotice that these narrative frames are all open ended questions that possess a measure of specific curiosity. These narrative frames can be far more interesting by virtue of being more specific.Questions are powerful tools for shaping your thinking and perspective. Finding good questions can sustain and nourish your curiosity and help you feel alive. They’re the antidote to burnout and stagnation.But how do you find good questions?A great place to start is to write down a list of questions that you don’t know the answer to. Questions that might not even have an easy answer. Questions that you can explore over an extended period of time.The community Huddlecraft calls these learning questions:  It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.  Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.  Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.And they have this lovely 2x2 framework with examples of learning questions:This 2x2 framework feels right - if you write down 10 ideas for learning questions, you’ll be able to plot them (subjectively) on this 2x2 graph. It’s not that every single learning question needs to be impossible to answer and open ended, but those questions are going to be the ones with the most potential to nourish and sustain your practice for the longest.  Example: Behzod Sirjani is an independent consultant with a deep background in user research. To sustain his practice he has been researching and publishing OAE - a learning question around organizations as ecosystems:      “Organizations as Ecosystems” is a research and writing project about the ways that organizations sense, react, learn, and change. Some outputs of this project will be regular essays and a corresponding set of readings and references.    This is a perfect open ended and impossible to fully answer. It’s easy to see how this question could sustain years of client work, where each client is an opportunity to explore and deepen your understanding of the question of how companies sense, react, learn and change.Finding the right set of learning questions is incredibly powerful because it turns your consulting practice into a sustainable practice. It enables you to stay in the work for long multi-year periods. Because you have to stay in the work - if you’re an independent consultant there’s no one to do the work for you - no employees, no colleagues to lean on. So you have to stay in the work.Compound Thinking &amp; PublishingThe magical thing about finding questions you’re interested in and pursuing them for a while is that you end up with interesting things to say.As you deepen your understanding of the questions you’re interested in you find that these projects turn into generative and useful objects  For example, here’s John V Willshire back in 2015 talking about the famous “Smithery Projects” that he embarks on each year:      “Ah, the famous annual Smithery projects. Well, famous might be pushing it, let’s go with ‘the thing that we do at the start of each year’. 2012 was about Making, 2013 was about Media, and 2014 was about Playing With Ideas, which in hindsight remained gloriously ill-defined but gave rise to August’s Culture Matrix malarkey, so we’ll let it off.”    One of those projects eventually turned into a delightful foundational framework and approach called Zenko mapping that is core to how Smithery operates.It’s part of why publishing is such a rich pursuit for indie consultants - it’s a culmination and focus on the act of accumulated insights. Turning your compound narrative into a published artefact is incredibly powerful - it positions you as an expert, builds an audience and is incredibly satisfying!There’s a rich vein of self-publishing by indie consultants:  The ux consultant writing a book about UX design.  The designer writing a book about design.  The security consultant publishing emergency extraction guides.  The ethnographic researcher publishing the fieldguide to ethnographic research.  The indie consultant publishing the book about independent consulting (coming soon!)But it doesn’t have to be a book - publishing in all its forms can be an email newsletter, it can be a podcast, it can be a zine, it can be a research report.Any of these can work and in fact the ongoing nature of something like a podcast can help sustain an interest by becoming a vehicle not for promoting, but for learning! For continually being interested in the work you’re doing.And if you do it all correctly, the sky’s the limit as April Dunford, author of Obviously Awesome, will testify:  “Getting the book out was absolutely transformational to the business. Like, that’s what took me from, this is a good business that pays me more than what my salary was in house, you know, yay me, consultant, to holy man. I didn’t even think it was possible to make this kind of money and work with this kind of clients and do this amazing stuff. And, yeah, the book was a game changer.”In SummaryThe challenge of managing your own identity - free from any constraints and expectations of full time work - can be a surprising challenge. Realizing that you can be whoever you want to be comes with a sense of being untethered. Navigating that narrative journey requires anchoring ourselves to things - whether it’s narrative aircover of a self-directed project or the compound narrative of learning questions.And eventually, once you find a generative set of questions to explore, it can sustain an independent consulting practice for years - helping you generate interesting clients, enjoy every new client and build a sense of personal growth and progression."

Now, in 2024, we’re firmly in an era of permissionless identities.It’s no longer sufficient to rely on existing authority and institutions to create your labels - instead you need to create and tend to your own labels.For independents you feel this acutely when you first step out on your own - how do you describe the work that you do? How do you describe who you are? But no matter the labels and language you choose, to begin with it’s going to be made up. You don’t yet have enough of a track record, client history or confidence in who you are or who you will become to state anything with certainty.And in fact, this is a good thing! This leaping into the chaos of the unknown is one of the things that attracts weirdos, fools and generalists towards the independent lifestyle in the first place.The first year or two of independent consulting are typically a swirling mixture of trying on labels for size. Are you a product manager? Consultant? Freelancer? Innovation designer? Copywriter? Strategist? Brand strategist? No-code guru?These labels are going to swirl around you and I’m going to tell you that it’s ok to thrash around for a while - try labels on for size. Create new ones! Discard old ones! Come back to the ones you discarded before!As Herminia Ibarra says in the wonderful book Working Identity, the dangerous thing is to clutch too tightly to a singular introspective idea of “Who am I?”. Instead Herminia suggests we should adopt a more iterative, playful idea of “who could I become?”:  “How do we move forward and reinvent ourselves when our very selves have been so shaken? For starters, we must reframe the questions, abandoning the conventional career-advice queries—“Who am I?”—in favor of more open-ended alternatives—“Among the many possible selves that I might become, which is most intriguing to me now? Which is easiest to test?” Getting started depends on whether we are looking to find our one true self or whether, instead, we are trying to test and evaluate possible alternatives.”This process of becoming is entirely natural and in fact can be generative - leading to new ideas.But this thrashing and cycling through labels can be psychologically exhausting too. For those around us - and for ourselves - how do we maintain some sense of stability in the chaos?The answer is not to hide our consulting identity, but to protect it and give it some shelter while it’s still emerging. Enter narrative aircover.Narrative AircoverWhen I quit my last job almost 10 years ago, I didn’t know that I’d end up doing so much consulting work, or that I’d end up identifying so strongly with the label “independent consultant”.It turns out when I quit my job I was actually trying to build an art startup with my partner: Fiercely Curious. You can see from this email exchange that Fiercely Curious is the primary label and identity I’m using:It took about 9-12 months of juggling some consulting work and building an art startup to realize that:  Consulting pays far better than building an art startup (who knew!)  I actually enjoyed consultingThis was about the time that I decided to go “all in” on consulting, to start using that label and identify that way. Importantly by that stage I’d had 4-5 solid consulting projects and had some confidence that “consultant” meant something more than just “unemployed freelancer”.This was all kind of accidental but in hindsight incredibly valuable - the ability to lean on Fiercely Curious as a project with some kind of substance allowed me to show up in the world, to have conversations with people, to network, to tell people what I was up to.All while I muddled my way through becoming a consultant.That’s why I call this “narrative aircover” because it provides shelter and protection to the emerging identity while it’s still incredibly fragile.In my case, my narrative aircover was in the shape of an art business. In your case it could be an online food magazine, or a meetup event series, or a podcast.The key thing for narrative aircover is that it’s expansive, passionate and unblocked.I think the following characteristics are most useful for narrative aircover to provide you value in the early stages of starting a consulting business:1. Expansive to grow your surface areaWhile our consulting identity is small and fragile it can be easy to close up - to adopt a stance of safety. “Who am I to talk about being a consultant, I barely have any clients!” or “What do I have to say on LinkedIn, I’m not even working right now!”.But growing and nurturing your network is essential to building a long term sustainable indie consulting career so in the early days it’s important to do things that open you up - open you up to opportunities, connections, conversations and clients. So you need to pick something that’s expansive - something that opens you up to invite connection.  Example: When Vicky Gu went out as an independent brand and content strategist - she leaned on narrative aircover of her online food magazine Currant. There, she is able to describe herself as a “managing editor” (see how easy it is to award yourself labels in a permissionless world!).  Currant is expansive - it is a way in for Vicky to have conversations with chefs, restaurant owners, writers, designers and all sorts of other folks in the making of a digital publication. But it’s also expansive in the sense that through sharing editorial pieces about food, she can reach new audiences.The idea that your narrative aircover is something that can invite people to lean in allows you to easily have new conversations with new people and expand your surface area. Whether it’s an email list, event series or non-profit.You want a project that opens doors - something that gives you an excuse to be public, visible and interesting. Building something that is a permission tool to give yourself permission to reach out to people, to meet people for coffee, to connect and to build your network.2. Passionate to show off your vibesAs we saw in Strange Attraction, the value of your network comes from all kinds of weird and wonderful places - it isn’t always the people you would expect. And as we saw in Rejecting Specialization to secure senior level projects you need to expose your vibes.So it’s important to have something interesting that you can talk about. My art startup is a great conversation starter - a lot of people are interested in art and culture. Just like lots of people are interested in Vicky’s food magazine.Launching a narrative aircover project that is inherently aligned with your passions will help ensure that people are paying attention, leaning in and taking your meetings.3. Unblocked so it’s within your controlFinally, you want your narrative aircover project to be more under your own control than consulting work. One of the primary problems to solve is that you likely don’t currently have a lot of consulting work to rely on or talk about - you’re dependent on clients to move things forward.So you want your narrative aircover project to be alive by default - not blocked and relying on others to move forward but something that you can move forward under your own steam. Even a humble blog can fit the requirements here - free to publish as and when you want without any kind of gatekeepers or dependencies on others.In summary - indie consultants are creatures of momentum and narrative aircover is how you get started. It’s about creating activation energy in your network to start making something happen - because without that you’re going to just sit there and worry about finding clients.Narrative aircover isn’t about hiding our consulting identity - it’s about not leaning on it too hard during the early days when it’s most fragile and still evolving.Narrative aircover provides you meaning, labels, safety and permission to engage with people while you’re figuring things out during the first year or so of your journey.Part 2: Compound NarrativeEventually, at some point down the road you will successfully manage to generate revenue, find clients and build a consulting practice that works - your next problem is figuring out how to make it sustainable.Understandably - so much of your focus in the first few years of setting up your practice is on consistently generating clients. That is after all the most important thing you need. One client after another. Line em up.But at some point you can end up stuck - feeling like every client is simply another spin of the hamster wheel. Trapped in your own constraints of client work you’re feeling like there’s a never-ending series of client projects on the treadmill. A feeling that every client is starting from zero again.The never-ending treadmill of client workOne of the biggest downsides of consulting is that there’s nothing passive about the revenue - nothing compounds. To pay rent each month you have to keep generating clients.This is why, once you reach some stability with consistently generating clients and revenue, many indie consultants begin to think about “scaling themselves” - either in the form of hiring staff or in building “passive income” products.This reflex isn’t bad per se but it’s important to recognize that they are avoiding the real problem. They are avoidance of dealing with the root issue of actually enjoying your consulting work. Of finding a way to value and enjoy client work over long periods of time.Some of the things we’ve talked about in the book can help you enjoy your work: shifting to strategic clients helps keep the work interesting and focusing on being impactful helps the work feel meaningful. But at some point it can start to feel like a grind.The problem is that outside of the constraints and norms of full time work, a defined career and job progression - there’s no simple measure for professional advancement.No one is paying for training, no one is sending you to conferences. No one is giving you a promotion or a new job title.So you have to find your own personal growth plan - a way to both find intrinsic meaning in growth and development and in externally visible progress towards being “more senior” and able to move upwards inside client organizations. Otherwise you’ll stagnate, your earnings will plateau and your public image will stall out.Fitting every client into a narrative frameThe trick here is to use each client as a compound build on the last one, not simply another go around the treadmill.  Example: In my own work - in year 2, after finding some routine in generating clients and steady work - a friend asked for advice on going out on their own, so I wrote up a blog post with some thoughts. That blog post generated a few more blog posts about the practice of independent consulting and before you know it I was writing this book (a project that would creatively sustain me with compound narrative for the next 6+ years!)  The trick is that every new client isn’t simply a chance to do the same thing but it’s a chance to deepen my perspective and experience on the practice of independent consulting. Every client can teach you something.  Now I gleefully look forward to new clients because I know they can become stories and examples for my book project.I call this idea compound narrative. You need some way to feel like every client builds on the last one - that you’re left starting from somewhere new, not starting from the same place every time.Then - the trick is to view every single client, no matter how “boring” or “routine” or “straightforward” on the surface - as being part of that compound narrative. What insights or evidence can you gather towards your questions through this client project?Niko Canner calls this “mastery of a larger game”:  The medium to do this larger work was in writing. In my prior chapter as a founder, building Katzenbach Partners, I’d never given myself much space to write, because that had never felt as important to my goals as the work of entrepreneurial leadership, rainmaking and advising clients. I needed to change that, and to recognize that writing would be my vehicle for reaching toward greater mastery of a larger game. Writing wasn’t in service of building an audience or building a business. Writing as a learning practice was an end in itself.This might seem straightforward but the subtle trick is choosing a narrative frame that you’re actually interested in. For example, if you’re a digital PR consultant - the obvious learning frame for your work would be to learn about the practice of digital PR. Sure, this makes sense - except perhaps you’re not really interested in the idea of “digital PR” - it’s too broad and doesn’t have any kind of hook to it.The trick is to find a frame that lights up your curiosity - perhaps something like “how digital PR is evolving as new social platforms emerge” or “how companies measure the effectiveness of digital PR” or “why digital PR doesn’t get a seat at the executive table”.Finding the Right Learning QuestionsNotice that these narrative frames are all open ended questions that possess a measure of specific curiosity. These narrative frames can be far more interesting by virtue of being more specific.Questions are powerful tools for shaping your thinking and perspective. Finding good questions can sustain and nourish your curiosity and help you feel alive. They’re the antidote to burnout and stagnation.But how do you find good questions?A great place to start is to write down a list of questions that you don’t know the answer to. Questions that might not even have an easy answer. Questions that you can explore over an extended period of time.The community Huddlecraft calls these learning questions:  It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.  Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.  Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.And they have this lovely 2x2 framework with examples of learning questions:This 2x2 framework feels right - if you write down 10 ideas for learning questions, you’ll be able to plot them (subjectively) on this 2x2 graph. It’s not that every single learning question needs to be impossible to answer and open ended, but those questions are going to be the ones with the most potential to nourish and sustain your practice for the longest.  Example: Behzod Sirjani is an independent consultant with a deep background in user research. To sustain his practice he has been researching and publishing OAE - a learning question around organizations as ecosystems:      “Organizations as Ecosystems” is a research and writing project about the ways that organizations sense, react, learn, and change. Some outputs of this project will be regular essays and a corresponding set of readings and references.    This is a perfect open ended and impossible to fully answer. It’s easy to see how this question could sustain years of client work, where each client is an opportunity to explore and deepen your understanding of the question of how companies sense, react, learn and change.Finding the right set of learning questions is incredibly powerful because it turns your consulting practice into a sustainable practice. It enables you to stay in the work for long multi-year periods. Because you have to stay in the work - if you’re an independent consultant there’s no one to do the work for you - no employees, no colleagues to lean on. So you have to stay in the work.Compound Thinking &amp; PublishingThe magical thing about finding questions you’re interested in and pursuing them for a while is that you end up with interesting things to say.As you deepen your understanding of the questions you’re interested in you find that these projects turn into generative and useful objects  For example, here’s John V Willshire back in 2015 talking about the famous “Smithery Projects” that he embarks on each year:      “Ah, the famous annual Smithery projects. Well, famous might be pushing it, let’s go with ‘the thing that we do at the start of each year’. 2012 was about Making, 2013 was about Media, and 2014 was about Playing With Ideas, which in hindsight remained gloriously ill-defined but gave rise to August’s Culture Matrix malarkey, so we’ll let it off.”    One of those projects eventually turned into a delightful foundational framework and approach called Zenko mapping that is core to how Smithery operates.It’s part of why publishing is such a rich pursuit for indie consultants - it’s a culmination and focus on the act of accumulated insights. Turning your compound narrative into a published artefact is incredibly powerful - it positions you as an expert, builds an audience and is incredibly satisfying!There’s a rich vein of self-publishing by indie consultants:  The ux consultant writing a book about UX design.  The designer writing a book about design.  The security consultant publishing emergency extraction guides.  The ethnographic researcher publishing the fieldguide to ethnographic research.  The indie consultant publishing the book about independent consulting (coming soon!)But it doesn’t have to be a book - publishing in all its forms can be an email newsletter, it can be a podcast, it can be a zine, it can be a research report.Any of these can work and in fact the ongoing nature of something like a podcast can help sustain an interest by becoming a vehicle not for promoting, but for learning! For continually being interested in the work you’re doing.And if you do it all correctly, the sky’s the limit as April Dunford, author of Obviously Awesome, will testify:  “Getting the book out was absolutely transformational to the business. Like, that’s what took me from, this is a good business that pays me more than what my salary was in house, you know, yay me, consultant, to holy man. I didn’t even think it was possible to make this kind of money and work with this kind of clients and do this amazing stuff. And, yeah, the book was a game changer.”In SummaryThe challenge of managing your own identity - free from any constraints and expectations of full time work - can be a surprising challenge. Realizing that you can be whoever you want to be comes with a sense of being untethered. Navigating that narrative journey requires anchoring ourselves to things - whether it’s narrative aircover of a self-directed project or the compound narrative of learning questions.And eventually, once you find a generative set of questions to explore, it can sustain an independent consulting practice for years - helping you generate interesting clients, enjoy every new client and build a sense of personal growth and progression."

Every year I write a set of reflections about this strange and magical journey.This year’s post is… about two months late. Symptomatic of how overwhelmed I’ve been this year I guess. Since having kids, deadlines are a mere illusion, shadows of their former selves.I ended last year’s recap with this note:  I’m going to pull myself out of this identity slump by sheer force of will. Watch me (tune in next year to see how that goes).Oof. What a year it’s been. I think I’ve finally crawled out of this slump but it took me ALL. DAMN. YEAR. For most of this year, something was blocked. I felt stuck, paralyzed and confused.First, the Highlights  Roxy is 7.5 and full of a burning desire for independence and autonomy (where could she have gotten that from I wonder?!). This has at times made our home an us vs them environment of parents vs Roxy. Thankfully we’re finding a much better balance in the second half of the year. Roxy is now a committed Taylor Swift fan and I love it.  Indy is now 4 and really coming into his own with personality, pizazz and a deep love of Ninjago lego.  Instead of putting the kids in summer camp we took an extended European vacation as a family, taking almost 7 weeks off. This is the first year that both kids are officially in school schedules and it’s weird to start to think about every year having a specific “shape” - of summer holidays, school dates and more.  I took three week-long work trips and.. this was too much. The projects were exactly the kind of projects I want to work on, but I’ve got to find clients in NYC (or at least the east coast!) that I can work with in this capacity.The NumbersThis year was a strange narrative violation. It wasn’t my best year for consulting (that was 2018) and it wasn’t my best year for the SEO MBA (that was 2022) but combined, this year nudged into my best revenue year ever (blue = consulting, red = SEO MBA):This year the SEO MBA is back in balance with my consulting revenue, about ~30% of my consulting income.This chart does mask some sharp peaks and troughs though - almost all of my consulting revenue this year came in Q1! Which means that while the whole year is very healthy, the last 6+ months have been much more quiet.Stuck to UnstuckI tried therapy, I tried an executive coach, I tried joining random slack communities. I tried yelling, I tried crying. I tried sitting at my computer for days, hours, weeks at a time. I tried hiding.I tried a bunch of things - figma thinkers cohort, SEO MBA live cohort, joining random discord groups. This kind of flailing did not feel like play. But perhaps it should have?Acknowledging that I was going through a transition and leaning into the playful nature of it could have helped:In Working Identity, Herminia Ibarra argues that the process of transitioning from one career to another is both usually and necessarily messy and disordered, more like playing than like planning. During a transition, it can seem like nothing is happening, or too much is happening, or somehow both simultaneously. Often someone in the middle of a transition experiences a lot of pressure, both internally and from kin, to stop fucking around and get on with it. But that may be profoundly the wrong advice.Mandy Brown https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/premature-closureThis is much harder to do though when you feel the slightest money stress and despite the strong year I felt some anxiety around that in the second half of the year as consulting dried up. This happens every single time I get quiet with consulting… You would think after 9 years I would have learned to trust the process by now, but with all the tech industry layoffs and tough economic climate it wasn’t hard to feel some economic anxiety.Ultimately, the most powerful thing was working with my executive coach (thank you Sunil). It really helped remind me why I was working on the various projects I was - how they fit together and why they’re important to me.I’d also like to give a massive shoutout to Paul Millerd for both having me on his podcast to talk about being stuck as well as being an absolute massive champion and energizing for getting my book finished (more on the book in a second).Would I call myself unstuck now? I think I would. Launching the NEW MBA I think was the final puzzle piece that allowed me to feel free to move and play again.The central question for 2024 is how to keep hold of this feeling. I’m not going to get stuck again.I just f*(&amp;^)ing LOVE consultingOne of the things that emerged out of my work with my executive coach was a reminder that I really, truly love consulting work.There are many indie consultants that like the lifestyle and freedoms it affords, but don’t actually love the client work itself - but I’ve worked so hard over the last 9 years to both attract the right kinds of clients and to hone my approach to working with clients that client work energizes me and lights me up.More please, I love it.At the root of this is the idea of consulting being a conversation with clients. Niko Canner articulates this beautifully in his piece:I’d gone back to consulting because I loved doing my work in conversation: both the real-time exchange of ideas and the way that writing down my thoughts for clients created the opportunity for a slower, more extended form of dialogue. Those were practices to deepen every day.@humanenterprise https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decadeAt one point I think I felt like perhaps my consulting chapter was waning or winding down as I focused on courses and whatnot. But this conversation with clients is too deeply rooted. I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years. You have no idea how exciting that is to write.What did consulting work look like this year? Here’s a few vignettes:  After reading Cedric’s blog post series on becoming more data driven and in particular the Amazon Weekly Business Review - I worked with a long term client to create a Monthly Business Review (MBR) packet that has a TON of charts and data in it. The CEO now carries it around with him at all times - scribbling notes in the margins and I love it.  As mentioned last year - most of my work is now P&amp;L first which really means that the primary context I’m considering work through is a resource-constrained and financial perspective. This is a continuation of the idea that’s powered my entire consulting career: how to do effective consulting work. Good ideas are worthless if you can’t get them done.  Working with Directive Consulting on their branding and positioning was very rewarding - Garrett the CEO is an amazing operator with a deep understanding of his own P&amp;L and this positioning work wasn’t just words, it was designed to change the whole delivery cycle from marketing and sales through to operations.  I dabbled with some executive coaching - but the biggest realization here is that I’m too much of a consultant to be a pure coach - I want to be like a performance coach, working directly with individuals and executive teams on management performance. My ideal client would be running a management team weekly meeting - getting more operational than coaching typically allows.  Surprisingly, I’ve ended up integrating design work into my consulting offering. I’ve ended up designing new page templates, product experiences, landing pages, keynote presentations and more. Design isn’t the main thing people are paying me for but I’m starting to take design more seriously as as thing that I can deliver as part of a strategic project.Looking ahead to the new year - obviously AI is going to dominate the conversation. I’m involved in a few very interesting client projects around AI and it feels like clients are finally starting to realize they need to get started, you can’t hang around waiting for others to figure it out for you…From SEO MBA -&gt; NEW MBAAt the start of the year I ran a live cohort for the SEO MBA. It was…. fine? The people that went through the experience absolutely loved it, but the cohort was smaller than I wanted it to be and I overloaded the schedule so it was quite exhausting to run.Partly because of this and partly because of a general desire to broaden and expand the ideas in the SEO MBA I went into hibernation mode. Out of that emerged a new idea - it’s an evolution of the SEO MBA brand, but designed for a much broader audience:The NEW MBA is already deeply rewarding and generative. The ability to sit with ideas around business, management and leadership that I’ve been playing around with on the SEO MBA is very exciting. The aspiration here is to reach a much bigger audience with the ideas - and to align the writing and courses more directly with my consulting work.There aren’t (yet) any courses and classes on the NEW MBA but all of that is coming this year so watch this space. Just like my consulting, I think I can commit to the NEW MBA idea for the next 20 years.This project is live, but actually is in a kind of “soft launch” state - because there’s something I’ve gotta do first….A Winter of Word Craft: The book is coming!My close friend Brian created a little book of collected testimonials and blurbs for my book and handed it to me on my 40th birthday party. It floored me. I cried. You are the best Brian. And thank you to everyone who included a blurb. The overwhelming support for the book is a real driving force and I love you all.The good news is that the book is coming! I’ve been jamming with fellow indie consultant Tim Casasola on the outline and structure for the book and I think I’m finally arrived at somewhere I’m happy with. But/and I’ve realized that actually getting this book over the finishing line is going to require a period of focused effort and dedication.My good friend Toby wrote an incredibly moving and lovely December note where he talked about naming seasons and intention setting:Winter is upon us now, and I don't have a name for this season yet. But December and winter for me is always dream season, so perhaps I will call it that. Winter is for reflecting and clarifying, and dreams are for knowing and for inventing—for we know in part, and we prophesy in part. I have recommended to you the benefits of dreaming, and of naming your seasons. I hope that you join me in the great experiment.@buttondown https://buttondown.email/tobyshorin/archive/reflections-on-2023/So I’m dedicating this season to the Winter of Word Craft.To say that another way - on the first day of Spring I will be done with the book.Thanks to Paul Millerd and Erica Heinz for countless self-publishing questions AND emotional support and encouragement. They’ve both put incredible and beautiful self-published books out in the world and I’m grateful for both of them.A Very Bad No-good Year for BloggingWriting has given me everything. It’s been a deeply, deeply generative and powerful force. And yet when I became stuck my writing stopped.I haven’t written anything of substance since April.Blog you fool! Writing is the way through! Find the strength to publish!A failed year with very little writing. Some of the highlights:  Writing, riffs and relationships - an ode to using writing as a way to connect with others  The magic of small databases - I’m still baffled at how hard it is to maintain a library of things using computers….  Input metrics for SEO - Over on the SEO MBA.  Reframing what it means to be an executive - at the NEW MBA  The Capital of ideas - at the NEW MBAIt’s important to keep pushing this year. To write DESPITE the resistance. To write THROUGH the resistance. Blogging is the way out. After all, a blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox.The NetworkIt’s always the people. I feel deeply grateful and thankful for my friends who have shown up in spades this year. Twitter, Discord groups, DMs, coffee shops, cocktails, walks and phone calls. Many of my best friends are indie weirdos like me and I love it.Much love to you all.So, What’s Next Kid?Well, this is year 10. Buckle up.I simply refuse to be stuck in 2024 like I was in 2022 and 2023. Not through determination and force of will but through forgiveness, play and lightness. As Italo Calvino once said: “One should be light like a bird and not like a feather.”I’ve used the metaphor of a road trip before to describe being an indie consultant. I’ve always imagined it like driving around in a car. But perhaps after almost 10 years it’s time to expand my ways of being in the world. Moving through the world not on wheels but on wings.Writing this in the depths of winter it’s time to manifest the owl as my spirit animal for the year - wise and quirky, beautiful and alive. Like a snow owl gliding through time and space with temerity and grace.Hoo hoo motherfuckers.🦉🦉"

This happens every single time I get quiet with consulting… You would think after 9 years I would have learned to trust the process by now, but with all the tech industry layoffs and tough economic climate it wasn’t hard to feel some economic anxiety.Ultimately, the most powerful thing was working with my executive coach (thank you Sunil). It really helped remind me why I was working on the various projects I was - how they fit together and why they’re important to me.I’d also like to give a massive shoutout to Paul Millerd for both having me on his podcast to talk about being stuck as well as being an absolute massive champion and energizing for getting my book finished (more on the book in a second).Would I call myself unstuck now? I think I would. Launching the NEW MBA I think was the final puzzle piece that allowed me to feel free to move and play again.The central question for 2024 is how to keep hold of this feeling. I’m not going to get stuck again.I just f*(&amp;^)ing LOVE consultingOne of the things that emerged out of my work with my executive coach was a reminder that I really, truly love consulting work.There are many indie consultants that like the lifestyle and freedoms it affords, but don’t actually love the client work itself - but I’ve worked so hard over the last 9 years to both attract the right kinds of clients and to hone my approach to working with clients that client work energizes me and lights me up.More please, I love it.At the root of this is the idea of consulting being a conversation with clients. Niko Canner articulates this beautifully in his piece:I’d gone back to consulting because I loved doing my work in conversation: both the real-time exchange of ideas and the way that writing down my thoughts for clients created the opportunity for a slower, more extended form of dialogue. Those were practices to deepen every day.@humanenterprise https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decadeAt one point I think I felt like perhaps my consulting chapter was waning or winding down as I focused on courses and whatnot. But this conversation with clients is too deeply rooted. I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years. You have no idea how exciting that is to write.What did consulting work look like this year? Here’s a few vignettes:  After reading Cedric’s blog post series on becoming more data driven and in particular the Amazon Weekly Business Review - I worked with a long term client to create a Monthly Business Review (MBR) packet that has a TON of charts and data in it. The CEO now carries it around with him at all times - scribbling notes in the margins and I love it.  As mentioned last year - most of my work is now P&amp;L first which really means that the primary context I’m considering work through is a resource-constrained and financial perspective. This is a continuation of the idea that’s powered my entire consulting career: how to do effective consulting work. Good ideas are worthless if you can’t get them done.  Working with Directive Consulting on their branding and positioning was very rewarding - Garrett the CEO is an amazing operator with a deep understanding of his own P&amp;L and this positioning work wasn’t just words, it was designed to change the whole delivery cycle from marketing and sales through to operations.  I dabbled with some executive coaching - but the biggest realization here is that I’m too much of a consultant to be a pure coach - I want to be like a performance coach, working directly with individuals and executive teams on management performance. My ideal client would be running a management team weekly meeting - getting more operational than coaching typically allows.  Surprisingly, I’ve ended up integrating design work into my consulting offering. I’ve ended up designing new page templates, product experiences, landing pages, keynote presentations and more. Design isn’t the main thing people are paying me for but I’m starting to take design more seriously as as thing that I can deliver as part of a strategic project.Looking ahead to the new year - obviously AI is going to dominate the conversation. I’m involved in a few very interesting client projects around AI and it feels like clients are finally starting to realize they need to get started, you can’t hang around waiting for others to figure it out for you…From SEO MBA -&gt; NEW MBAAt the start of the year I ran a live cohort for the SEO MBA. It was…. fine? The people that went through the experience absolutely loved it, but the cohort was smaller than I wanted it to be and I overloaded the schedule so it was quite exhausting to run.Partly because of this and partly because of a general desire to broaden and expand the ideas in the SEO MBA I went into hibernation mode. Out of that emerged a new idea - it’s an evolution of the SEO MBA brand, but designed for a much broader audience:The NEW MBA is already deeply rewarding and generative. The ability to sit with ideas around business, management and leadership that I’ve been playing around with on the SEO MBA is very exciting. The aspiration here is to reach a much bigger audience with the ideas - and to align the writing and courses more directly with my consulting work.There aren’t (yet) any courses and classes on the NEW MBA but all of that is coming this year so watch this space. Just like my consulting, I think I can commit to the NEW MBA idea for the next 20 years.This project is live, but actually is in a kind of “soft launch” state - because there’s something I’ve gotta do first….A Winter of Word Craft: The book is coming!My close friend Brian created a little book of collected testimonials and blurbs for my book and handed it to me on my 40th birthday party. It floored me. I cried. You are the best Brian. And thank you to everyone who included a blurb. The overwhelming support for the book is a real driving force and I love you all.The good news is that the book is coming! I’ve been jamming with fellow indie consultant Tim Casasola on the outline and structure for the book and I think I’m finally arrived at somewhere I’m happy with. But/and I’ve realized that actually getting this book over the finishing line is going to require a period of focused effort and dedication.My good friend Toby wrote an incredibly moving and lovely December note where he talked about naming seasons and intention setting:Winter is upon us now, and I don't have a name for this season yet. But December and winter for me is always dream season, so perhaps I will call it that. Winter is for reflecting and clarifying, and dreams are for knowing and for inventing—for we know in part, and we prophesy in part. I have recommended to you the benefits of dreaming, and of naming your seasons. I hope that you join me in the great experiment.@buttondown https://buttondown.email/tobyshorin/archive/reflections-on-2023/So I’m dedicating this season to the Winter of Word Craft.To say that another way - on the first day of Spring I will be done with the book.Thanks to Paul Millerd and Erica Heinz for countless self-publishing questions AND emotional support and encouragement. They’ve both put incredible and beautiful self-published books out in the world and I’m grateful for both of them.A Very Bad No-good Year for BloggingWriting has given me everything. It’s been a deeply, deeply generative and powerful force. And yet when I became stuck my writing stopped.I haven’t written anything of substance since April.Blog you fool! Writing is the way through! Find the strength to publish!A failed year with very little writing. Some of the highlights:  Writing, riffs and relationships - an ode to using writing as a way to connect with others  The magic of small databases - I’m still baffled at how hard it is to maintain a library of things using computers….  Input metrics for SEO - Over on the SEO MBA.  Reframing what it means to be an executive - at the NEW MBA  The Capital of ideas - at the NEW MBAIt’s important to keep pushing this year. To write DESPITE the resistance. To write THROUGH the resistance. Blogging is the way out. After all, a blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox.The NetworkIt’s always the people. I feel deeply grateful and thankful for my friends who have shown up in spades this year. Twitter, Discord groups, DMs, coffee shops, cocktails, walks and phone calls. Many of my best friends are indie weirdos like me and I love it.Much love to you all.So, What’s Next Kid?Well, this is year 10. Buckle up.I simply refuse to be stuck in 2024 like I was in 2022 and 2023. Not through determination and force of will but through forgiveness, play and lightness. As Italo Calvino once said: “One should be light like a bird and not like a feather.”I’ve used the metaphor of a road trip before to describe being an indie consultant. I’ve always imagined it like driving around in a car. But perhaps after almost 10 years it’s time to expand my ways of being in the world. Moving through the world not on wheels but on wings.Writing this in the depths of winter it’s time to manifest the owl as my spirit animal for the year - wise and quirky, beautiful and alive. Like a snow owl gliding through time and space with temerity and grace.Hoo hoo motherfuckers.🦉🦉"

  "title": "The roadmap is not the territory",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2023/04/18/roadmap-territory/",
  "date": "April 18, 2023",
  "content": "Most of my consulting work connects to “marketing strategy” in some way - clients come wanting to talk about growing their business. But the funny thing about growth and marketing is that each component is like a thread that, once pulled, unravels the whole spool.  Struggling with distribution? How’s your analytics?  Struggling with SEO? How’s your product?  Struggling with content? How’s your narrative?  Struggling with margin? How’s your sales?Every question seems to open up an interconnected mess.It’s why I start every consulting engagement asking 1,000 questions. I’m trying to understand the context of the client environment, trying to see how all the threads are interconnected.So it’s been fun recently to do a few projects that look like a “full business review” where I work with a team on strategy, but explicitly putting the whole business on the table as context. I’m thinking about scaling up and formalizing this offering so I’ve been musing about where the value is for these sessions, what clients want, and where clients get stuck.The format for these business review sessions today is:  Initial exploratory kickoff to align on objectives  Prep work to get up to speed with the quirks of the business and review existing data and documents  Two-day workshop (in a remote world typically spread over 3-4 sessions)  A summary presentation that captures the key ideas from the workshopGiven my background, these sessions typically focus on growth, but the nice thing about expanding the frame from a typical consulting engagement is we deliberately put everything on the table: operations, process, people, funding etc. It’s useful to try and look at the business as a whole so that when we get into the weeds with a particular problem (which we inevitably do) we can keep the broader business context in mind.It’s surprising how useful this broader company context is - I get the impression that most leadership teams really don’t give themselves permission to zoom in and out from macro to micro in the same session - and this causes a lot of bad decision making.The tension of course with these workshop sessions is that “strategy” and “roadmaps” are abstract concepts and not particularly useful. What can you accomplish in a two-day session that has real value for a client?In early conversations with clients we usually settle on “prioritization” as the tangible output, as in - we’ll come out of the two days with “a prioritized roadmap” or a “set of strategic priorities”.The reality is a bit messier than that - the value from the session typically ends up a mixture of: clarity around the big picture, combined with a few very specific key breakthroughs which unlock immediate action on projects.This could be a useful insight around content distribution, or an insight about SEO success, or an insight around job responsibility for an upcoming hire, or a key way to separate or integrate different business units.In the end, prioritization isn’t really the useful thing.The roadmap is not the territoryPrioritization sounds concrete but isn’t actually that interesting. Clients already know roughly what to do - and have a prioritized roadmap already. So what’s the problem?The challenge facing the client is typically some underlying feeling that what is currently on the roadmap today won’t prepare them correctly for tomorrow’s future. There’s a belief that they need to do things differently or do new things to prepare for the changing future.The real challenge typically ends up being “how do we invest in doing NEW things, given our existing prioritized roadmap?”. The client is looking at an existing roadmap, trying to add brand new things to it and so imagines that a new version of the prioritized roadmap is what they need.But the challenge runs deeper. Doing things differently, or doing brand new things is HARD for organizations. You have to fight against existing roadmaps, existing biases, existing goals, existing routines and processes.And, crucially, it’s not about a well defined roadmap where we understand the variables. It’s impossible to forecast and roadmap a future for activities we don’t understand yet. How much will it cost to invest in this new channel? How fast can we see success doing this new thing? How many pieces of content can we create using the new process?Management is prediction, and it’s hard to predict new thingsBusinesses are learning engines and management is prediction. Cedric Chin is writing a wonderful series right now on management as prediction and what that actually means in practice:What does it mean to be data driven in business? Most people think being data driven means looking at charts on a daily basis. Or they attempt to use data in their orgs, and then fall into one of the many traps that come with the territory. How do you actually get good at using data for your operations? And how do you build the mindset and the organisational capabilities necessary to do it?@commoncog https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/The key here is that for a business that wants to do new things - you need to, well DO THINGS before you really understand how they work or what the effects are. They’re new after all!So here we start to realize that maybe a prioritized roadmap isn’t the real goal - what we need is something that can guide us, but has plenty of room for learning, refinement and experimentation along the way.Sequencing is like prioritization with more unknownsWhile not explicitly asked for, during these workshops I often end up creating a kind of sequencing view of their roadmap. If you think of strategy as the most abstract, and a roadmap as the most detailed - then a sequence is somewhere in the middle.I really like this diagram from Casey Winters’ post on the realities of a CPO role: https://caseyaccidental.com/chief-product-officer-first-yearCasey goes on to talk about not making a new strategy, but enforcing better sequencing of their existing strategy. We know what to do, but enforcing some sequencing can bring a sense of clarity to what we’re doing NOW and what we’re doing NEXT. Something weirdly missing from a lot of strategy (which often comes down to 5 things we should be doing right now).Here’s an example of a sequencing that came out of a consulting engagement with a business that sells online courses (with key details removed obviously):There’s a lot here - mostly because what this diagram shows us is what NOT to do. It allows us to choose a lane and focus.This isn’t really a prioritization (it doesn’t tell us what to do first) and isn’t really a roadmap (it doesn’t tell us when things will happen) but it still adds some clarity by ensuring the various opportunities in front of us are connected and dependent in various ways.Maybe the real value for a sequencing map like this is to help us understand how to get started with new things, and what we can expect to learn along the way. It’s making the unit of progress learning, not time.Tradeoffs and Revealed ValuesOf course you’re still left with some choice - which things do we pursue first? How do we choose between the various paths we could follow? Once you really start to explore this idea you realize that there’s far more individual belief and values work going on than you might assume for “the world of business”.I love how Vaughn Tan breaks this down in the description of his Boris workshops:Your tradeoff pattern shows more about your values than the goals you’re trying to achieve. A clothing company demonstrates different values if it is willing to use cheaper high-pesticide, water-intensive cotton than if it insists on only using low-input cotton in its products. What you choose to do and not do reveals what is and isn’t important. This is another way of saying that what a person or organization implicitly believes is valuable (or good, or moral, or worthwhile) determines the tradeoffs that are made.Different people and organizations have different tradeoff patterns because they have different values, different resources, or different constraints. Usually, all three forms of difference are at work. https://vaughntan.org/unpacking-borisRevealed values are really important - especially in small teams.It’s why I’ve started referring to product/market/founder fit instead of product/market fit. Again, the problem with most clients is not that they don’t know what to do - they know what to do, but they don’t really understand why they’re not doing it. This leads to personal frustration and burnout. So it’s key to try and design a strategy that isn’t an abstract ideal but actually aligns with the capabilities, values and beliefs of the team that is going to have to execute them…!In a two-day workshop, how much can you change beliefs and values? You can’t. But you CAN help with alignment between team members.Gaining clarity on the principlesJust like values, where there is surface level alignment but once you dig it unravels, there is also principles. Independent of the specific initiatives and measured goals, what are we trying to do?Most clients cheerfully say something like: we’re trying to grow!But when you start to unpack that, trouble starts - growth at all costs? No, of course not. Growth via raising capital? Oh lord no.It turns out there often isn’t a well articulated higher level objective. Nathan articulates that well in his piece on problems with prioritization:9. Define an organizing principleWhen anything goes, it’s impossible to choose between competing alternatives. There must be some strategic frame against which to measure ideas. But too often, the framing of this goal is taken for granted. Startups obsess over weekly growth rates, and public companies obsess over margins—but these are goals, not strategies. The best companies choose narrative frames in addition to measurable goals that help them stay focused.For example, at Substack we cared about week-over-week growth like everyone else, but we also had organizing principles like “attract quality writers who are ready to go full-time on paid newsletters” that helped us organize our roadmap. For Lex, our current organizing principle is to build the best “first draft” writing experience in the world. If we only thought about the metrics we would be lost. https://every.to/divinations/how-to-prioritize-a-roadmapWhen I was more junior in my career I never really understood the idea behind creating a list of principles for a project or team. It all seemed too abstract and management-speak. Of course it IS management-speak. Principles are essentially a compression of a strategy so that they can survive contact with different teams and different team members.As Nathan mentions here - a narrative frame for a project can be a powerful guiding force as you navigate the unknown roadmap of doing new things.In conclusion: Giving Clients New Ways of thinkingOk, so this post is far too long and rambling but here’s the reveal - maybe (maybe!) the real value for these workshops is helping clients find new ways of looking at their business reality.If we accept the premise that strategy is a fluid, evolving thing - what is the most useful outcome from a moment-in-time intervention? For it to have enduring value I think it must allow us to think through situations we have not yet encountered. New tools for thinking through problems and situations.Ways for an executive team to upgrade their thinking. Of course, no one is going to buy that directly, but I think it’s the real job to be done for this kind of workshop.So, with that frame in mind the outcome for this kind of “total business review” workshop is some combination of these four dimensions:1) New dashboards embed new ways of seeing the world. A dashboard1 is essentially an embedded mental model for how the business works - and if you can help the client create a new dashboard you can help them see the world in new ways. This is often a precursor to doing new things and doing things in new ways - because they suddenly have a measurement framework for it. You manage what you measure after all.2) Sequencing is about what NOT to do, and what we need to learn. Roadmaps imbue a false sense of confidence in the future but the reality is that if we want to do new things, or do things in new ways we need to DO things so that we can learn. Learning how they work, learning whether we’re able to pull them off, learning how resources intensive they are. So a sequencing is a middle ground between abstract strategy and detailed roadmap.3) New narrative frames. Operating within the context of the individuals, beliefs, cultures and biases of the team you’re working with it’s about seeking new principles, new clarity and new naming for ideas that seem important but hard to gain consensus on.4) Capabilities &amp; process insights. There’s often a few key insights that come out of the two day session that help unlock next steps on key projects. Putting this through the lens of learning - these tend to function a bit like accelerated knowledge - you get to skip a few loops of do -&gt; learn -&gt; do by working with someone who knows the space, or has done it before.Maybe, after all that the real value add is clarity.“ambiguity is the psychological malaise in which both mediocrity and evil thrive – an imperceptible sludge surrounding any endeavor defined by quality and visionthe most potent antidote to the toxicity of those unable, or unwilling, to offer leadership will always be: clarity”&mdash; Maxim Leyzerovich (@round) July 20, 2021If you’re interested in one of these workshops - get in touch.

  "content": "Most of my consulting work connects to “marketing strategy” in some way - clients come wanting to talk about growing their business. But the funny thing about growth and marketing is that each component is like a thread that, once pulled, unravels the whole spool.  Struggling with distribution? How’s your analytics?  Struggling with SEO? How’s your product?  Struggling with content? How’s your narrative?  Struggling with margin? How’s your sales?Every question seems to open up an interconnected mess.It’s why I start every consulting engagement asking 1,000 questions. I’m trying to understand the context of the client environment, trying to see how all the threads are interconnected.So it’s been fun recently to do a few projects that look like a “full business review” where I work with a team on strategy, but explicitly putting the whole business on the table as context. I’m thinking about scaling up and formalizing this offering so I’ve been musing about where the value is for these sessions, what clients want, and where clients get stuck.The format for these business review sessions today is:  Initial exploratory kickoff to align on objectives  Prep work to get up to speed with the quirks of the business and review existing data and documents  Two-day workshop (in a remote world typically spread over 3-4 sessions)  A summary presentation that captures the key ideas from the workshopGiven my background, these sessions typically focus on growth, but the nice thing about expanding the frame from a typical consulting engagement is we deliberately put everything on the table: operations, process, people, funding etc. It’s useful to try and look at the business as a whole so that when we get into the weeds with a particular problem (which we inevitably do) we can keep the broader business context in mind.It’s surprising how useful this broader company context is - I get the impression that most leadership teams really don’t give themselves permission to zoom in and out from macro to micro in the same session - and this causes a lot of bad decision making.The tension of course with these workshop sessions is that “strategy” and “roadmaps” are abstract concepts and not particularly useful. What can you accomplish in a two-day session that has real value for a client?In early conversations with clients we usually settle on “prioritization” as the tangible output, as in - we’ll come out of the two days with “a prioritized roadmap” or a “set of strategic priorities”.The reality is a bit messier than that - the value from the session typically ends up a mixture of: clarity around the big picture, combined with a few very specific key breakthroughs which unlock immediate action on projects.This could be a useful insight around content distribution, or an insight about SEO success, or an insight around job responsibility for an upcoming hire, or a key way to separate or integrate different business units.In the end, prioritization isn’t really the useful thing.The roadmap is not the territoryPrioritization sounds concrete but isn’t actually that interesting. Clients already know roughly what to do - and have a prioritized roadmap already. So what’s the problem?The challenge facing the client is typically some underlying feeling that what is currently on the roadmap today won’t prepare them correctly for tomorrow’s future.

  "title": "Writing, Riffs & Relationships",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/",
  "date": "February 10, 2023",
  "content": "summaryWriting on the internet is a superpower, but it can feel difficult - it can feel *heavy*. In this post I want to talk specifically about a format for writing that is deliberately designed to be easy to write, while being effective at creating connections (not pageviews).And - specifically for anyone doing \"content marketing\" to drive sales - like indie consultants, business owners and founders - the riff is a great way to create connections and conversations around your work. In short it's a tasteful and more fun way of doing outreach and sales.Enter the riff.The Anatomy of a RiffHere are the basic ingredients for a riff:  An inquisitive title, something that is not “the ultimate guide” but more “some notes on…”  A few references - connecting the dots between some links, quotes from other sources  An anecdote from your own work that provides rich texture and context for what you do  Some open questions that invite people to respond  A deliberate small list of 3-5 people you can send the post toHere’s an example from me: Some Notes on Executive Dashboards (though this has 6 references - typically 2 or 3 is enough for a riff)Here’s an example from my buddy Howard: Why tension in learning can be magic (I love the way he casually drops in the Dig kitchen arcade experience as the sawdust of his own consulting work)Why This Structure WorksThis structure works primarily because it’s easy to write, it exposes your thinking and it invites response. It means you can rely on it as a bedrock of outreach, instead of waiting for lightning to strike for big-C content marketing pieces.Let’s break it down:1. Riffs make your writing small 👐People’s first instinct with content is to try and make it polished and closed. To be useful by solving something or creating the ultimate guide to something. Those pieces of content can be good - but they’re very hard to write, and even harder to write well!Instead I prefer to take a more inquisitive and open-ended approach. I call this small-b blogging:Instead - I think most people would be better served by subscribing to small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are addressable (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and archived (i.e. you have a list of things you’ve written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and memorable (i.e. has your own design, logo or style). Writing that can live and breathe in small networks. Scale be damned.When you write for someone else’s publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/This kind of small writing is great for creating connection because it sets up a natural peer relationship. It isn’t that I know more than you and I’m blasting it in your face. “HERE, ALLOW ME TO BLAST MY EXPERTISE IN YOUR FACE”. No, instead it’s saying “Hey, here’s something I find interesting and it made me think of you”.You’re not writing from a place of authority, you’re writing from a place of curiosity. Open writing, not closed writing.2. Riffs expose the sawdust of your work 🪚If you’re planning on using riffs to generate work as an indie consultant, agency owner or founder then it’s really useful to embed in the riff a little anecdote from your work. Imagine you’re a carpenter, you want to show the sawdust. The “proof of expertise”. It’s not about giving a full case study, but rather giving a little vignette from your own work. Here’s an example quote I used in my “notes on executive dashboards” riff:  But, there’s something deeper here. Over the last few years I basically only work with the C-suite of organizations. Supposedly the “people in charge”. But time and time again my point of contact is frustrated at the state of reporting internally, while also not doing anything about it. So why not fix it?It’s this kind of writing and example that situates your work in the mind of the reader. It allows someone to create a strong mental model of the kind of work you’re doing, the kind of seniority of the work, the kind of context in which they might hire you (or, the kind of context where they might make a warm referral for you).3.

  "date": "February 10, 2023",
  "content": "summaryWriting on the internet is a superpower, but it can feel difficult - it can feel *heavy*. In this post I want to talk specifically about a format for writing that is deliberately designed to be easy to write, while being effective at creating connections (not pageviews).And - specifically for anyone doing \"content marketing\" to drive sales - like indie consultants, business owners and founders - the riff is a great way to create connections and conversations around your work. In short it's a tasteful and more fun way of doing outreach and sales.Enter the riff.The Anatomy of a RiffHere are the basic ingredients for a riff:  An inquisitive title, something that is not “the ultimate guide” but more “some notes on…”  A few references - connecting the dots between some links, quotes from other sources  An anecdote from your own work that provides rich texture and context for what you do  Some open questions that invite people to respond  A deliberate small list of 3-5 people you can send the post toHere’s an example from me: Some Notes on Executive Dashboards (though this has 6 references - typically 2 or 3 is enough for a riff)Here’s an example from my buddy Howard: Why tension in learning can be magic (I love the way he casually drops in the Dig kitchen arcade experience as the sawdust of his own consulting work)Why This Structure WorksThis structure works primarily because it’s easy to write, it exposes your thinking and it invites response. It means you can rely on it as a bedrock of outreach, instead of waiting for lightning to strike for big-C content marketing pieces.Let’s break it down:1. Riffs make your writing small 👐People’s first instinct with content is to try and make it polished and closed. To be useful by solving something or creating the ultimate guide to something. Those pieces of content can be good - but they’re very hard to write, and even harder to write well!Instead I prefer to take a more inquisitive and open-ended approach. I call this small-b blogging:Instead - I think most people would be better served by subscribing to small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are addressable (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and archived (i.e. you have a list of things you’ve written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and memorable (i.e. has your own design, logo or style). Writing that can live and breathe in small networks. Scale be damned.When you write for someone else’s publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/This kind of small writing is great for creating connection because it sets up a natural peer relationship. It isn’t that I know more than you and I’m blasting it in your face. “HERE, ALLOW ME TO BLAST MY EXPERTISE IN YOUR FACE”. No, instead it’s saying “Hey, here’s something I find interesting and it made me think of you”.You’re not writing from a place of authority, you’re writing from a place of curiosity. Open writing, not closed writing.2. Riffs expose the sawdust of your work 🪚If you’re planning on using riffs to generate work as an indie consultant, agency owner or founder then it’s really useful to embed in the riff a little anecdote from your work. Imagine you’re a carpenter, you want to show the sawdust. The “proof of expertise”. It’s not about giving a full case study, but rather giving a little vignette from your own work. Here’s an example quote I used in my “notes on executive dashboards” riff:  But, there’s something deeper here. Over the last few years I basically only work with the C-suite of organizations. Supposedly the “people in charge”. But time and time again my point of contact is frustrated at the state of reporting internally, while also not doing anything about it. So why not fix it?It’s this kind of writing and example that situates your work in the mind of the reader. It allows someone to create a strong mental model of the kind of work you’re doing, the kind of seniority of the work, the kind of context in which they might hire you (or, the kind of context where they might make a warm referral for you).3. Riffs expose threads to pull on 🧶Closed writing is boring writing. If you’ve fully explored and put to bed the topic you’re writing about then there’s very little left for someone to react to. “Nice post” someone might say.But if you deliberately leave some rough edges, some threads that the reader can pull on, then you’re inviting the reader into the conversation.

  "content": "summaryPublishing documents to the web is a well-served use case but publishing small indexes, databases and collections to the web is still an incredibly frustrating and under-served use case. Here I outline why I think it matters and a variety of approaches to solving it.IntroductionImagine you care very much about Japanese woodblock prints, and you love the web. So you decide as an interested amateur to build a website to house your library of 200k+ prints. This of course is a thing that the internet has: ukiyo-e.org - Japanese Woodblock Print Search, created by John Resig.Now, imagine that you’re not THE John Resig, world class web developer and founder of Jquery.We’ve built many tools for publishing to the web - but I want to make the claim that we have underdeveloped the tools and platforms for publishing collections, indexes and small databases. It’s too hard to build these kinds of experiences, too hard to maintain them and a lack of collaborative tools.Here’s the thesis:  Independently published and maintained collections are interesting and valuable  Publishing them to the modern web is too hard and there are few purpose-built tools that help  Collaborating and maintaining them is a tough challengeSari (building a community index Startupy) has a nice piece exploring this tension:There’s an emergence of tools like Notion, Airtable, and Readwise where people are aggregating content and resources, reviving the curated web. But at the moment these are mostly solo affairs, hidden in private or semi-private corners of the Internet, fragmented, poorly indexed, and unavailable for public use. We haven't figured out how to make them multiplayer. In cases where we’ve made them public and collaborative - here is a great example - these projects are often short-lived and poorly maintained.The stated mission of a company worth almost two trillion dollars is to “organize the world’s information” and yet the Internet remains poorly organized. https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/7gSSTJ96SEyvXeljymglO3zN4H6DCgVnrNZq8_2NX1AThere ARE tools that allow you to manage collections and indexes, for specialist use cases. Ecommerce is the most obvious example. The core needs of creating a database of products, adding metadata, enabling search and creating collections are all well served by a range of tools (Shopify, Squarespace, etc etc).Meanwhile, there are many tools that allow independent authors to create content (Wordpress, Substack, Squarespace, Ghost, Webflow etc etc). But these tools place a heavy emphasis on documents and pages and less of an emphasis on collections of objects, links and metadata.To highlight this tension, consider a couple of examples:  The personal website of Rob Giampietro lined and unlined has a lovely index-view of content but defaults to a site: search in Google to handle search.  The Cyberfeminism Index is an amazing collection of 828 resources, each with notes and quotes. Although the site has search the whole thing is a single HTML file with 100k+ lines of code.  Jarrett Fuller publishes a lovely collection of readings for people interested in design readings.design that has 251 resources but what appear to be manually created tags and no search.  My friend Jonah Dragan has been documenting amazing kids picture books, both popular and obscure. He has over 900 archived on his Instagram. How might this archive become, well, an archive?To be clear, I’m not being critical of these resources! I very much enjoy them all and love that they exist. Indie web creators will use digital bricolage to use whatever tools they have to build things and that’s great. The Cyberfeminism Index even has an explicit focus on long-term maintainability and lack of dependencies which is great.But it shows some of the potential use cases where people are looking for “database publishing”.These are all individuals - personal things. But this challenge applies to institutions too. Here’s the digital art foundation Rhizome on building their archive of digital art projects Artbase:With so many tools available for cataloguing digital archives, it may seem startling that Rhizome would have invested so much time in developing a new approach. We did so because we believe that technical infrastructure shapes the way in which knowledge about cultural heritage is created and captured, organized and shared, and that existing software infrastructure is poorly suited to born-digital cultural archives. https://rhizome.org/editorial/2021/apr/26/the-artbase-relaunches-welcome-to-linked-open-data/What do we need?Let’s think through the kinds of use cases and functionality that is important. I’d say that the core features are:  Creating collections of objects  Adding and updating metadata for the objects (ideally in bulk if needed)  Creating collections, relationships and pathways through the data  Collaborating on these with others  Publishing to the web in an easy to consume way, with stable URLs, search etc  Open standard file formats for export / import / desktop editingI think the last point is key to building an ecosystem of this stuff. We have CSV files as a kind of open standard for any kind of data - possible to open it in all kinds of applications (or even edit directly with a text editor) and yet we have no standard concept for a database file that you can just open and edit in a range of applications?Cybernetic IndexesLet’s go beyond the simple use cases though - I’m excited about building extensions and automations for these small databases. The magic of the web is that automations (via chrome extensions, bookmarklets, zapier, cloud functions, github actions, replits etc) are becoming simple, easy to build and accessible to hobby-coders, not just professional developers.In an era of chat GPT, cheap search &amp; web-crawlers how can we make any small database come alive?Here’s an example of cybernetic database I want to build: I’d like to build an index of all the artists in Brooklyn1. This would be a resource for seeing a ton of local artists and their work all in one place. A database that’s searchable, taggable. This doesn’t exist today. How would you build it?And importantly - after you’ve built it, how would you bring it to life? I’m thinking things like:  Image machine learning to auto-extract tags and classifications around color, medium etc  Web-scrapers that can periodically re-crawl the artist’s websites and update the database with new works and new infoI could probably build this myself if I was really motivated but it would require building an actual database. There’s no readily available solution (that I know of) that would enable this kind of thing…Tools &amp; ExamplesI’m still actively researching the best tools out there for this kind of work but in the meantime I’ve created an Airtable database for tools, examples of small databases and interesting reading. Take a look (or load the file directly here)An airtable of resourcesIf you have suggestions and additions - email me!DatasetteI’d like to call out Datasette in particular. Datasette is “An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data” created and maintained by Simon Willison.Of all the projects I’ve come across Datasette feels so closely ideologically aligned to what I want. It’s open source, Simon really cares about helping non-developers use it (via a cloud product, a desktop product etc) - it’s even building out web-scraping functionality! Datasette is like a swiss army knife tool for exploring data but also allows you to publish that data to the web.Everything about Datasette feels great - the only problem is that it still feels slightly too far out of reach for your average enthusiast / indie publisher. There are still a lot of command line prompts around… This is not criticism of Simon - he’s an indie developer building the whole thing!Anyway - my point is that I think Datasette is going to get easier over time and may, if you’re more technical than me, be a good tool for this today.Market-making Small DatabasesActually - maybe this isn’t a real technology problem. Or at least not completely a technology problem. I think Substack is a good analogy here. Substack’s innovation comes in two flavors: firstly it is a lovely UX for creating, publishing and maintaining a paid email list. But secondly it’s also creating social validation and educating people that running a paid email list is a viable business.I think there might be a similar market-making innovation here for small databases.Imagine a Substack for databases - an easy tool for creating, maintaining and publishing databases with the ability to restrict parts or all of it behind a pay wall. Pair it with the ability to send email updates to your audience about changes and additions. Maybe even roll in some of the data-cleanup and data-collection magic that machine learning and web scraping offers.Yes, you could assemble this exact business model today using a combination of Memberful and Airtable and Substack but…. it’s clunky. And there isn’t the market-awareness that running a business like this is viable, though there are some examples (e.g. 2pmlinks which is a paid email newsletter but has a set of small-databases attached to it called their Executive Library with collections of things like indie media businesses or an agency index).Conclusion: How can we let a thousand small libraries bloom?Depending on your mental model of the world, the shape of the data you want to work with, and your technical aptitude you might have strong reactions to this post. Things like “just use a real database!” or “no way!” or “This is missing the point” but I sincerely believe there is a whole set of publishing use cases waiting in the wings that are underserved today.I want to empower more individuals to publish, maintain and collaborate on small indexes. To build a million tiny libraries, community databases, weird collections and indie indexes.

  "title": "Digital Bricolage & Web Foraging",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/",
  "date": "January 20, 2023",
  "content": "When I reflect on the various lines of inquiry that light me up, there’s one consistent theme: digital bricolage. Bricolage is “the skill of using whatever is at hand and recombining them to create something new.”This is truly a core guiding methodology to how I approach the web: as a composable, iterable, resilient thing. Something that invites creation, play and generative exploration.CJ Eller found this lovely quote1 -While hierarchy and abstraction are valued by the structured programmers' \"planner's\" aesthetic, bricoleur programmers, like Levi-Strauss's bricoleur scientists, prefer negotiation and rearrangement of their materials. The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next. Bricoleurs use a mastery of associations and interactions. For planners, mistakes are missteps; bricoleurs use a navigation of midcourse corrections.

  "content": "When I reflect on the various lines of inquiry that light me up, there’s one consistent theme: digital bricolage. Bricolage is “the skill of using whatever is at hand and recombining them to create something new.”This is truly a core guiding methodology to how I approach the web: as a composable, iterable, resilient thing. Something that invites creation, play and generative exploration.CJ Eller found this lovely quote1 -While hierarchy and abstraction are valued by the structured programmers' \"planner's\" aesthetic, bricoleur programmers, like Levi-Strauss's bricoleur scientists, prefer negotiation and rearrangement of their materials. The bricoleur resembles the painter who stands back between brushstrokes, looks at the canvas, and only after this contemplation, decides what to do next. Bricoleurs use a mastery of associations and interactions. For planners, mistakes are missteps; bricoleurs use a navigation of midcourse corrections. For planners, a program is an instrument for premeditated control; bricoleurs have goals but set out to realize them in the spirit of a collaborative venture with the machine. For planners, getting a program to work is like \"saying one's piece\"; for bricoleurs, it is more like a conversation than a monologue. http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.htmlThis idea of digital bricolage pairs well with the idea of “web foraging” - a term I found in this great paper.

  "date": "November 10, 2022",
  "content": "Being self-employed feels a bit like being on an extended road trip. Untethered and free, but lonely and unsupported too. Ultimate freedoms combined with shallow roots. Every year I write a recap, around the anniversary of quitting my last job (Oct 24th, 2014). Here’s my recap of year 8.First you shape your narratives and then your narratives shape you.Despite writing about the power of narratives and saying things like “the indie consulting journey is all about crafting an identity” in the last year I think I still underestimated the power of narrative.In 2021/2022 the SEO MBA ramped up, took on a life of it’s own and wrecked my personal narrative like a bull in a china shop. The next year is about picking up the pieces and reformulating my indie career.But let me back up. First, some highlights:  Roxy is now in first grade - she just started wearing glasses, is sassy and creative and fun.  Indy is in pre-school, running around like a maniac wielding his “ninja swords”1  Both kids got their COVID vaccines, what a historic era for science, and what a strange era for kids…  We moved house - still in Brooklyn but with more space for the kids to bounce off the walls! Overall probably the right move but this consumed a significant amount of energy and stress this year.  This recap is a bit late (my indie-versary is Oct 24th) because I was in Australia for a client’s executive off-site for 10 days. The first time I’ve seen a client in-person since the start of the pandemic.Consultant, or…..?Almost exactly a year ago I launched the first SEO MBA course. I knew it was broadly speaking a good idea and I knew there was demand for it but it’s still rewarding to look at this chart and see how quickly it dominated my revenue (consulting revenue in blue, course revenue in red):But/and this came with some psychological cost. I launched the SEO MBA without much of a plan - I just knew there was demand for it and I knew that teaching was something I wanted to do more of.And now here we are with an almost 50/50 split between consulting and course revenue. Listen, I can’t complain! This is a huge success and I’m super grateful for everyone who’s supported and engaged with the SEO MBA. On the one hand you could view this 50/50 split as healthy - as a way to generate recurring revenue, diversifying revenue streams, becoming less reliant on client work etc etc.All these things are true.But on the other hand I feel this 50/50 split very keenly. I’ve clutched to the identity and narrative of “independent consultant” so strongly over the last 8 years that to suddenly find myself split between these identities has caused more internal anguish than I’d like to admit. Well, ok actually let me just admit it. It’s been hard. I’ve felt stuck. Paralyzed. Weirdly conflicted about simple things.I don’t have the solution yet. But before we think about that let’s stick with the recap a little further.Consulting Work RecapI’m kind of a weirdo - I actually enjoy client work. There are a lot of indie consultants and freelancers that I think view client work as a means to an end, but don’t enjoy the rituals, cycles and pressures of the consultant/client dynamic. Not me. I love it! And perhaps the biggest surprise was that between moving house, vacation and growing the SEO MBA, as my client work declined my happiness also declined.Especially at the start of the year I actively declined client work in favor of sprinting to launch a second course - and looking back I can see that there was a knock-on effect. While teaching is very rewarding (more on that in the next section), it’s not nearly as electric as consulting. At least not the way I’ve been doing it (again, more on that later).In terms of the actual client work - I’ve done some of my best, and perhaps worst work this last year.The good: kind of without noticing it the majority of my work is now P&amp;L-first. What I mean by that is that because I’m working at the executive layer inside organizations every project is a kind of finance-first project. Things like:  What should our SEO strategy be? Let’s see what size of SEO team we can fit inside this P&amp;L.  Which direction should we grow in? Let’s take a look at which business units are high margin/low margin and model out some assumptions about TAM and growth rate.  How do we invest in growth, while maintaining positive EBITDA? Let’s sequence the growth initiatives and make sure we’re realizing growth as we go.  How do I get clarity on this business? Well, let’s ensure the executive team’s dashboard is closer to profit and margin and combines input and output metrics.I’m not sure if I’m getting more of this kind of work because I’m routinely interfacing with executive teams, or whether I’ve become better at this kind of work because of the time spent teaching these skills as part of the SEO MBA? Or, or! Maybe there’s a recession going on and everyone is now concerned about top line and bottom line….?Probably some combination of the above.It’s fun though to be able to stretch across a client organization to touch product, brand, marketing, operations and connect the overall strategy back to the reality of a P&amp;L.The bad: It wasn’t all rainbows though. In early 2021 I did a content strategy project for a big tech company and I think it was some of my best work. I connected the dots smoothly between brand positioning and content strategy. I loved that project! So this year I tried to adapt the same approach for a much smaller client and… it didn’t work so well.I’ll probably write a proper post-mortem at some point but in essence I got the balance between strategy and stewardship wrong. The client pushed me to create a strategy, when they didn’t have the team in place to execute on it. The client told me that the strategy was still necessary since they were going to raise money soon. Foolishly I took them at their word - partly because I was excited to roll out my content strategy approach again - when in reality I should have pushed harder for the next most useful thing (which would likely have been a 2-3 slide version of the strategy for their VC investor deck to secure the funds combined with a focus on hiring their marketing team).I’ve been using this phrase “the next most useful thing” as a guiding light for my consulting work - I’m obsessed with being useful not just right. I’ve always rejected the fancy presentation in favor of the next most useful thing, and I simply took my eye off the ball with this one. I’m not even sure the client views this project as a real disappointment, there was still some value in it, but I’m mad at myself personally for this one. A good reminder not to take your eye off the ball. And to push your clients beyond what they tell you the right answer is.Anyway, while consulting work over the past year has been very patchy I just signed 3 new clients this week and I’m gonna be busy for a little bit. Feels good to get back into the consulting flow. Let’s crack open some P&amp;Ls.SEO MBA RecapI’m going to write a separate full recap for the SEO MBA [live now!] because there’s a whole world there - but let’s look at some key pieces:  The email list launched early 2021 and is now 8,000+ subscribers. Unfortunately I think that number is a little off since Substack has been juicing growth aggressively in the last 6 months and I’m not sure those users are high quality. Still, this number is bigger than I would have guessed!  The first course, Executive Presence is truly the flagship course. It’s the most differentiated in the market and has sustained more demand than the second course The Art of Client Management. I’m super proud of both courses and think both are deeply valuable, but people want to learn executive presence more than they want to learn client management. One is aspirational in nature, where one is more functional.  Learning how to shoot video, produce courses and design teaching programs has been interesting and rewarding.  I made a whole 3rd course that I scrapped before launch because I didn’t think it was good enough.When I designed the initial SEO MBA program I consciously avoided the live-teaching model of a cohort based course. I didn’t want to chain myself to that cadence and cycle of promotion/waitlist/course event. I think this was the right decision, but it also meant that a lot of my day to day with the SEO MBA is just me in front of a laptop. It’s “teaching” in the abstract but not in practical terms.So as I think about evolving and next steps I need to think about how to make the teaching a bit more active and electric. I’ll likely dabble with live cohorts as a complement to the self-paced courses.Meanwhile, the weekly office hours have continued and been a constant source of joy! The people that continue to show up here and invest time with the course really get a deep sense of growth from it. New perspectives, new jobs, new confidence, new clarity. These sessions end up being high value because everyone has a shared grounding from the course. I’m going to keep doing these.But the future roadmap for the SEO MBA is very unclear. Step on the gas with growth, ads etc? Fold in courses by other teachers? Continue to launch new courses? Double down and focus on the executive presence course? Transition to a membership model? Something else?We’ll see. I’m actively working my way through these questions right now. Shout if you have ideas.Writing Recap2022 was a great year for writing! In addition to the 20 SEO MBA newsletters I sent, I wrote 25 blog posts here on this site.I even briefly tried to sustain a weekly blogging habit! This flushed the cache for a few of my old drafts, felt energizing and generated two HN homepages. Wild what a little bit of consistent output can do! Then the summer came, buying a house and life etc and I fell off the wagon. I’d like to get back there though (maybe this is the first of my weekly blogging habit again? Let’s check in next year).My fave SEO MBA pieces I wrote this year:  Is SEO worth it? - taking a little 20% beef with the SEO industry over how we talk about “SEO” investment (spoiler alert, most of the benefit of SEO doesn’t come from the SEO team).  Nerding out on Nerdwallet - I loved writing this piece dissecting the Nerdwallet S-1 filing in detail. Helped me understand P&amp;Ls a bit more and helped me deepen my understanding of commerce content.  The SEO skills maturity matrix - hopefully a very concrete and tangible career map for SEO folks, and also a rallying cry for the “soft skills” that the SEO MBA teaches.My fave personal blog posts this year:  Jan 2022 - Map of Inquiry - trying to expose the questions that are alive and interesting for me right now. This helped create some through lines across various pieces of work and writing.  Electric Tables V0.1 - some personal R&amp;D work! I absolutely loved creating Electric Tables. It was a great way to manifest a point of view through a prototype. Really proud of how this came out. I’d love to carve out more time for this kind of tinkering.  Notes on teaching &amp; chairs - pondering my relationship to teaching and exploring my personal mental model for creating learning environments (see also bezier butts).  Some notes on executive dashboards - you can see how this emerged out of my consulting work this year. I’m very happy with how this post came out and it generated a bunch of conversations behind the scenes2.  Reflecting on things I failed to get done at Google - personal therapy dealing with my time working at Google a decade ago. I wish I’d written this post a few years ago but I simply wasn’t ready yet.  A map for indie living - maybe the best thing I’ve written about the indie consulting journey?! I bashed this out in an afternoon but people still reference this one. I think the “levels” I wrote about here really ring true for people and it comes with a set of practical ideas too. This map is going to make it into the book for sure!  Rejecting specialization - while this was the only actual writing I did this year for the book project I’m very happy with how it came out. This was a nice contrarian take and nails a few really important ideas about indie consulting (imho!)  Some notes on agency at work - as I’ve wrestled with a way to unify my work and my fragmented identity this idea of “increasing agency” has emerged as a very generative and important throughline. There’s more excavation to be done here but I really like this sense of purpose that sits across all different kinds of things I’ve been doing.Just re-reading that list and exploring the writing from the past year I feel energized to keep going. I love writing. And it’s a big win this year that I’ve been able to do so much of it.What’s that? Oh, the book. Yes! Hmm. I’m still very much gung-ho on the book project but it is becoming ridiculous how much it’s dragging on at this point. Between the house buying, building the SEO MBA and the identity crisis the book has very much taken a backseat. But if I’m honest maybe the book is the right kind of project to crack open the future and find new opportunities, new identities?I’ve basically written the first draft of the book - what I need now is to find an editor who can be very hands on in helping turn the body of writing into a finished manuscript. Know anyone? Send them my way.Networks workA huge, truly heartfelt thank you to everyone who’s supported and helped me this year. More than in previous years I’ve had to lean on my network for support, advice, company and feedback. Folks like Brian, Toby, Elan, Behzod, Howard, Sean, John, Jim &amp; the other Jim.As I write this, Twitter is on the precipice. I’m not going to pretend I know how this plays out but we’ve never seen a platform like Twitter for converting casual internet connections into deep friendships and for all it’s troubles I hope that whatever emerges from this current mess (Twitter or otherwise) can sustain the next decade of internet-friends.This past year has been a deep reminder of the power of networks. Much love to you all. ❤️❤️❤️So, what’s next?Oh haha you crazy fool. If you’ve read this far, I obviously have no idea. But, that’s the promise of indie living!Here’s about all I know:  I’m not going to go “all-in” on the SEO MBA, at least not yet. Because consulting work is still generative and electric for me. I love it.  There is a bunch of relatively basic growth work to be done for the SEO MBA (email funnels, that kind of thing). Tune in next year to see if I can motivate myself to do them.  The SEO MBA “as is” has been a wonderful first step into teaching. Deeply rewarding (and lucrative!) but the next phase and evolution has to make teaching feel a bit more electric if it’s going to compete with my consulting work.  I’m going to pull myself out of this identity slump by sheer force of will. Watch me (tune in next year to see how that goes).  I’m excited to keep up the writing habit! Bloggy-blog-blog!And finally, a big shout out to Paul Millerd. Fellow indie consultant, fellow course creator, fellow book author! Watching from afar I get the sense that Paul is just hitting his stride this year and it’s amazing to see. I love seeing other indie consultants thrive and come alive.I’ll leave you with this piece from Paul on ambition:Over the last couple of years, I’ve experienced a complete transformation and reawakening of my own curiosity and desire to do challenging things in life and work.&nbsp; While similar to my early career enthusiasm, this feeling is deeper, more powerful, and likely sustainable.I believe the best way to describe this shift is as a shift from legible ambition to illegible ambition. The reason so many people cling to default metrics of success is that other people understand them. Legible ambition is a story that your parents can tell their friends. We fear that not having such legible ambition means we will be cast out of our modern work-centered culture.Illegible ambition is personal, hard if not impossible to describe to others, and might not lead anywhere impressive, sometimes for years. But it is also immensely powerful. Illegible ambition is about connecting to who we really are and doing work in a state that friend and fellow internet weirdo David Perell perfectly describes as “hearts on fire.”Paul Millerd https://boundless.substack.com/p/the-great-creator-arbitrage-opportunityWhile I relearn how to steer and orient myself on this independent journey, perhaps a shift to illegible ambition is required…As ever, I sense the winds of change a-blowing.            His arms. His ninja swords are his arms. They go everywhere with him &#8617;              Curiously though this piece didn’t generate any direct client work. That wasn’t the point but I did kind of expect this to generate some interest. Perhaps it was too introspective for that…? &#8617;      "

Well, ok actually let me just admit it. It’s been hard. I’ve felt stuck. Paralyzed. Weirdly conflicted about simple things.I don’t have the solution yet. But before we think about that let’s stick with the recap a little further.Consulting Work RecapI’m kind of a weirdo - I actually enjoy client work. There are a lot of indie consultants and freelancers that I think view client work as a means to an end, but don’t enjoy the rituals, cycles and pressures of the consultant/client dynamic. Not me. I love it! And perhaps the biggest surprise was that between moving house, vacation and growing the SEO MBA, as my client work declined my happiness also declined.Especially at the start of the year I actively declined client work in favor of sprinting to launch a second course - and looking back I can see that there was a knock-on effect. While teaching is very rewarding (more on that in the next section), it’s not nearly as electric as consulting. At least not the way I’ve been doing it (again, more on that later).In terms of the actual client work - I’ve done some of my best, and perhaps worst work this last year.The good: kind of without noticing it the majority of my work is now P&amp;L-first. What I mean by that is that because I’m working at the executive layer inside organizations every project is a kind of finance-first project. Things like:  What should our SEO strategy be? Let’s see what size of SEO team we can fit inside this P&amp;L.  Which direction should we grow in? Let’s take a look at which business units are high margin/low margin and model out some assumptions about TAM and growth rate.  How do we invest in growth, while maintaining positive EBITDA? Let’s sequence the growth initiatives and make sure we’re realizing growth as we go.  How do I get clarity on this business? Well, let’s ensure the executive team’s dashboard is closer to profit and margin and combines input and output metrics.I’m not sure if I’m getting more of this kind of work because I’m routinely interfacing with executive teams, or whether I’ve become better at this kind of work because of the time spent teaching these skills as part of the SEO MBA? Or, or! Maybe there’s a recession going on and everyone is now concerned about top line and bottom line….?Probably some combination of the above.It’s fun though to be able to stretch across a client organization to touch product, brand, marketing, operations and connect the overall strategy back to the reality of a P&amp;L.The bad: It wasn’t all rainbows though. In early 2021 I did a content strategy project for a big tech company and I think it was some of my best work. I connected the dots smoothly between brand positioning and content strategy. I loved that project! So this year I tried to adapt the same approach for a much smaller client and… it didn’t work so well.I’ll probably write a proper post-mortem at some point but in essence I got the balance between strategy and stewardship wrong. The client pushed me to create a strategy, when they didn’t have the team in place to execute on it. The client told me that the strategy was still necessary since they were going to raise money soon. Foolishly I took them at their word - partly because I was excited to roll out my content strategy approach again - when in reality I should have pushed harder for the next most useful thing (which would likely have been a 2-3 slide version of the strategy for their VC investor deck to secure the funds combined with a focus on hiring their marketing team).I’ve been using this phrase “the next most useful thing” as a guiding light for my consulting work - I’m obsessed with being useful not just right. I’ve always rejected the fancy presentation in favor of the next most useful thing, and I simply took my eye off the ball with this one. I’m not even sure the client views this project as a real disappointment, there was still some value in it, but I’m mad at myself personally for this one. A good reminder not to take your eye off the ball. And to push your clients beyond what they tell you the right answer is.Anyway, while consulting work over the past year has been very patchy I just signed 3 new clients this week and I’m gonna be busy for a little bit. Feels good to get back into the consulting flow. Let’s crack open some P&amp;Ls.SEO MBA RecapI’m going to write a separate full recap for the SEO MBA [live now!] because there’s a whole world there - but let’s look at some key pieces:  The email list launched early 2021 and is now 8,000+ subscribers. Unfortunately I think that number is a little off since Substack has been juicing growth aggressively in the last 6 months and I’m not sure those users are high quality. Still, this number is bigger than I would have guessed!  The first course, Executive Presence is truly the flagship course. It’s the most differentiated in the market and has sustained more demand than the second course The Art of Client Management. I’m super proud of both courses and think both are deeply valuable, but people want to learn executive presence more than they want to learn client management. One is aspirational in nature, where one is more functional.  Learning how to shoot video, produce courses and design teaching programs has been interesting and rewarding.  I made a whole 3rd course that I scrapped before launch because I didn’t think it was good enough.When I designed the initial SEO MBA program I consciously avoided the live-teaching model of a cohort based course. I didn’t want to chain myself to that cadence and cycle of promotion/waitlist/course event. I think this was the right decision, but it also meant that a lot of my day to day with the SEO MBA is just me in front of a laptop. It’s “teaching” in the abstract but not in practical terms.So as I think about evolving and next steps I need to think about how to make the teaching a bit more active and electric. I’ll likely dabble with live cohorts as a complement to the self-paced courses.Meanwhile, the weekly office hours have continued and been a constant source of joy! The people that continue to show up here and invest time with the course really get a deep sense of growth from it. New perspectives, new jobs, new confidence, new clarity. These sessions end up being high value because everyone has a shared grounding from the course. I’m going to keep doing these.But the future roadmap for the SEO MBA is very unclear. Step on the gas with growth, ads etc? Fold in courses by other teachers? Continue to launch new courses? Double down and focus on the executive presence course? Transition to a membership model? Something else?We’ll see. I’m actively working my way through these questions right now. Shout if you have ideas.Writing Recap2022 was a great year for writing! In addition to the 20 SEO MBA newsletters I sent, I wrote 25 blog posts here on this site.I even briefly tried to sustain a weekly blogging habit! This flushed the cache for a few of my old drafts, felt energizing and generated two HN homepages. Wild what a little bit of consistent output can do! Then the summer came, buying a house and life etc and I fell off the wagon. I’d like to get back there though (maybe this is the first of my weekly blogging habit again? Let’s check in next year).My fave SEO MBA pieces I wrote this year:  Is SEO worth it? - taking a little 20% beef with the SEO industry over how we talk about “SEO” investment (spoiler alert, most of the benefit of SEO doesn’t come from the SEO team).  Nerding out on Nerdwallet - I loved writing this piece dissecting the Nerdwallet S-1 filing in detail. Helped me understand P&amp;Ls a bit more and helped me deepen my understanding of commerce content.  The SEO skills maturity matrix - hopefully a very concrete and tangible career map for SEO folks, and also a rallying cry for the “soft skills” that the SEO MBA teaches.My fave personal blog posts this year:  Jan 2022 - Map of Inquiry - trying to expose the questions that are alive and interesting for me right now. This helped create some through lines across various pieces of work and writing.  Electric Tables V0.1 - some personal R&amp;D work! I absolutely loved creating Electric Tables. It was a great way to manifest a point of view through a prototype. Really proud of how this came out. I’d love to carve out more time for this kind of tinkering.  Notes on teaching &amp; chairs - pondering my relationship to teaching and exploring my personal mental model for creating learning environments (see also bezier butts).  Some notes on executive dashboards - you can see how this emerged out of my consulting work this year. I’m very happy with how this post came out and it generated a bunch of conversations behind the scenes2.  Reflecting on things I failed to get done at Google - personal therapy dealing with my time working at Google a decade ago. I wish I’d written this post a few years ago but I simply wasn’t ready yet.  A map for indie living - maybe the best thing I’ve written about the indie consulting journey?! I bashed this out in an afternoon but people still reference this one. I think the “levels” I wrote about here really ring true for people and it comes with a set of practical ideas too. This map is going to make it into the book for sure!  Rejecting specialization - while this was the only actual writing I did this year for the book project I’m very happy with how it came out. This was a nice contrarian take and nails a few really important ideas about indie consulting (imho!)  Some notes on agency at work - as I’ve wrestled with a way to unify my work and my fragmented identity this idea of “increasing agency” has emerged as a very generative and important throughline. There’s more excavation to be done here but I really like this sense of purpose that sits across all different kinds of things I’ve been doing.Just re-reading that list and exploring the writing from the past year I feel energized to keep going. I love writing. And it’s a big win this year that I’ve been able to do so much of it.What’s that? Oh, the book. Yes! Hmm. I’m still very much gung-ho on the book project but it is becoming ridiculous how much it’s dragging on at this point. Between the house buying, building the SEO MBA and the identity crisis the book has very much taken a backseat. But if I’m honest maybe the book is the right kind of project to crack open the future and find new opportunities, new identities?I’ve basically written the first draft of the book - what I need now is to find an editor who can be very hands on in helping turn the body of writing into a finished manuscript. Know anyone? Send them my way.Networks workA huge, truly heartfelt thank you to everyone who’s supported and helped me this year. More than in previous years I’ve had to lean on my network for support, advice, company and feedback. Folks like Brian, Toby, Elan, Behzod, Howard, Sean, John, Jim &amp; the other Jim.As I write this, Twitter is on the precipice. I’m not going to pretend I know how this plays out but we’ve never seen a platform like Twitter for converting casual internet connections into deep friendships and for all it’s troubles I hope that whatever emerges from this current mess (Twitter or otherwise) can sustain the next decade of internet-friends.This past year has been a deep reminder of the power of networks. Much love to you all. ❤️❤️❤️So, what’s next?Oh haha you crazy fool. If you’ve read this far, I obviously have no idea. But, that’s the promise of indie living!Here’s about all I know:  I’m not going to go “all-in” on the SEO MBA, at least not yet. Because consulting work is still generative and electric for me. I love it.  There is a bunch of relatively basic growth work to be done for the SEO MBA (email funnels, that kind of thing). Tune in next year to see if I can motivate myself to do them.  The SEO MBA “as is” has been a wonderful first step into teaching. Deeply rewarding (and lucrative!) but the next phase and evolution has to make teaching feel a bit more electric if it’s going to compete with my consulting work.  I’m going to pull myself out of this identity slump by sheer force of will. Watch me (tune in next year to see how that goes).  I’m excited to keep up the writing habit! Bloggy-blog-blog!And finally, a big shout out to Paul Millerd. Fellow indie consultant, fellow course creator, fellow book author! Watching from afar I get the sense that Paul is just hitting his stride this year and it’s amazing to see. I love seeing other indie consultants thrive and come alive.I’ll leave you with this piece from Paul on ambition:Over the last couple of years, I’ve experienced a complete transformation and reawakening of my own curiosity and desire to do challenging things in life and work.&nbsp; While similar to my early career enthusiasm, this feeling is deeper, more powerful, and likely sustainable.I believe the best way to describe this shift is as a shift from legible ambition to illegible ambition. The reason so many people cling to default metrics of success is that other people understand them. Legible ambition is a story that your parents can tell their friends. We fear that not having such legible ambition means we will be cast out of our modern work-centered culture.Illegible ambition is personal, hard if not impossible to describe to others, and might not lead anywhere impressive, sometimes for years. But it is also immensely powerful. Illegible ambition is about connecting to who we really are and doing work in a state that friend and fellow internet weirdo David Perell perfectly describes as “hearts on fire.”Paul Millerd https://boundless.substack.com/p/the-great-creator-arbitrage-opportunityWhile I relearn how to steer and orient myself on this independent journey, perhaps a shift to illegible ambition is required…As ever, I sense the winds of change a-blowing.            His arms. His ninja swords are his arms. They go everywhere with him &#8617;              Curiously though this piece didn’t generate any direct client work. That wasn’t the point but I did kind of expect this to generate some interest. Perhaps it was too introspective for that…? &#8617;      "

He calls it a hot take, but clearly everyone agrees that the annual planning process is a bit broken!There’s a nice variety of perspectives and I encourage you to read the whole thing but in particular I like this concept of explicitly planning various ideas on different time horizons:From Ben Williams, VP Product at Snyk:“The best annual planning processes are aligned but not uniform across the org. There may be some functions (GTM org in B2B for example) where they weigh more heavily to thinking through that longer time horizon, and other functions (eg R&amp;D) where thinking through and discussing priorities and goals for the year may be useful, but that you're going to need to plan and mobilize teams far more dynamically - most likely on a quarterly basis.”Adam Fishman https://www.fishmanafnewsletter.com/p/annual-planning-is-a-waste-of-timeThis maps well to my experience - the company wants to set a 1/3/5 year goal (which might be fine!) but there are lots of nascent initiatives that you simply can’t talk about over that time horizon yet. They’re still incubating.👻🎃💀Vaughn Tan has a deep dive on his approach to strategy planning called Boris: Unpacking Boris:Boris is a facilitated workshop I run for organization leadership teams that fixes this problem. Boris significantly improves on conventional goal-setting processes (such as OKRs) by taking a fundamentally different approach that focuses on understanding acceptable tradeoffs among participants. The outcome of Boris is that different parts of the organization become free to operate autonomously in pursuit of the organization’s shared goals without working at cross-purposes to each other. https://vaughntan.org/unpacking-borisThere’s a lot of this that resonates with me - many executive strategy planning sessions come out with a nice-sounding strategy which just crumbles as soon as various teams start trying to shoe-horn their own agenda onto it. In fact teams can end up working against each other which is the exact opposite outcome you’re trying to get to with a strategy planning session!👻🎃💀I’m still working on a formalized process and methodology for running executive off-sites. I have an approach and format that works but I think it can be more opinionated. And obviously the best approach is tailored to the specific company and situation.But here’s some principles I think are worth aiming for:  Pre-work is essential. There’s a lot of value in holding space for the executive team to come together and review the whole parts of the business. This requires each function preparing a useful deepdive and situation report of how that function works. This pre-work needs to be carefully managed, thought through and you need to enforce that the executive team spends time with the pre-work before the offsite.  Don’t stop the deep-dives. Sometimes executives get confused (or are too afraid) to step on toes and so avoid getting into the weeds. It’s seen as a waste of time or somehow not practical to spend the exec team’s time discussion “lower level” things. But where there are critical initiatives (see John’s point about points of leverage) I think you should get into as much detail as you can.  Be explicit about company clocks. Brian and I wrote about company clocks and I think one of the most useful outputs from an executive team is a sense of how urgent something is. Not everything is equal and agreeing not just on what needs to be done, but how fast it should be moving is useful.  Make the trade-offs clear. Cribbing this one from Vaughn - being explicit about tradeoffs helps reveal areas where projects may be unrealistic, or where teams actually have competing values.👻🎃💀Of course, all of this is trying to make the strategy planning session useful. But it assumes that the strategy is the most important outcome of the session. In reality, a lot of the value for an executive strategy session lies in the communication:  Ensuring that senior leaders feel like they are a part of the executive team and involved in decision making  Giving the executives a space to practice defending their decisions and talking about the roadmap  Finding shared language between functions so that after the offsite the various teams and functions across the organization feel like the company has a plan and has it’s @!#% together!If the CEO company all-hands is a theatre performance. Then the executive offsite is the dress rehearsal.I use the language of theatre to suggest that performance, communication, language and feeling are important. But don’t be fooled - just because we live in the theatre of work doesn’t make it any less important or useful.👻🎃💀What is the best executive offsite you’ve ever been to?

  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/09/13/flow-innovation/",
  "date": "September 13, 2022",
  "content": "A lot of innovation work revolves around shiny objects - maybe a slick interactive prototype, or a concept video. A lot of innovation projects never see the light of day.Maybe what’s needed are fewer shiny objects and more trails. Fewer artifacts and more paths. Less high concept innovation and more cabinet of curios.💡The first innovation project I worked on at Google Creative Lab was a 5-year vision for “The future of search”. We ended up creating the shiniest of shiny artifacts - a 15 minute live action video showing a day in the life of this future search world. We filmed some segments at the Museum of Natural History in New York. I almost broke a dinosaur bone carrying a lighting stand. We used the same special effects company as the Star Trek movie.The Google Creative Lab knows a thing or two about failed innovation. When I worked there in 2012 it seemed like the majority of their innovation projects failed. There was a lot of work that never became more than a slick video and a beautiful presentation. I can only think how many projects have been concepted and shelved in the decade since.I can’t speak to how the Creative Lab is now but back in 2012 it was very disconnected from the rest of Google. Sat in an ivory tower (almost literally!) this distance and separation was, I think, part of what enabled the team to work on weird and wonderful projects without oversight. But it was also the downfall of many of the projects that tried to bridge the gap and inform the main corporate strategy of Google proper.From new kinds of shopping ads to a vision for the future of search - things that tried to influence the core direction of Google products inevitably “failed”.But I put quotes around the word “failed” because innovation is a funny kind of work.💡As a consultant, I worked on an NYT R&amp;D project - I was part of a team that researched, scoped and designed some new travel verticals for the Times. We pitched the project in Feb 2020. Not a great time for a travel project in hindsight…Like I said, I know a bit about failed innovation.💡I think a lot of people who work in innovation get frustrated. Frustrated that their ideas don’t get absorbed by the main business. Frustrated that their prototypes don’t get funding. Frustrated that their ideas aren’t heard.The further you are from the core business the more freedom you have, but at the expense of influence. The closer you are to the core business the less freedom and creativity you have, but the more influence you have. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.Is innovation work just a game of percentages? Take a bunch of swings and eventually some of the ideas might stick? Is your “hit rate” even the right metric for an innovation lab?The funny thing is that a lot of innovation projects “fail” - they don’t get funding or don’t get built - but some part of the innovation work eventually bleeds out into the world. Sometimes it’s as small as a logo, or a name. Sometimes it’s a unique interaction pattern. Or sometimes the innovation is swallowed whole, consumed and only years later emerges on the product roadmap. Imperceptible, the impact of the innovation work only visible to the team that worked on it.A lot of innovation work only fails if you measure it the wrong way.💡Managing innovation work is about controlling narrative as much as it’s about controlling cost/timing/project management.We had a custom-built project management solution at the Creative Lab (I think it was called OTIS?). It basically stripped away any of the kinds of features that you might expect in a project management tool and reduced every project to a weekly 100-character status update, paired with a link to the latest creative work (presentation, design, video, etc). Every Monday morning the Creative Lab leadership team would huddle around and review the status updates for each project.At the time I don’t think I understood how powerful narrative is inside large organizations. I thought building a business case, modeling out impact and so on were how you got buy-in and budget.💡One of the most interesting innovation projects I was part of was with my friends at Part+Sum. I was part of a week-long innovation workshop with P+S employees, external advisors, client team members and customers. Essentially, this brings the client into the innovation work for a week1.Inviting the client into the innovation work itself (vs just showing the shiny object at the end of the sprint) I believe makes the work better but also means the client is more invested in the end result.Innovation work that fits the client’s business model and constraints. And that the client is invested in bringing to life. Embracing from the beginning the idea that the innovation work is far less likely to be shipped “as is” and more likely to be subsumed and assimilated by the larger organization, the impact bleeding out over time.And here, in this innovation sprint model, the impact is as much the prototypes created as it is the experience of the employees directly of the innovation process.💡I’ve been reading The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process in which Manuel explores the idea of a “space of flows”:The space of flows is a high-level cultural abstraction of space and time, and their dynamic interactions with digital age society. The concept was created by the sociologist and cybernetic culture theoretician Manuel Castells to \"reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flowsI like this framing. And I think it fits innovation work well. What if we placed less emphasis on the shiny object and more on the “space of flows”?💡Professional work is all about streams and flows - we’re almost a decade into the stream-ification of work.

  "title": "Slouching Towards Innovation",

  "content": "A lot of innovation work revolves around shiny objects - maybe a slick interactive prototype, or a concept video. A lot of innovation projects never see the light of day.Maybe what’s needed are fewer shiny objects and more trails. Fewer artifacts and more paths. Less high concept innovation and more cabinet of curios.💡The first innovation project I worked on at Google Creative Lab was a 5-year vision for “The future of search”. We ended up creating the shiniest of shiny artifacts - a 15 minute live action video showing a day in the life of this future search world. We filmed some segments at the Museum of Natural History in New York. I almost broke a dinosaur bone carrying a lighting stand. We used the same special effects company as the Star Trek movie.The Google Creative Lab knows a thing or two about failed innovation. When I worked there in 2012 it seemed like the majority of their innovation projects failed. There was a lot of work that never became more than a slick video and a beautiful presentation. I can only think how many projects have been concepted and shelved in the decade since.I can’t speak to how the Creative Lab is now but back in 2012 it was very disconnected from the rest of Google. Sat in an ivory tower (almost literally!) this distance and separation was, I think, part of what enabled the team to work on weird and wonderful projects without oversight. But it was also the downfall of many of the projects that tried to bridge the gap and inform the main corporate strategy of Google proper.From new kinds of shopping ads to a vision for the future of search - things that tried to influence the core direction of Google products inevitably “failed”.But I put quotes around the word “failed” because innovation is a funny kind of work.💡As a consultant, I worked on an NYT R&amp;D project - I was part of a team that researched, scoped and designed some new travel verticals for the Times. We pitched the project in Feb 2020. Not a great time for a travel project in hindsight…Like I said, I know a bit about failed innovation.💡I think a lot of people who work in innovation get frustrated. Frustrated that their ideas don’t get absorbed by the main business. Frustrated that their prototypes don’t get funding. Frustrated that their ideas aren’t heard.The further you are from the core business the more freedom you have, but at the expense of influence. The closer you are to the core business the less freedom and creativity you have, but the more influence you have. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.Is innovation work just a game of percentages? Take a bunch of swings and eventually some of the ideas might stick? Is your “hit rate” even the right metric for an innovation lab?The funny thing is that a lot of innovation projects “fail” - they don’t get funding or don’t get built - but some part of the innovation work eventually bleeds out into the world. Sometimes it’s as small as a logo, or a name. Sometimes it’s a unique interaction pattern. Or sometimes the innovation is swallowed whole, consumed and only years later emerges on the product roadmap. Imperceptible, the impact of the innovation work only visible to the team that worked on it.A lot of innovation work only fails if you measure it the wrong way.💡Managing innovation work is about controlling narrative as much as it’s about controlling cost/timing/project management.We had a custom-built project management solution at the Creative Lab (I think it was called OTIS?). It basically stripped away any of the kinds of features that you might expect in a project management tool and reduced every project to a weekly 100-character status update, paired with a link to the latest creative work (presentation, design, video, etc). Every Monday morning the Creative Lab leadership team would huddle around and review the status updates for each project.At the time I don’t think I understood how powerful narrative is inside large organizations. I thought building a business case, modeling out impact and so on were how you got buy-in and budget.💡One of the most interesting innovation projects I was part of was with my friends at Part+Sum. I was part of a week-long innovation workshop with P+S employees, external advisors, client team members and customers. Essentially, this brings the client into the innovation work for a week1.Inviting the client into the innovation work itself (vs just showing the shiny object at the end of the sprint) I believe makes the work better but also means the client is more invested in the end result.Innovation work that fits the client’s business model and constraints. And that the client is invested in bringing to life. Embracing from the beginning the idea that the innovation work is far less likely to be shipped “as is” and more likely to be subsumed and assimilated by the larger organization, the impact bleeding out over time.And here, in this innovation sprint model, the impact is as much the prototypes created as it is the experience of the employees directly of the innovation process.💡I’ve been reading The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process in which Manuel explores the idea of a “space of flows”:The space of flows is a high-level cultural abstraction of space and time, and their dynamic interactions with digital age society. The concept was created by the sociologist and cybernetic culture theoretician Manuel Castells to \"reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flowsI like this framing. And I think it fits innovation work well. What if we placed less emphasis on the shiny object and more on the “space of flows”?💡Professional work is all about streams and flows - we’re almost a decade into the stream-ification of work. Slack heralded an era of realtime notifications, channels (as virtual spaces to work in) and flows of work.And shiny objects aren’t really designed for flows. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.So a lot of companies are trying to figure out how to adapt their work to flows and streams. How to remember things for longer periods of time. How to capture learnings that compound instead of getting washed away.How do you adapt innovation work in a post-document / post-shiny-object culture?💡Talking about the “space of flows”… two new approaches to feeds that caught my eye:Campsite.design from Brian Lovin - “The home for your design team’s work-in-progress”.

  "title": "Some Notes on Agency at Work",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/07/05/agency/",
  "date": "July 5, 2022",
  "content": "I’ve been trying to make sense of my work recently. Launching the SEO MBA kind of bifurcated my possible futures into “consulting” and “course creating” - different types of work with different kinds of audiences. My consulting work is with senior executives and founders while the SEO MBA is aimed at SEO professionals.How to reconcile these possible futures and possible selves?Through a bunch of conversations with close friends - maybe the common throughline is increasing agency.Specifically - the idea of increasing agency for people’s work selves. This feels promising as a potential north star because it neatly aligns with the big things I’m spending my time on:  Consulting work: My consulting work these days is mostly about two things - it’s about bringing strategic clarity to executives and helping organizations build new capabilities. My best client work involves very long engagements where I get to know my point of contact very well. This work blurs the boundaries between consulting and coaching. And it’s all about increasing agency - increasing the clarity and sense of forward momentum.  SEO MBA teaching: The courses I’ve built (especially the course on Executive Presence) help people increase their personal agency. It’s not really about teaching skills as much as it’s providing new vantage points and new ways of conducting yourself so that you can take on more senior work. There are plenty of stories of people taking the course and then getting a new job. This is more than just “upskilling” - it’s about increasing agency.  Indie consulting book: The core thesis for the book is how to build a sustainable independent consulting practice. And much of the writing is about how to maintain autonomy and agency despite pressures to standardize your work and narrow your focus. This is very much in line with an idea of “increasing agency for indie consultants”.So in effect you could argue that I’ve been focused on increasing agency for: executives, SEO professionals and indie consultants.Feels right. I certainly get a kick out of this kind of work.🕹️One of the first distinctions to tease apart is the difference between fulfilling work and high-agency work. From David MacIver with some great notes on fulfilling work:And there are aspects of employment I miss a great deal, even if there are other aspects that I do not miss at all.To me it feels like there's some sort of central human experience which has all of the following components:A group of people, working together on a problem.The problem has an actual (even if small) impact on the world.The problem is difficult and without working hard on it they will fail.All (or most) of the people in the group actually care about the problem and want to succeed.No member of the group could succeed at the problem on their own.Each member of the group is an active participant in the process, and the end result depends on how well they fulfill their role.Possibly this list isn't sufficient, but it all seems necessary to be an example of the thing I'm pointing to, which one might as well call something like \"fulfilling work\".David R. MacIver https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-17-09:08.htmlDavid goes on to suggest that work almost never meets these criteria, and that’s partly why chasing “fulfilling work” might be the wrong objective. Work with purpose and meaning sounds nice but might be impossible to reach? It’s not quite what I’m getting at with increasing agency.High-agency work is almost independent of work with purpose and meaning. Except my hunch is that these two concepts are actually deeply intertwined…More to unearth and think about.🕹️I sketched out this 2x2 for the kinds of “joy of work” that we might talk about. Just a sketch:Where:  High Skills / Inner World: This is the kind of raw skills of personal productivity. Within your own personal sphere can you optimize your ways of working? This might involve organizing your work, inbox zero, clearing up your calendar, etc. I think this kind of work is appealing when you’re early in your career because it doesn’t require anyone else giving you permission and can be done in almost any context. Level up your own personal systems as a way to control your work.  High Skills / Outer World: This is your ability to create systems of influence. To be able to improve the systems and processes around you. This is appealing as you get more senior and develop more “executive presence”. This kind of work scales all the way up to formal management roles where imposing clarity, systems, process and order onto teams and systems is appealing. Essentially, can you control the world around you?  High Meaning / Inner World: This is the idea of doing day to day work that is stimulating. Are the tasks in front of you energizing? If you like spending time in spreadsheets are you spending time in spreadsheets? If you like designing, are you spending time in Figma? This is where the concept of flow comes in - are you spending chunks of your day in enjoyable focused work.  High Meaning / Outer World: This is the big idea of “work with purpose” - fulfilling work that has meaning in the world around you. This has high ideals of purpose and doing good - but could also be measured as impact. Is the work you’re doing creating a tangible impact in the world?🕹️When you put together a course, you’re supposed to focus on the personal transformation, not the skills. Complete the phrase “After taking this course you will ___”.The more aspirational you can make this the better your course will sell I think. People like to aspire to be someone new.But this brings up a subtle point: what are the boundaries of who you believe you can become? How much personal transformation is possible? This is a very individual and personal question but an important one. As I begin to explore the research literature around this concept of agency I see there’s a term “bounded agency” which investigates personal agency as a complex interwoven set of dependencies:Bounded agency is a feature of actors’ engagements in the complex social ecologies of work, learning and social responsibility. The spaces in which human agency is exercised are regulated by professional bodies, through the setting of professional standards and by public policy, through the&nbsp; regulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; employment&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; and&nbsp; through&nbsp; wider&nbsp; systems&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; management of employment and government interventions directly targeted at the workplace.The development that takes place through the exercise of human agency is not that  of  the  self-propelled  autonomous  individual  but,  rather,  relational  and  profoundly social in nature. What binds us also contains affordances that enable us to think, feel and act.Karen Evans https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-60943-0_2🕹️And, surely, our sense of agency changes over time through our careers.As we’re emerging:Individual agency is not uniformly effective throughout the life course. It is less needed when individuals move on well-buffered and institutionally regulated paths, i.e. during primary and secondary school, after having decided for a study major (Heckhausen 2010; Heckhausen and Shane 2015), or when entering a well-supported vocational training program leading to relatively stable vocational careers. Individual agency is most needed at times of transition, when individuals leave a pre-structured path, such as at the end of compulsory schooling, when they enter a new path or field and are assuming new social roles.@SpringerLink https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40894-019-00111-3And later, submerging:Te Papa employs approximately 600 people. A percentage of these are long-standing professionals (across a range of practices) who are coming to the end of their full-time or paid working lives. The negotiation of the final period of your working life inside a museum is, I think, worthy of as much attention and support as that emerging / entry period. And yet it is something that is rarely discussed out loud. How to accommodate, enjoy the benefit of, and celebrate people who are late in their careers, who are going through family changes, health changes, financial changes, and for some a massive change in their identity, as they contemplate leaving a career (and sometimes a single institution) to which they have dedicated decades' of mental, physical and emotional energy. Not to mention the subtle (or unsubtle) pressure of the generations behind these people, who - frankly - want the jobs they currently hold.

  "content": "I’ve been trying to make sense of my work recently. Launching the SEO MBA kind of bifurcated my possible futures into “consulting” and “course creating” - different types of work with different kinds of audiences. My consulting work is with senior executives and founders while the SEO MBA is aimed at SEO professionals.How to reconcile these possible futures and possible selves?Through a bunch of conversations with close friends - maybe the common throughline is increasing agency.Specifically - the idea of increasing agency for people’s work selves. This feels promising as a potential north star because it neatly aligns with the big things I’m spending my time on:  Consulting work: My consulting work these days is mostly about two things - it’s about bringing strategic clarity to executives and helping organizations build new capabilities. My best client work involves very long engagements where I get to know my point of contact very well. This work blurs the boundaries between consulting and coaching. And it’s all about increasing agency - increasing the clarity and sense of forward momentum.  SEO MBA teaching: The courses I’ve built (especially the course on Executive Presence) help people increase their personal agency. It’s not really about teaching skills as much as it’s providing new vantage points and new ways of conducting yourself so that you can take on more senior work. There are plenty of stories of people taking the course and then getting a new job. This is more than just “upskilling” - it’s about increasing agency.  Indie consulting book: The core thesis for the book is how to build a sustainable independent consulting practice. And much of the writing is about how to maintain autonomy and agency despite pressures to standardize your work and narrow your focus. This is very much in line with an idea of “increasing agency for indie consultants”.So in effect you could argue that I’ve been focused on increasing agency for: executives, SEO professionals and indie consultants.Feels right. I certainly get a kick out of this kind of work.🕹️One of the first distinctions to tease apart is the difference between fulfilling work and high-agency work. From David MacIver with some great notes on fulfilling work:And there are aspects of employment I miss a great deal, even if there are other aspects that I do not miss at all.To me it feels like there's some sort of central human experience which has all of the following components:A group of people, working together on a problem.The problem has an actual (even if small) impact on the world.The problem is difficult and without working hard on it they will fail.All (or most) of the people in the group actually care about the problem and want to succeed.No member of the group could succeed at the problem on their own.Each member of the group is an active participant in the process, and the end result depends on how well they fulfill their role.Possibly this list isn't sufficient, but it all seems necessary to be an example of the thing I'm pointing to, which one might as well call something like \"fulfilling work\".David R. MacIver https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-17-09:08.htmlDavid goes on to suggest that work almost never meets these criteria, and that’s partly why chasing “fulfilling work” might be the wrong objective. Work with purpose and meaning sounds nice but might be impossible to reach? It’s not quite what I’m getting at with increasing agency.High-agency work is almost independent of work with purpose and meaning. Except my hunch is that these two concepts are actually deeply intertwined…More to unearth and think about.🕹️I sketched out this 2x2 for the kinds of “joy of work” that we might talk about. Just a sketch:Where:  High Skills / Inner World: This is the kind of raw skills of personal productivity. Within your own personal sphere can you optimize your ways of working? This might involve organizing your work, inbox zero, clearing up your calendar, etc. I think this kind of work is appealing when you’re early in your career because it doesn’t require anyone else giving you permission and can be done in almost any context. Level up your own personal systems as a way to control your work.  High Skills / Outer World: This is your ability to create systems of influence. To be able to improve the systems and processes around you. This is appealing as you get more senior and develop more “executive presence”. This kind of work scales all the way up to formal management roles where imposing clarity, systems, process and order onto teams and systems is appealing. Essentially, can you control the world around you?  High Meaning / Inner World: This is the idea of doing day to day work that is stimulating. Are the tasks in front of you energizing? If you like spending time in spreadsheets are you spending time in spreadsheets? If you like designing, are you spending time in Figma? This is where the concept of flow comes in - are you spending chunks of your day in enjoyable focused work.  High Meaning / Outer World: This is the big idea of “work with purpose” - fulfilling work that has meaning in the world around you. This has high ideals of purpose and doing good - but could also be measured as impact. Is the work you’re doing creating a tangible impact in the world?🕹️When you put together a course, you’re supposed to focus on the personal transformation, not the skills. Complete the phrase “After taking this course you will ___”.The more aspirational you can make this the better your course will sell I think. People like to aspire to be someone new.But this brings up a subtle point: what are the boundaries of who you believe you can become? How much personal transformation is possible?

  "title": "Rejecting Specialization",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/16/rejecting-specialization/",
  "date": "June 16, 2022",
  "content": "There are two types of indie consultants. There are those that have created a very clear specialization, you can look at their website and see something like “I help B2B SaaS companies with their content strategy” or “I help brands build audience via email”. The indie consultants that do this well seem very busy, well known and respected in their industry. It’s fairly easy to see from the outside what their work looks.Then there are those who are… weirder, less legible, harder to define. Folks who’s website doesn’t have a tight “I do X for Y”. These people likely project a weird sensibility via their online writing and persona, building a body of work that points to a kind of vibe.It’s easier to see from the outside when the first group is successful, and it’s fairly easy to imagine what the work looks like. The second group is much less legible. Are they successful? What kind of work do they even do?There are plenty of success stories for the first group - lots of books, articles, podcasts and case studies. If you read around you might think that you should follow in their footsteps, that this path is both more successful and easier.But I don’t buy it. I’ve been an indie consultant for 8 years and have built a network and community of fellow indies. I’ve had many open and honest private conversations with indies about money, success and anxiety. Through these conversations I’ve come to two realizations:  For many indie consultants who have rejected the 9-5 of full-time employment, trying to specialize and box yourself in is a path to burnout and failure  This second group of weird indie consultants is often just as successful as the first group (if not more so) - they’re just less vocal about itSo in this post I’m going to reject the commonly accepted wisdom and look at why specializing is hard, why it fails and what an alternative path looks like. The answer lies in developing strong opinions and a distinctive vibe.Specializing is “not even wrong”If you look around at common advice for indie consultants you’ll get told to specialize: to create a narrow definition of who you’re serving and what you offer.You might think something like: “If only I could clearly articulate WHO my ideal clients are and WHAT they want, then I could figure out how to drive leads”. There’s plenty of conventional wisdom that supports this idea. As Philip Morgan says in his book The Positioning Manual for Indie Consultants:  To get ahead with your consulting business, you need to create visibility in the market and earn enough trust to make selling easier. These two things, visibility and trust, are much easier to get if you SPECIALIZE in something, in some way.Philip is right about trust and visibility being important. Trust is important because we want senior clients primed for strategy work. Visibility is important because we need clients to know us and find us.But specializing? Philip isn’t exactly wrong about specializing - in theory specializing is the most viable way to create a steady stream of clients. But, in practice, I often see this path being the wrong option. The problem is that good specialization is exceptionally hard. And mediocre specialization has two core problems:  It attracts less senior, more tightly defined work that traps you in a mode of repeatable execution work  It puts you in a well defined box that grinds against your identityWe think that the primary function of positioning is for the market - for clients to better discover and hire you. But I’d argue that positioning is primarily for your own ego. It’s an inner game of figuring out who you feel comfortable being, more than a driver of clients.Specifically, many independent consultants are generalists - trying to find interesting,  senior work. They crave an escape from the narrow confines of 9-5, and it’s incredibly difficult to reconcile a narrow specialization with your quest to be a senior generalist. This is a classic failure mode that I see time and time again: generalist indie consultants trying to fit themselves into a narrow positioning just to try and manufacture clients and in the process causing themselves stress, anxiety and ultimately burn out.This anxiety is real. Feeling the peer pressure and established wisdom pushing you down a path to specialize - despite the fact that it grinds against your identity. You feel like you “should” do it. But I’d argue that for most indie consultants, you’d be better off leaning into your uniqueness and point of view as a way to generate senior clients consistently.Why is Specializing Hard?The problem with the advice to specialize is that it’s not even wrong! The advice is correct - IF you can create a narrow positioning, if you can become a visible, trusted expert in a particular niche then you will attract clients. It will solve your problems.But it’s a big IF…The advice is not even wrong because most independent consultants can’t create a narrow positioning. The problem is that we think choosing a specialization and positioning is based on looking at the intersection of work we’re good at and what the market wants.This is hard enough to do - especially in the early days of consulting when you don’t have enough work yet to really understand what you’re good at or what the market wants. But once you start to figure out some kind of product/market fit for your consulting you start to uncover a third, hidden agenda:This third agenda is why specializing can lead to burnout. We’re not just looking for product/market fit for our consulting work - but our consulting work is deeply tied to our identity and we need a way to make it sustainable. This third hidden question is why specializing is so hard and even impossible for many independent consultants. Even if you can choose a specialization that meets the top two circles - something that you are good at that the market wants - can you reconcile that with your sense of identity? Can you craft an identity that you feel comfortable with, that gives you energy? Are you comfortable with who you might become?  Example: The obvious and “correct” positioning for my own consulting work should have been some variation of SEO consulting. My history in the SEO industry meant that I had visibility and trust. I’d spoken at conferences all around the world, I’d worked with big brands.  But I also saw the SEO industry as a dead end for me personally. Not that SEO is doomed or irrelevant but it wasn’t the path I wanted to follow to ensure I was challenging myself, broadening my horizons and working on new creative challenges.  This led to a lot of internal angst. Should I follow the standard path and do the work that I’m well known for and can comfortably deliver? Ultimately I decided to iterate my way out of SEO - to take the familiar SEO work to pay the bills in the early days but to aggressively pursue bigger, more strategic and more creative kinds of work. It took me 1-2 years to feel like I’d really “escaped SEO” and was on a new path to new kinds of work.  This kind of internal angst is very common - there’s a clear path to follow but it’s known and well understood. And you didn’t set out as an independent to follow paths you’ve already walked…The biggest fear of independent consultants when specializing is not just that it will narrow your options - but that will take you down a path you already know.Many independent consultants are independent for a reason - we’re contrarian, we’re attracted to a myriad, varied array of work. We chase novelty and surprise - we’re often seeking an alternative path. And specialization doesn’t lend itself well to novelty and surprise.Instead, especially in the early days of consulting, you’re chasing the greatest possible surface area of distinct clients in an attempt to better understand the interplay of what you’re good at, what people will pay for and who you want to be.And it’s not just paying clients you’re chasing - you’re chasing senior clients paying good money for interesting work.The Hidden Price Ceiling of SpecializingGood specializing is hard, because if you don’t do it well, you can end up trapping yourself. By creating a narrow positioning or specialization you make yourself more legible and understandable - you’re essentially optimizing for well-defined work. And well-defined work is less senior, less well paid and less interesting.You can separate most work into two buckets: well-defined and ambiguous.Well defined work is the kind of recognizable work where the client has clarity around both the problem and solution. This is the kind of standardized work that you see agencies pitch - things like “content strategy”, “user research”, “SEO audit” or “website design”. Well defined work has clear naming and down this path you see work that has an RFP and multiple competing vendors. Well define work is won by tight positioning.Ambiguous work on the other hand is where either the problem or solution are not fully formed. Perhaps the client has a goal like “how do I expand my business into a new country?” but an unclear solution. Or perhaps they have a problem “growth has stalled for our agency” and lack clarity about both what is causing the problem AND what a solution would look like. Here the client doesn’t even know the shape of the work - so they need to rely on a kind of vibe to select the right consultant.This distinction between well-defined and ambiguous work has a lot of implications…            Well Defined Work      Ambiguous Work                  Client has clarity of problem and solution      Client lacks clarity on problem and/or solution              Requires strong positioning to capture      Requires vibes and point of view to capture              Feels like freelancing      Feels like a blend of coaching, consulting and advising              Standardized work with multiple competing vendors / agencies      Non-standard work often in non-competitive pitching situations              Lower hourly price point      Higher hourly price point              Less senior      More senior              Tends to be shorter / project based      More likely to lead to ongoing retainer              Requires clear case studies that show you’ve done this work before      Requires alignment between ways of working and view of the world              Clients can come from “cold” channels      Clients require warm intros and personal introductions              Able to be decomposed into tasks that a team can tackle (i.e. agency is a good fit)      Hard to decompose into tasks so a good fit for a single individual (i.e. consultant is a good fit)      In short, not only is ambiguous work more fun and interesting - but crucially, it’s more senior. If you want to push into more senior work with long term well paid retainers, then you need to push into ambiguous work.All Senior Work is AmbiguousA VP of product or a CMO doesn’t get that role just because they are an expert in product management or an expert in marketing. They get that role because in addition to some product or marketing expertise they also have a blend of senior skills - across communication, leadership, management, vision and the ability to get things done.As you get more senior, the focus and emphasis on narrow domain skills gets replaced with a more ambiguous blend of skills and expertise, a kind of executive presence.The problem with a carefully crafted positioning is that it typically makes the wrong part efficient - it makes it easier for clients to hire you for well defined work. It allows greater legibility, trust and expertise around work which is well defined.This is a trap that I see many indie consultants back themselves into - through creating a narrow positioning they end up optimizing for lower quality client work. They increase their dealflow for clients, but only for smaller, less valuable and less senior clients. This results in ending up delivering a lot of routine work. It can fill your pipeline but leave your soul empty.Instead, what senior clients want from a consulting engagement is not just skills or expertise, it’s experience and momentum. They need to move their org in a direction that it’s currently resisting - and so they look to outside help to kickstart a new direction and provide fresh energy and momentum to get something new off the ground. (This is capacity building consulting like I’ve talked about before).Great positioning, if you can pull it off, can lead to ambiguous workLet’s acknowledge that great positioning and specialization can lead to ambiguous work. It’s very rare to see this kind of specialization - it’s very much the exception, not the rule. But let’s take a look at an example.  Example: Andy Raskin is a consultant specializing in “strategic narrative”. His website says:      CEO ENGAGEMENTS: ALIGN YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM AROUND A STRATEGIC NARRATIVE        In these engagements, I help venture-backed CEOs and their leadership teams align around a high-level story that powers success—in sales, marketing, fundraising, product development and recruiting—by getting everyone on the same page about strategy and differentiation.    This is a rare breed of specializing - that allows you to both define a senior audience and define the work, while still leaving room to drive a bus through in terms of how this work is actually delivered. Note that Andy’s use of “strategic narrative” is essentially defining a proprietary approach and type of work.  You easily imagine how this specialization allows for senior, ambiguous work that leads to ongoing retainers - I can imagine how this strategic narrative impacts every part of the organization so it could easily lead to all kinds of work. But - you have to ask yourself carefully if you’re able to create this kind of senior and ambiguous specialization… Most can’t.  (And as we’ll see later much of Andy’s success is due to his strong opinions, not just his positioning)So, if we’re rejecting specialization and mediocre narrow positioning - how do we generate clients? Getting a steady pipeline of clients still requires trust and visibility - but we can understand it better through this lens of ambiguous, senior work.Specifically, clients need trust that you can navigate the ambiguity reliably without close supervision. And you need to be visible, not just publicly but inside their inner circles. After all this senior ambiguous work often flows through dark leads in cozy spaces.In the rest of this piece we’ll look at how strong opinions create the kind of trust and visibility required for senior, ambiguous work.Part 1: Strong OpinionsLet’s return to the goal: sustainable client leads for well paid work without sacrificing our personal identity or narrowing our focus.It turns out that having strong opinions with a distinctive vibe works remarkably well. Strong opinions:  Travel well - they’re designed for distribution and visibility in our networked age  Allow you to get good client/consultant fit for senior, ambiguous projects  Signal a creative energy that clients are looking for to catalyze change in their organizationBut, unlike specialization, strong opinions don’t narrow down your options or grind against your identity as a generalist. Strong opinions allow for divergent, generative futures.  Example: My friend and fellow independent Behzod has a background in user research and instead of creating a strong specialization he covers all kinds of work related to user research under his studio moniker Yet Another Studio.  He has strong opinions. He has developed a point of view on a contentious topic within the user research community - whether or not to democratize research. He takes a stand with a strong opinion: Democratization is our job.  This single piece (which started as a podcast talk, became a conference talk and then a blog post) has generated a ton of client work for him - leads that come to him well primed not for him to “do user research” but to “create a user research practice” - specifically the kind of senior, ambiguous work that is better paid and longer term than simply executing on a user research project.Let’s take a closer look at how this works:Publishing Strong Opinions Gives You VisibilityThis might seem obvious but it’s important to restate it: strong opinions are what distribution is made of. Every independent consultant should be working in public in some form - it’s how you generate awareness, clients and visibility.But working in public is more than just publishing content - it’s about creating connections. We’ve explored before how working in public leads to expanded connections and how content drives leads even from weak ties. Working in public, producing content is about creating connections. About shaping your image in other people’s eyes. It’s how you build friends, collaborators, advocates and clients.The key of course is to make content that’s memorable and distinctive. In short: content that has a point of view. Whether it’s a clearly articulated point of view with a rational argument or just an aesthetic and vibe.Not sure how to start? Small-b blogging and blogpunk make a powerful combination.How do you tell if you’re doing it right? As you build your publishing practice the only measure is connections. How many conversations are you having because of the things you publish? Forget audience size, forget pageviews - focus on crafting your voice. Focus on building a voice that makes people want to have a dialogue.When you make the leap from full time employment to being independent you leave behind a lot of the traditional forms of authority - platforms are harder to access. When I worked for Distilled, an SEO agency I was speaking at 20-30 conferences a year. Since being independent I’ve spoken at… 4 conferences in 8 years?Once the labels, platforms and access are taken away it’s much harder to create an audience, you need to create a voice for yourself.  Example: Lindsey Slaby is an independent consultant working on ambiguous and senior level consulting projects in the ad agency world. Lindsey specifically works at the messy areas that others shy away from: contracts, pricing, contracting, agency roster selection and more.  Over the years Lindsey has developed strong opinions about how the industry works, unafraid to shine a light on uncomfortable topics or take contrary positions. For example this piece on RFPs and why companies should be pitching agencies (when the received wisdom is that agencies should be pitching companies!)Vibe Fit and Trust in Navigating AmbiguityMore than raw distribution though, exposing your style and sensibility is important. Not just for standing out in the networks and generating dialogue and discussion - but also because senior, ambiguous consulting work relies on navigating a trust gap like no other.Having an opinion is like having taste. It demonstrates a sensibility and way of thinking that is key when a senior client is considering a consultant for a project.As we outlined in the defined/ambiguous section - ambiguous work requires an extreme amount of trust. When the situation is well defined - clients don’t need as much trust because they can control the situation more closely: they have a better understanding of what’s going on, they are able to hire replacement vendors easily and they can rely on outside experts more comfortably.For ambiguous work it’s not so easy. In this case the client is relying on the consultant to both diagnose the problem AND provide potential solutions. It’s often the case that the client is operating in unfamiliar territory and needs to simply trust the consultant in all kinds of ways. There’s no easy way to replace the consultant or verify the advice being given. Simply put, oftentimes the client (and sometimes consultant!) are operating outside of normal boundaries.So trust is essential - but more than that, you need to trust that the consultant will make the right decisions even faced with unknown unknowns. This kind of taste is hard to signal with a positioning statement. To develop this trust in someone without actively working with them before requires a strong understanding of the person’s point of view and vibe, which is why sharing your point of view in depth matters.Vibes &amp; Destabilizing EnergyMore than just trust however, ambiguous work requires a specific kind of energy. Consulting is about changing clients. You’re often an outsider, brought in to catalyze some kind of change that the client has been unable to change on their own. Playing this role of catalyst (or, said more strongly: destabilizer) is challenging. Push in the wrong direction and clients will reject you. Push too hard and the client will collapse into chaos.This delicate balance means that senior leaders need to know that you can put yourself in their shoes. Less like a vendor where they tell you what to do, and more like a peer that they can spar with.So prospective clients need to trust that you get not just how the industry works but how their specific culture functions. They are looking for a very specific kind of energy - enough energy to change and destabilize the org, to provoke the organization to change, to create momentum for new projects. But not the wrong kind of energy to tear the client’s organization apart - creating strife and disruption.In short, vibe is how you find a good client/consultant fit.Building vibes is a different kind of work from specializing. You’re not just demonstrating expertise and competence but compatibility.In optimism as an operating system we explore the human side of consulting and the common trap of the negative consultant. As you think about exposing your vibe you need to think carefully about how to develop opinions that have a point of view without positioning yourself with the wrong kind of destabilizing energy.So we’ve covered why specializing can be the wrong move, explored why having a point of view is useful for generating senior, ambiguous consulting work and why publishing and writing in public is the way to create a vibe that a client can trust and be compatible with.But how do you develop a point of view? And in particular how do you do it authentically without resorting to cheap shots and portraying the wrong kind of negative destabilizing energy for potential clients?Part 2: How to cultivate a point of viewDeveloping opinions is hard. Translating opinions into a credible point of view is even harder. Doing it without pissing people off is harder still!The good news is that, unlike specializing, developing opinions, crafting a point of view and building a vibe is an iterative, generative process - once you start trying out your voice there’s a feedback loop that helps you develop your voice and strengthen your point of view.It’s hard to see which parts of your experience and opinions are distinctive and resonate without sharing them. In my experience, it’s rarely the big grand vision that people are attracted to but rather something more mundane and grounded - something that has a clarity and weight about it that is distinctive.Let’s explore two different approaches to finding your voice and point of view: “20% beefs” and the gap between industry and practice.20% BeefsThis is a concept that Venkatesh created in his email newsletter Art of Gig. I’m quoting liberally from it because it’s no longer online (with Venkat’s permission):  The top 3 articles of the hundreds I’ve written, in terms of how much they drove cold inbound leads for consulting gigs, are the following. What feature do you think they have in common?      The Gervais Principle (2009): A dark/satirical take on office politics and corporate sociopathy that went hugely viral back in the day.    Entrepreneurs are the New Labor (2012): A cynical take on heroic valorization of founders, arguing that VCs are to founders as management to labor.    Fat thinking and Economies of Variety (2016): A post arguing for fat startups and messy, wasteful, play-like innovation over “lean” thinking.    It’s not that they are dark and satirical or contrarian. I’ve written other dark/satirical or contrarian things that led to no gigs.  It’s not that they showcase deep expertise in a subject. They don’t. In fact they largely showcase my shallow, self-taught amateurishness on the underlying topics.  It’s not that they offer step-by-step playbooks to solving the problems they frame. They don’t.  The correct answer is that they each pick a beef worth picking, but not too strongly.      The Gervais Principle picks a beef against feel-good “nice” management thinking that dominated the pop-business literature at the time (I helped drive the surge of interest in darker understandings of business circa 2009-12 I think).    Entrepreneurs are the New Labor picks a beef against people in the tech sector shilling what has come to be known as “hustle porn” and flattering founders with a Hero self-image that blinds them to industry dynamics and debilitating behaviors.    Fat Thinking picked a beef with the lean six-sigma crowd in big corporations, and the lean startup crowd in the startup scene.    But importantly, none of these is what you might call “pure beef” where the fight and criticism of an opposed perspective are the main focus or content.  They are what you might call “20% beef.” Where the starting point is rejecting some core sacred-cow axiom of a prevailing orthodoxy, and then building something new and interesting, based on additional ideas and novel elements, on that foundation of principled dissent. It is something like rejecting Euclid’s parallel line postulate and going out on a limb to see if you can build a non-Euclidean geometry.  For example, the assumptions I rejected in my 3 articles above are:      Executives are nice and managers know what they’re doing (Gervais Principle)    Entrepreneurs/founders are heroes (New Labor)    Efficiency and optimization are good things (Fat Thinking)    So one good answer to how to bootstrap from 0 to 1 is: indie consultants bootstrap with beefs. It’s not the only way, and it’s certainly not the safest way, but it’s a fun way that is very intellectually satisfying and validating when it works, and is the opposite of soul-destroying and dehumanizing.Venkatesh goes on to outline a bit of a “how-to”:  Discovering and developing a genuine beef into an artful calling card that lands you gigs is hard work. That’s why it’s a costly signal. You can’t fake it by simple bullshitting.  You have to put in the work of:      Spotting a widespread pattern of disillusionment in the margins    Identifying the prevailing orthodoxy driving the disillusionment    Analyzing its foundations    Rejecting one or more flawed premises driving the disillusionment    Adding imaginative alternative premises    Running with it to see where the whole thing can take you    Becoming conscious of what and who you’re for and against    Articulating it out there in public and standing behind it.    […] The work is hard not because it takes effort or time. None of those articles took me more than a couple of days to write. The work is hard because it takes a certain amount of courage and a good deal of taste. If you don’t feel a bit of an adrenaline rush, a sense of a fight-or-flight, a sense of burning bridges, while working on them, you’re not doing it right.20% beefs are like proof of experience - you can’t properly beef with an established way of thinking without first deeply understanding the orthodoxy. And I think this is the root of the power of 20% beefs - they demonstrate taste, point of view and experience all in one.You can see how this recipe from Venkatesh is literally a playbook that you can follow - first through observing your own consulting work and the disillusionment that exists in the margins (from clients, agencies, fellow consultants etc) and then later from trying out some light rejections of the orthodoxy - both in private (with clients and potential clients) and in public (by blogging).This line of inquiry is a healthy one for any consultant to take anyway - it’s the role of the consultant to play the fool and take contrary positions, ask stupid questions and check the first principles of everyone’s thinking.The Industry/Reality Gap20% beef is a recipe for developing a strong opinion - but it doesn’t really give you much insight into where to look. What kind of orthodoxy should you be analyzing and rejecting?Looking at successful examples of 20% beef we see that there’s a common theme of analyzing the gap between theory and industry. The unique vantage point that the consultant has is the vantage point across multiple clients - sometimes across multiple industries too.Through the nature of being embedded inside organizations, consultants often get a richer, closer look at how things are actually working. This enables you to develop a more realistic view of “how things work” than either in-house folks (who get to see inside a limited number of companies) and agencies (who only get to see the surface level of their clients).Behzod’s example of “democratization is our job” was developed from first seeing how research operated inside Facebook and Slack and then from consulting with a range of other startups. It’s this view of “how things actually are” that allowed him to develop a beef.Similarly, Lindsay Slaby’s perspective of “clients should pitch agencies” was developed from deep experience seeing how pitches actually work, and how much clients struggle to attract top quality talent - directly straddling the client/in-house divide and seeing the challenges from both sides.In every industry there’s typically some kind of received wisdom that sounds like good rational advice but simply doesn’t hold up when faced with reality.The trick is to look for advice that is “not even wrong” - advice that is correct in a certain sense but fundamentally unhelpful when applied to reality.The consultant occupies a unique position being able to see both across multiple clients AND to see further inside client organizations than agencies can. By embedding yourself deeply inside client organizations and working with senior leaders you can see the real challenges they face and how they behave - you can get underneath the surface of “good sounding but useless” advice.  Here’s a simple example to illustrate the point. In the SEO industry the commonly accepted way of delivering SEO work is via SEO audits. It doesn’t take a genius to observe these SEO audits in practice to see that they’re commonly less than worthless.  Not only has every sufficiently large organization already received several SEO audits in the past from a variety of agencies and vendors but an SEO audit is also not the most effective way to drive change and achieve SEO goals. You can see how you could construct a 20% beef perspective for the SEO industry via rejecting SEO audits as a way of delivering work.ConclusionIn conclusion, while the commonly accepted wisdom is to choose a niche and specialize, for many indie consultants it can be the wrong choice because:  Specializing often optimizes for well defined work, which is less senior, less well paid and less interesting  Specializing can grind against your identity as a generalistBecause of this, I’ve seen many indie consultants burn out trying too hard to fit themselves into a niche. Instead, developing a point of view and signaling a vibe can be more effective because:  It optimizes for ambiguous, senior, well-paid work that is more interesting  It doesn’t box you into a single identity  You can iterate and explore your way towards a point of viewDeveloping a point of view is a long journey, and it’s not easy. But it’s a more forgiving path than specializing. Recently I’ve been toying with the idea of phases for indie consulting and you can see how the various phases align with how you notice, develop and share your point of view:            Year      Phase      Steer by      Find clients by      Point of view                  0      Zero to one      Sending invoices for any kind of work      Any means necessary      Put all your work in one place and try and make sense of it              1-2      Getting started      Experimentation, figuring out your product / market / identity fit      Being visible, starting a newsletter/blog, joining networks      Notice what parts of your work and opinions make clients pay attention              3-4      Finding stability      Cash freedom, number of good clients      Beginning of POV development, writing around your topics, finding peers      Writing consistently in public on topics you’re energized by              5+      Finding freedom      Cash AND calendar freedom      Direct POV development, starting communities      2,000 word essays on POV      And don’t forget to stay weird and foolish."

  "content": "There are two types of indie consultants. There are those that have created a very clear specialization, you can look at their website and see something like “I help B2B SaaS companies with their content strategy” or “I help brands build audience via email”. The indie consultants that do this well seem very busy, well known and respected in their industry. It’s fairly easy to see from the outside what their work looks.Then there are those who are… weirder, less legible, harder to define. Folks who’s website doesn’t have a tight “I do X for Y”. These people likely project a weird sensibility via their online writing and persona, building a body of work that points to a kind of vibe.It’s easier to see from the outside when the first group is successful, and it’s fairly easy to imagine what the work looks like. The second group is much less legible. Are they successful? What kind of work do they even do?There are plenty of success stories for the first group - lots of books, articles, podcasts and case studies. If you read around you might think that you should follow in their footsteps, that this path is both more successful and easier.But I don’t buy it. I’ve been an indie consultant for 8 years and have built a network and community of fellow indies. I’ve had many open and honest private conversations with indies about money, success and anxiety. Through these conversations I’ve come to two realizations:  For many indie consultants who have rejected the 9-5 of full-time employment, trying to specialize and box yourself in is a path to burnout and failure  This second group of weird indie consultants is often just as successful as the first group (if not more so) - they’re just less vocal about itSo in this post I’m going to reject the commonly accepted wisdom and look at why specializing is hard, why it fails and what an alternative path looks like. The answer lies in developing strong opinions and a distinctive vibe.Specializing is “not even wrong”If you look around at common advice for indie consultants you’ll get told to specialize: to create a narrow definition of who you’re serving and what you offer.You might think something like: “If only I could clearly articulate WHO my ideal clients are and WHAT they want, then I could figure out how to drive leads”. There’s plenty of conventional wisdom that supports this idea. As Philip Morgan says in his book The Positioning Manual for Indie Consultants:  To get ahead with your consulting business, you need to create visibility in the market and earn enough trust to make selling easier. These two things, visibility and trust, are much easier to get if you SPECIALIZE in something, in some way.Philip is right about trust and visibility being important. Trust is important because we want senior clients primed for strategy work. Visibility is important because we need clients to know us and find us.But specializing? Philip isn’t exactly wrong about specializing - in theory specializing is the most viable way to create a steady stream of clients. But, in practice, I often see this path being the wrong option. The problem is that good specialization is exceptionally hard. And mediocre specialization has two core problems:  It attracts less senior, more tightly defined work that traps you in a mode of repeatable execution work  It puts you in a well defined box that grinds against your identityWe think that the primary function of positioning is for the market - for clients to better discover and hire you. But I’d argue that positioning is primarily for your own ego. It’s an inner game of figuring out who you feel comfortable being, more than a driver of clients.Specifically, many independent consultants are generalists - trying to find interesting,  senior work. They crave an escape from the narrow confines of 9-5, and it’s incredibly difficult to reconcile a narrow specialization with your quest to be a senior generalist. This is a classic failure mode that I see time and time again: generalist indie consultants trying to fit themselves into a narrow positioning just to try and manufacture clients and in the process causing themselves stress, anxiety and ultimately burn out.This anxiety is real. Feeling the peer pressure and established wisdom pushing you down a path to specialize - despite the fact that it grinds against your identity. You feel like you “should” do it. But I’d argue that for most indie consultants, you’d be better off leaning into your uniqueness and point of view as a way to generate senior clients consistently.Why is Specializing Hard?The problem with the advice to specialize is that it’s not even wrong! The advice is correct - IF you can create a narrow positioning, if you can become a visible, trusted expert in a particular niche then you will attract clients. It will solve your problems.But it’s a big IF…The advice is not even wrong because most independent consultants can’t create a narrow positioning. The problem is that we think choosing a specialization and positioning is based on looking at the intersection of work we’re good at and what the market wants.This is hard enough to do - especially in the early days of consulting when you don’t have enough work yet to really understand what you’re good at or what the market wants. But once you start to figure out some kind of product/market fit for your consulting you start to uncover a third, hidden agenda:This third agenda is why specializing can lead to burnout. We’re not just looking for product/market fit for our consulting work - but our consulting work is deeply tied to our identity and we need a way to make it sustainable. This third hidden question is why specializing is so hard and even impossible for many independent consultants. Even if you can choose a specialization that meets the top two circles - something that you are good at that the market wants - can you reconcile that with your sense of identity? Can you craft an identity that you feel comfortable with, that gives you energy? Are you comfortable with who you might become?  Example: The obvious and “correct” positioning for my own consulting work should have been some variation of SEO consulting. My history in the SEO industry meant that I had visibility and trust. I’d spoken at conferences all around the world, I’d worked with big brands.  But I also saw the SEO industry as a dead end for me personally. Not that SEO is doomed or irrelevant but it wasn’t the path I wanted to follow to ensure I was challenging myself, broadening my horizons and working on new creative challenges.  This led to a lot of internal angst. Should I follow the standard path and do the work that I’m well known for and can comfortably deliver? Ultimately I decided to iterate my way out of SEO - to take the familiar SEO work to pay the bills in the early days but to aggressively pursue bigger, more strategic and more creative kinds of work. It took me 1-2 years to feel like I’d really “escaped SEO” and was on a new path to new kinds of work.  This kind of internal angst is very common - there’s a clear path to follow but it’s known and well understood. And you didn’t set out as an independent to follow paths you’ve already walked…The biggest fear of independent consultants when specializing is not just that it will narrow your options - but that will take you down a path you already know.Many independent consultants are independent for a reason - we’re contrarian, we’re attracted to a myriad, varied array of work. We chase novelty and surprise - we’re often seeking an alternative path. And specialization doesn’t lend itself well to novelty and surprise.Instead, especially in the early days of consulting, you’re chasing the greatest possible surface area of distinct clients in an attempt to better understand the interplay of what you’re good at, what people will pay for and who you want to be.And it’s not just paying clients you’re chasing - you’re chasing senior clients paying good money for interesting work.The Hidden Price Ceiling of SpecializingGood specializing is hard, because if you don’t do it well, you can end up trapping yourself. By creating a narrow positioning or specialization you make yourself more legible and understandable - you’re essentially optimizing for well-defined work. And well-defined work is less senior, less well paid and less interesting.You can separate most work into two buckets: well-defined and ambiguous.Well defined work is the kind of recognizable work where the client has clarity around both the problem and solution. This is the kind of standardized work that you see agencies pitch - things like “content strategy”, “user research”, “SEO audit” or “website design”. Well defined work has clear naming and down this path you see work that has an RFP and multiple competing vendors. Well define work is won by tight positioning.Ambiguous work on the other hand is where either the problem or solution are not fully formed. Perhaps the client has a goal like “how do I expand my business into a new country?” but an unclear solution. Or perhaps they have a problem “growth has stalled for our agency” and lack clarity about both what is causing the problem AND what a solution would look like. Here the client doesn’t even know the shape of the work - so they need to rely on a kind of vibe to select the right consultant.This distinction between well-defined and ambiguous work has a lot of implications…            Well Defined Work      Ambiguous Work                  Client has clarity of problem and solution      Client lacks clarity on problem and/or solution              Requires strong positioning to capture      Requires vibes and point of view to capture              Feels like freelancing      Feels like a blend of coaching, consulting and advising              Standardized work with multiple competing vendors / agencies      Non-standard work often in non-competitive pitching situations              Lower hourly price point      Higher hourly price point              Less senior      More senior              Tends to be shorter / project based      More likely to lead to ongoing retainer              Requires clear case studies that show you’ve done this work before      Requires alignment between ways of working and view of the world              Clients can come from “cold” channels      Clients require warm intros and personal introductions              Able to be decomposed into tasks that a team can tackle (i.e. agency is a good fit)      Hard to decompose into tasks so a good fit for a single individual (i.e. consultant is a good fit)      In short, not only is ambiguous work more fun and interesting - but crucially, it’s more senior. If you want to push into more senior work with long term well paid retainers, then you need to push into ambiguous work.All Senior Work is AmbiguousA VP of product or a CMO doesn’t get that role just because they are an expert in product management or an expert in marketing. They get that role because in addition to some product or marketing expertise they also have a blend of senior skills - across communication, leadership, management, vision and the ability to get things done.As you get more senior, the focus and emphasis on narrow domain skills gets replaced with a more ambiguous blend of skills and expertise, a kind of executive presence.The problem with a carefully crafted positioning is that it typically makes the wrong part efficient - it makes it easier for clients to hire you for well defined work. It allows greater legibility, trust and expertise around work which is well defined.This is a trap that I see many indie consultants back themselves into - through creating a narrow positioning they end up optimizing for lower quality client work. They increase their dealflow for clients, but only for smaller, less valuable and less senior clients. This results in ending up delivering a lot of routine work. It can fill your pipeline but leave your soul empty.Instead, what senior clients want from a consulting engagement is not just skills or expertise, it’s experience and momentum. They need to move their org in a direction that it’s currently resisting - and so they look to outside help to kickstart a new direction and provide fresh energy and momentum to get something new off the ground. (This is capacity building consulting like I’ve talked about before).Great positioning, if you can pull it off, can lead to ambiguous workLet’s acknowledge that great positioning and specialization can lead to ambiguous work. It’s very rare to see this kind of specialization - it’s very much the exception, not the rule. But let’s take a look at an example.  Example: Andy Raskin is a consultant specializing in “strategic narrative”. His website says:      CEO ENGAGEMENTS: ALIGN YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM AROUND A STRATEGIC NARRATIVE        In these engagements, I help venture-backed CEOs and their leadership teams align around a high-level story that powers success—in sales, marketing, fundraising, product development and recruiting—by getting everyone on the same page about strategy and differentiation.    This is a rare breed of specializing - that allows you to both define a senior audience and define the work, while still leaving room to drive a bus through in terms of how this work is actually delivered. Note that Andy’s use of “strategic narrative” is essentially defining a proprietary approach and type of work.  You easily imagine how this specialization allows for senior, ambiguous work that leads to ongoing retainers - I can imagine how this strategic narrative impacts every part of the organization so it could easily lead to all kinds of work. But - you have to ask yourself carefully if you’re able to create this kind of senior and ambiguous specialization… Most can’t.  (And as we’ll see later much of Andy’s success is due to his strong opinions, not just his positioning)So, if we’re rejecting specialization and mediocre narrow positioning - how do we generate clients? Getting a steady pipeline of clients still requires trust and visibility - but we can understand it better through this lens of ambiguous, senior work.Specifically, clients need trust that you can navigate the ambiguity reliably without close supervision. And you need to be visible, not just publicly but inside their inner circles. After all this senior ambiguous work often flows through dark leads in cozy spaces.In the rest of this piece we’ll look at how strong opinions create the kind of trust and visibility required for senior, ambiguous work.Part 1: Strong OpinionsLet’s return to the goal: sustainable client leads for well paid work without sacrificing our personal identity or narrowing our focus.It turns out that having strong opinions with a distinctive vibe works remarkably well. Strong opinions:  Travel well - they’re designed for distribution and visibility in our networked age  Allow you to get good client/consultant fit for senior, ambiguous projects  Signal a creative energy that clients are looking for to catalyze change in their organizationBut, unlike specialization, strong opinions don’t narrow down your options or grind against your identity as a generalist. Strong opinions allow for divergent, generative futures.  Example: My friend and fellow independent Behzod has a background in user research and instead of creating a strong specialization he covers all kinds of work related to user research under his studio moniker Yet Another Studio.  He has strong opinions. He has developed a point of view on a contentious topic within the user research community - whether or not to democratize research. He takes a stand with a strong opinion: Democratization is our job.  This single piece (which started as a podcast talk, became a conference talk and then a blog post) has generated a ton of client work for him - leads that come to him well primed not for him to “do user research” but to “create a user research practice” - specifically the kind of senior, ambiguous work that is better paid and longer term than simply executing on a user research project.Let’s take a closer look at how this works:Publishing Strong Opinions Gives You VisibilityThis might seem obvious but it’s important to restate it: strong opinions are what distribution is made of. Every independent consultant should be working in public in some form - it’s how you generate awareness, clients and visibility.But working in public is more than just publishing content - it’s about creating connections. We’ve explored before how working in public leads to expanded connections and how content drives leads even from weak ties. Working in public, producing content is about creating connections. About shaping your image in other people’s eyes. It’s how you build friends, collaborators, advocates and clients.The key of course is to make content that’s memorable and distinctive. In short: content that has a point of view. Whether it’s a clearly articulated point of view with a rational argument or just an aesthetic and vibe.Not sure how to start? Small-b blogging and blogpunk make a powerful combination.How do you tell if you’re doing it right? As you build your publishing practice the only measure is connections. How many conversations are you having because of the things you publish? Forget audience size, forget pageviews - focus on crafting your voice. Focus on building a voice that makes people want to have a dialogue.When you make the leap from full time employment to being independent you leave behind a lot of the traditional forms of authority - platforms are harder to access. When I worked for Distilled, an SEO agency I was speaking at 20-30 conferences a year. Since being independent I’ve spoken at… 4 conferences in 8 years?Once the labels, platforms and access are taken away it’s much harder to create an audience, you need to create a voice for yourself.  Example: Lindsey Slaby is an independent consultant working on ambiguous and senior level consulting projects in the ad agency world. Lindsey specifically works at the messy areas that others shy away from: contracts, pricing, contracting, agency roster selection and more.  Over the years Lindsey has developed strong opinions about how the industry works, unafraid to shine a light on uncomfortable topics or take contrary positions. For example this piece on RFPs and why companies should be pitching agencies (when the received wisdom is that agencies should be pitching companies!)Vibe Fit and Trust in Navigating AmbiguityMore than raw distribution though, exposing your style and sensibility is important. Not just for standing out in the networks and generating dialogue and discussion - but also because senior, ambiguous consulting work relies on navigating a trust gap like no other.Having an opinion is like having taste. It demonstrates a sensibility and way of thinking that is key when a senior client is considering a consultant for a project.As we outlined in the defined/ambiguous section - ambiguous work requires an extreme amount of trust. When the situation is well defined - clients don’t need as much trust because they can control the situation more closely: they have a better understanding of what’s going on, they are able to hire replacement vendors easily and they can rely on outside experts more comfortably.For ambiguous work it’s not so easy. In this case the client is relying on the consultant to both diagnose the problem AND provide potential solutions. It’s often the case that the client is operating in unfamiliar territory and needs to simply trust the consultant in all kinds of ways. There’s no easy way to replace the consultant or verify the advice being given. Simply put, oftentimes the client (and sometimes consultant!) are operating outside of normal boundaries.So trust is essential - but more than that, you need to trust that the consultant will make the right decisions even faced with unknown unknowns. This kind of taste is hard to signal with a positioning statement. To develop this trust in someone without actively working with them before requires a strong understanding of the person’s point of view and vibe, which is why sharing your point of view in depth matters.Vibes &amp; Destabilizing EnergyMore than just trust however, ambiguous work requires a specific kind of energy. Consulting is about changing clients. You’re often an outsider, brought in to catalyze some kind of change that the client has been unable to change on their own. Playing this role of catalyst (or, said more strongly: destabilizer) is challenging. Push in the wrong direction and clients will reject you. Push too hard and the client will collapse into chaos.This delicate balance means that senior leaders need to know that you can put yourself in their shoes. Less like a vendor where they tell you what to do, and more like a peer that they can spar with.So prospective clients need to trust that you get not just how the industry works but how their specific culture functions. They are looking for a very specific kind of energy - enough energy to change and destabilize the org, to provoke the organization to change, to create momentum for new projects. But not the wrong kind of energy to tear the client’s organization apart - creating strife and disruption.In short, vibe is how you find a good client/consultant fit.Building vibes is a different kind of work from specializing. You’re not just demonstrating expertise and competence but compatibility.In optimism as an operating system we explore the human side of consulting and the common trap of the negative consultant. As you think about exposing your vibe you need to think carefully about how to develop opinions that have a point of view without positioning yourself with the wrong kind of destabilizing energy.So we’ve covered why specializing can be the wrong move, explored why having a point of view is useful for generating senior, ambiguous consulting work and why publishing and writing in public is the way to create a vibe that a client can trust and be compatible with.But how do you develop a point of view? And in particular how do you do it authentically without resorting to cheap shots and portraying the wrong kind of negative destabilizing energy for potential clients?Part 2: How to cultivate a point of viewDeveloping opinions is hard. Translating opinions into a credible point of view is even harder. Doing it without pissing people off is harder still!The good news is that, unlike specializing, developing opinions, crafting a point of view and building a vibe is an iterative, generative process - once you start trying out your voice there’s a feedback loop that helps you develop your voice and strengthen your point of view.It’s hard to see which parts of your experience and opinions are distinctive and resonate without sharing them. In my experience, it’s rarely the big grand vision that people are attracted to but rather something more mundane and grounded - something that has a clarity and weight about it that is distinctive.Let’s explore two different approaches to finding your voice and point of view: “20% beefs” and the gap between industry and practice.20% BeefsThis is a concept that Venkatesh created in his email newsletter Art of Gig. I’m quoting liberally from it because it’s no longer online (with Venkat’s permission):  The top 3 articles of the hundreds I’ve written, in terms of how much they drove cold inbound leads for consulting gigs, are the following. What feature do you think they have in common?      The Gervais Principle (2009): A dark/satirical take on office politics and corporate sociopathy that went hugely viral back in the day.    Entrepreneurs are the New Labor (2012): A cynical take on heroic valorization of founders, arguing that VCs are to founders as management to labor.    Fat thinking and Economies of Variety (2016): A post arguing for fat startups and messy, wasteful, play-like innovation over “lean” thinking.    It’s not that they are dark and satirical or contrarian. I’ve written other dark/satirical or contrarian things that led to no gigs.  It’s not that they showcase deep expertise in a subject. They don’t. In fact they largely showcase my shallow, self-taught amateurishness on the underlying topics.  It’s not that they offer step-by-step playbooks to solving the problems they frame. They don’t.  The correct answer is that they each pick a beef worth picking, but not too strongly.      The Gervais Principle picks a beef against feel-good “nice” management thinking that dominated the pop-business literature at the time (I helped drive the surge of interest in darker understandings of business circa 2009-12 I think).    Entrepreneurs are the New Labor picks a beef against people in the tech sector shilling what has come to be known as “hustle porn” and flattering founders with a Hero self-image that blinds them to industry dynamics and debilitating behaviors.    Fat Thinking picked a beef with the lean six-sigma crowd in big corporations, and the lean startup crowd in the startup scene.    But importantly, none of these is what you might call “pure beef” where the fight and criticism of an opposed perspective are the main focus or content.  They are what you might call “20% beef.” Where the starting point is rejecting some core sacred-cow axiom of a prevailing orthodoxy, and then building something new and interesting, based on additional ideas and novel elements, on that foundation of principled dissent. It is something like rejecting Euclid’s parallel line postulate and going out on a limb to see if you can build a non-Euclidean geometry.  For example, the assumptions I rejected in my 3 articles above are:      Executives are nice and managers know what they’re doing (Gervais Principle)    Entrepreneurs/founders are heroes (New Labor)    Efficiency and optimization are good things (Fat Thinking)    So one good answer to how to bootstrap from 0 to 1 is: indie consultants bootstrap with beefs. It’s not the only way, and it’s certainly not the safest way, but it’s a fun way that is very intellectually satisfying and validating when it works, and is the opposite of soul-destroying and dehumanizing.Venkatesh goes on to outline a bit of a “how-to”:  Discovering and developing a genuine beef into an artful calling card that lands you gigs is hard work. That’s why it’s a costly signal. You can’t fake it by simple bullshitting.  You have to put in the work of:      Spotting a widespread pattern of disillusionment in the margins    Identifying the prevailing orthodoxy driving the disillusionment    Analyzing its foundations    Rejecting one or more flawed premises driving the disillusionment    Adding imaginative alternative premises    Running with it to see where the whole thing can take you    Becoming conscious of what and who you’re for and against    Articulating it out there in public and standing behind it.    […] The work is hard not because it takes effort or time. None of those articles took me more than a couple of days to write. The work is hard because it takes a certain amount of courage and a good deal of taste. If you don’t feel a bit of an adrenaline rush, a sense of a fight-or-flight, a sense of burning bridges, while working on them, you’re not doing it right.20% beefs are like proof of experience - you can’t properly beef with an established way of thinking without first deeply understanding the orthodoxy. And I think this is the root of the power of 20% beefs - they demonstrate taste, point of view and experience all in one.You can see how this recipe from Venkatesh is literally a playbook that you can follow - first through observing your own consulting work and the disillusionment that exists in the margins (from clients, agencies, fellow consultants etc) and then later from trying out some light rejections of the orthodoxy - both in private (with clients and potential clients) and in public (by blogging).This line of inquiry is a healthy one for any consultant to take anyway - it’s the role of the consultant to play the fool and take contrary positions, ask stupid questions and check the first principles of everyone’s thinking.The Industry/Reality Gap20% beef is a recipe for developing a strong opinion - but it doesn’t really give you much insight into where to look. What kind of orthodoxy should you be analyzing and rejecting?Looking at successful examples of 20% beef we see that there’s a common theme of analyzing the gap between theory and industry. The unique vantage point that the consultant has is the vantage point across multiple clients - sometimes across multiple industries too.Through the nature of being embedded inside organizations, consultants often get a richer, closer look at how things are actually working. This enables you to develop a more realistic view of “how things work” than either in-house folks (who get to see inside a limited number of companies) and agencies (who only get to see the surface level of their clients).Behzod’s example of “democratization is our job” was developed from first seeing how research operated inside Facebook and Slack and then from consulting with a range of other startups. It’s this view of “how things actually are” that allowed him to develop a beef.Similarly, Lindsay Slaby’s perspective of “clients should pitch agencies” was developed from deep experience seeing how pitches actually work, and how much clients struggle to attract top quality talent - directly straddling the client/in-house divide and seeing the challenges from both sides.In every industry there’s typically some kind of received wisdom that sounds like good rational advice but simply doesn’t hold up when faced with reality.The trick is to look for advice that is “not even wrong” - advice that is correct in a certain sense but fundamentally unhelpful when applied to reality.The consultant occupies a unique position being able to see both across multiple clients AND to see further inside client organizations than agencies can. By embedding yourself deeply inside client organizations and working with senior leaders you can see the real challenges they face and how they behave - you can get underneath the surface of “good sounding but useless” advice.  Here’s a simple example to illustrate the point. In the SEO industry the commonly accepted way of delivering SEO work is via SEO audits. It doesn’t take a genius to observe these SEO audits in practice to see that they’re commonly less than worthless.  Not only has every sufficiently large organization already received several SEO audits in the past from a variety of agencies and vendors but an SEO audit is also not the most effective way to drive change and achieve SEO goals. You can see how you could construct a 20% beef perspective for the SEO industry via rejecting SEO audits as a way of delivering work.ConclusionIn conclusion, while the commonly accepted wisdom is to choose a niche and specialize, for many indie consultants it can be the wrong choice because:  Specializing often optimizes for well defined work, which is less senior, less well paid and less interesting  Specializing can grind against your identity as a generalistBecause of this, I’ve seen many indie consultants burn out trying too hard to fit themselves into a niche. Instead, developing a point of view and signaling a vibe can be more effective because:  It optimizes for ambiguous, senior, well-paid work that is more interesting  It doesn’t box you into a single identity  You can iterate and explore your way towards a point of viewDeveloping a point of view is a long journey, and it’s not easy. But it’s a more forgiving path than specializing. Recently I’ve been toying with the idea of phases for indie consulting and you can see how the various phases align with how you notice, develop and share your point of view:            Year      Phase      Steer by      Find clients by      Point of view                  0      Zero to one      Sending invoices for any kind of work      Any means necessary      Put all your work in one place and try and make sense of it              1-2      Getting started      Experimentation, figuring out your product / market / identity fit      Being visible, starting a newsletter/blog, joining networks      Notice what parts of your work and opinions make clients pay attention              3-4      Finding stability      Cash freedom, number of good clients      Beginning of POV development, writing around your topics, finding peers      Writing consistently in public on topics you’re energized by              5+      Finding freedom      Cash AND calendar freedom      Direct POV development, starting communities      2,000 word essays on POV      And don’t forget to stay weird and foolish."

  "date": "June 10, 2022",
  "content": "I use Podia to host my SEO MBA courses and I love it. I chose Podia because they seemed to have the best student UX on the market.Clean, simple and easy to use. Perfect.I’m very happy with Podia - but here’s a list of random feature requests that I’d like to see in the future:1. Email 2.0Email needs a big overhaul. Not only has the setup bitten me in the ass a few times but it’s also confusing to use. For example:  When I enroll people manually in my course, I didn’t realize that they don’t enroll in the email series. There’s apparently no way to fix this.  When a user receives the last email in a sequence they exit the campaign. So if you add more emails later on they won’t receive them.Some wishlist items:  The workflow for email automation is terrifying. I have to pause the whole thing in order to edit it and the confirmation message always seems to suggest I’m about to send 100s of emails (when in reality it’s telling me how many people match the entry criteria).  Email layout and design isn’t great - and unless you’re really careful with images it breaks mobile layouts.  The CMS for editing and sending emails is very basic.Ideally I’d like to be able to use Podia to both run my free newsletter (currently on Substack) as well as mini email courses all the way up to full advanced workflows, segmentation and activation via email for customers.2. Course Tiers &amp; Gated ContentI sell my courses with two tiers to offer perks and add-ons. This requires a bit of a workaround inside Podia.Ideally there would be some way to add content to a course that is only available as an add-on or premium access. This would both make it easier to make the course (making the course once inside Podia) but might also offer a natural up-sell opportunity.In addition to this - upgrade pricing would be great. Being able to change the price of a product based on whether they already purchased something. Right now I have a total hack solution for this (requiring Stripe payment)….3. Make Certificate Completion ConditionalRight now, if you watch all the videos you get a certificate. Ideally I’d like the option to make receiving a certificate conditional on submitting an assignment or something. This would help the certificate mean something, and would encourage assignment completion.4. Lightweight CRMThere’s very little information about each customer. Ideally I’d be able to see a bit more information about:  Where they came from  Their site &amp; course usage / comments  What emails they’re subscribed to / received  Maybe a notes field so I can make notes on the backend like “Paid via Stripe 6/10 manually enrolled”5. Company EnrollmentSince my course is targeted at business users and businesses I have a lot of users expensing the course. Some feature requests for selling to businesses:  I spend a lot of time manually recreating invoices so that customers can have an invoice that shows the info they need (typically biz address and tax info)  The ability to whitelist a domain - i.e. let anyone with an @companyX.com domain enroll in a course.  It would be nice to have a feature where you can purchase multiple seats in a course and then delegate the access to a list of email addresses. Right now this all happens manually (payment via Stripe, get list of email addresses, enroll each one individually) - and note how when I do this all of those people never receive the email automation series :(6. Live Cohort CoursesMaven seems to be doing well. It would be great to have the ability to run a cohort based live course via Podia. Especially if it integrates with existing videos / course materials so folks have access to that too.Right now you can sell access to a webinar but a full live cohort course would be great (esp if it comes with a community too!)7. Affiliate Codes for Custom SitesThis is a minor quibble but affiliate codes only work if you send traffic to a Podia hosted site, but I send 100% of my traffic through my own custom built landing pages. It would be great if affiliate codes could work there too.8. Community Access for CoursesRight now, you can bundle access to a course for people that buy access to a community. But you can’t do the reverse. I’d like the ability to have a community hosted on Podia that is open to everyone who’s purchased one of the courses. But right now I can’t do that.9. DMCA &amp; Scraper SupportThere’s a bunch of platforms that scrape courses and re-sell them on the black market. I’d love some kind of automated detection of scraped course content and maybe like an easy copy/paste DMCA letter or something that you can send out. Would make playing whack-a-mole with these folks easier….Anyway - despite all that I’ve had a great experience with Podia, I’d def recommend them."

  "title": "A map for indie living",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/03/indie-consulting-map/",
  "date": "June 3, 2022",
  "content": "I’ve got a few friends on the cusp of independent life, either just about to leap into the unknown or already quit and they’re trying to figure it out.So here’s a half-baked thesis and possible blueprint for navigating indie life.🧭 🗺️ 🧭First, some core assumptions and insights:1. Consulting can build cash freedomPeople get an allergic reaction to the label “consulting” 1 but I’d like to argue that trading time for money is a great economic tool. It provides you cash leverage to pursue all kinds of other things.For that reason, and because it’s what I know, consulting and client work features heavily here. You do you. But bear in mind that “client work” / freelancing / consulting comes in many different guises.In particular, as you get more senior there are ways to do consulting work that don’t ruin your headspace. I wrote about that in my piece Sparring &amp; Tenure for Indie Consultants. Not all kinds of work have the same headspace, stress and time commitment.It can be a real failure mode to try and “start a startup” and “do some consulting” at the same time. Trying to balance these two competing types of work is extremely stressful and difficult.Instead, view consulting work (i.e. freelance work) as a way to stabilize cash flow, build a cash war-chest and leverage into higher order forms of consulting that are high $$ while low headspace (like sparring). Getting to a point where you can do client projects with high revenue and clear time boxed availability is the necessary freedom you need to be able to also build a startup / write a book / build a project that might have real equity.Consulting builds no equity, but it builds cash and calendar freedom to be able to build something that has equity without having to take on debt.2. Positioning is for the ego, not for the marketI’ve got a full post in draft about this, but in short - it’s more important to find a way to be visible, with a distinct vibe, rather than craft a tight positioning (“I am an X for Y” or “I do XYZ for companies like ABC”). You think positioning is important but it’s just for your own sense of self-narrative and identity. Which by the way is important!Paul Millerd captured this as don’t find a niche, find a mode and Venkatesh articulated as find a streak not a niche.So, you have to find a mode, or a streak. It’s easier and more valuable than crafting a tight positioning.But - your identity and self-narrative is important! So you should also craft some narrative aircover. This is some kind of project, website, initiative that you can lean on during the early days of figuring out indie life. Before you have a stable, real sense of how you’re making money or even WTF you’re doing you want some narrative aircover. There’s three key ingredients to narrative aircover:  It must be completely within your control. This isn’t about success, it’s just about effort. Not “I’m selling tons of art” but “I’m making an art website platform”.  Preferably non revenue generating. So people can’t measure it’s success (or failure) easily.  It has to be interesting. Art, books, culture, community, non-profit. Make it something that makes you more interesting, open doors and starts conversations.Then, while you’re trying to figure out whether you’re an “independent consultant” or “just unemployed” you can talk to people about what you’re up to: “I’m building an art platform, and looking for consulting work”3. Change is continuous and self-directed, so you should stomach “bad work” because you can escape it fasterIn full time employment change happens slowly in discrete jumps. You get a promotion or a new job. But being indie is a continual process of evolution. A never ending process of becoming.When I started out, I had dreams of doing “innovation work” but quickly landed SEO audit work instead and (mostly) hated myself. Until I realized that cashing in invoices was simply the way to start the engine. Within 9 months I was already leaving that work behind and evolving my offering, the seniority of my clients and more.So do whatever it takes to cash those first few invoices. That work doesn’t define you, you can iterate your identity and confidence with every single client. Fire up the engine and power out of it into better / more interesting / more expensive work. It’ll happen faster than you think.4. How much “time” you have is really about how much energy you haveYour first instinct is to think about capacity - to try and ask “how much work can I do at one time?” but this is the wrong way to think about it for two clear reasons:  Clients come in bursts - so when good work comes along you need to say yes to it and ride the peaks (there are ways to do that without burning out: more in this post The Jigsaw of Independence)  Your headspace is a function of your energy and the kind of work done, not a function of minutes and hours.Time, energy and money are three forces in constant tension. But energy is a stronger force than you think. Now that you’re out on your own you need to build your own mix of projects, only some of which will be revenue generating. Feed your soul with the right balance and you’ll be able to achieve so much more than narrowing your work too tightly. Importantly - don’t judge your projects by “how cool they sound” or “how creative they seem” - focus specifically on what the work looks like day to day. Nourish yourself and cash and calendar freedom will follow.🧭 🗺️ 🧭Ok, so with those assumptions out the way, here’s a map. It’s not THE map, it’s mostly MY map. But it’s A map. And there aren’t enough of those for indie careers so let’s sketch this out together.There’s phases.If I had to guess each phase is 9-18 months? But I bet that varies greatly.Phase 1: Making the leap, zero to oneThis phase typically starts just before you actually quit your job. Starting to think about going independent, trying to line up work for when you quit. This phase is defined by doing whatever it takes to send your first invoice without shattering your self-confidence and identity.Above the surface: Do whatever it takes to get your first invoice paid  Who can you email? Old clients, bosses, colleagues? Send a note letting them know you’re looking for work.  How can you let people know that you’re “in the market”?  How can you assemble a portfolio or set of case studies?Below the surface: Do whatever it takes to hold yourself together  What is something you can do that’s public and within your control as narrative aircover?  Take some time for self-care. Exercise, creativity, emotion. You may well be hurting in your job so go easy on yourself. Remind yourself what you love in life.  Maybe start a practice of journaling or note taking as a way to examine your own identity and ego more directly?Potential failure modes:  Trying to craft a tight positioning for your work. You’ll fail because you don’t have any work yet, don’t know what you want to do or who you want to be. What you’re really chasing is a coherent identity. Chase narrative aircover right now instead.  Trying to do client work AND build a startup or Big Project. Have patience. Remember that freelancing and consulting isn’t a treadmill, it’s a path to cash and calendar freedom. Equity and building comes later. Send an invoice first.  Don’t over-complicate your business setup. I didn’t start an LLC till year 2 and I still make my invoices in Google Docs and track revenue in a spreadsheet. It’s OK to be afraid of this stuff, it’s not OK to be paralyzed by it. It’s new and uncomfortable, but it’s not hard. And it doesn’t have to be complicated.In phase 1 you steer by number of invoices sent. One invoice after the next. Set some simple financial goals and smash them. The work doesn’t define you. You’re just getting the cash flowing as a precursor to everything else.Phase 2: Getting startedThis phase is the real beginnings of freelance/independent living. You’ve got a few clients, done a little work, sent some invoices. Now you start to question whether this client work is any fun. Are you being useful? Doing good work? This phase is defined by deliberate learning and experimentation.Above the surface:  Care about your work product. Share them with friends. Ask clients for feedback. Think about ways to level up and get more senior in your work. What does the level above you look like?  Are there ways to reject “how this work is done” to focus on the bit that you think has the most value?  Experiment with writing and “being visible” - whether blog posts or LinkedIn posts. You need to develop a voice and the only way to do that is through experimenting and hitting publish on things. Any things. Small things. Things with personality.  How did your current clients find you? What commonality can you draw from this in terms of industry / job role / how they found you? How can you use that to find more people like them?  Maybe think about starting a newsletter or a blog. But don’t overthink it. It’s not “The Ultimate Destination for Content Marketing Strategy” - it’s just “Tom’s blog” for now. Remove the pressure and don’t worry about a niche. Just publish. One foot in front of the other.Below the surface:  How are you spending your time? Which parts of client work light you up? What do you want to do more/less of?  Notice which things you say that get the strongest reaction from clients. This is your early signal of where your voice is and where your opinions are interesting to the market.  Find other people on the indie path (hi!) and chat with them. Build relationships, coffee meetings, friendships and communities. Start one if you can’t find one. This is essential psychological and identity work to make this path sustainable.Potential failure modes:  Trying to partner with others. You likely miss having colleagues and team mates. And you’re likely slightly insecure about the quality of your work. THAT’S OK. Me too. You don’t have to deal with that by building a goddam agency or finding partners. Join (or start) a slack group. Find a few peers to chat with and chat with them. Meet people for coffee meetings. Share your work products with close friends and advisors. Starting an agency ruins your ability to use consulting revenue as the cash and calendar freedom you need later on.  Crafting a positioning statement. Seriously. Streaks &gt; niches. Anytime you think you want to craft a tight positioning statement, instead of putting it on your homepage as “I do X for Y” instead write a 2,000 word blogpost about “How I do X for Y”. Don’t be so arrogant to asusme that you have tons of leads and need positioning to filter your leads. Instead it’s about demand generation - how do you get more people knowing about you. And whatever you do don’t write that essay in businessspeak. Let your punk and vibe ooze out of the pores. It’s about showing off how you think, not doing some generic SEO or content marketing bullshit.In phase 2 you steer by finding a way to publish and be visible. Nothing heroic, just developing the consistent habit of writing. Streaks and modes not niches.Phase 3: Find stabilityThis phase is where we start to really find our groove. If you’re doing it well this is where you step on the gas in terms of revenue and figure out how to consistently find good clients.Above the surface:  Raise your seniority and raise your rates. Chase more senior work, more expensive work.  Think deeply about the venn diagram of work you enjoy and work that the market wants. Especially where, as an independent you can deliver value differently from how an agency would approach it. Drive to client value.  Create a consistent publishing habit. Twitter/LinkedIn/Email/Blog doesn’t matter too much but you’re really gonna regret not building this habit at this stage.  Consider starting a community - now that you know a bit about yourself and the kind of work that you’re doing focus on either invest some serious time in another community or build your own. Networks matter.Below the surface:  You can’t sustain publishing without being interested in something. So deeply consider how to write and publish in a way that keeps you engaged. Don’t write “for SEO” or some BS. Figure out what you’re interested in and write about that. Write it in your real voice, not your business voice.  You’re a real business now but that doesn’t mean you have to act like one. Find language to describe your work in a way that doesn’t make you want to vomit. Simple language. Focus on being senior and signaling that you’re expensive.  You probably want an LLC and business apparatus at this point. Find a way to have “your corporate entity” send your invoices. Otherwise you’re going to vomit when you send a $50k invoice (or worse, get anxious and panic and never send the invoice). You need some psychological armor for the arena of capitalism.Potential failure modes:  Don’t try and operationalize your way out of the routine work. Don’t hire people, don’t outsource. Just elevate into the more senior strategy work. Charge more. Building a whole machine to do the execution work is just trapping yourself at this level and prevents you reaching level 4 &amp; 5. Consider partnering with agencies or vendors to work on the execution but remain separate - don’t bring on responsibilities or overhead.  Now that you’re earning good money you can get stuck just doing the same thing over and over again. Force yourself to keep learning, keep moving. There are always more senior levels to reach. Look for them, get access to them.  Now that you’re generating leads for good money it’s easy to simply burnout from overwork. You’re forcing your rates higher and higher and it’s getting harder and harder to say no to work (“Can I turn down this $20k client gig to take a week off”). Don’t overwhelm yourself with hours worked - take breaks. Start an exercise routine (yours has probably evaporated in phases 1 and 2 I’m sorry to say). Remember: price every project so that you’re happy when they say yes.  Not being visible enough. You can be increasing your fees, making good money but if you’re not being visible enough (find a mode, not a niche) then if a big client engagement ends you can enter a big deep dark hole where revenue tanks and you question everything. This can rock your confidence and send you into a tailspin. You have to build your fees and your visibility in lockstep. Dealflow dealflow dealflow.  C’mon. You’re STILL gonna want to craft a tight positioning. Don’t do it. Just write. Streaks &gt; niches. You’ll think you have the confidence to actually nail a positioning statement now - something that’s TRUE. But it’s a trap. You’ll end up getting stuck in this phase and never elevating out into phase 4 &amp; 5. A tightly crafted positioning statement can actually prevent you from securing senior work and reaching the cash/calendar freedom stage.In phase 3 you steer by number of good clients. Can you predictably generate clients doing senior (and expensive) work that you actually find interesting? Note that if you’re retaining them for a long time you don’t necessarily need that many of them. But you need to have some confidence that there’s another one just around the corner.Phase 4: Find freedomHere’s where it starts to get fun. This is where that sparring idea comes in. You’re starting to be able to do expensive work without committing a huge amount of time. This is the idea of tenure that I talked about at the beginning. You’re approaching tenure and want to keep pushing to find client work that is BOTH well paid AND leaves you some headspace.Above the surface:  Hopefully you’ve figured out some kind of distinctive opinion and perspective on your work by now. No! Don’t turn it into positioning - but do turn it into a vibe essay (or 5). Show your thinking, get into the details. You’re chasing senior clients and that requires exposing some vibes.  If you examine your relationship between time/energy/money closely enough you should be able to start saying no to the kind of work you were doing in phase 2 and 3. This will feel scary and painful - don’t be afraid to move your threshold around a bit. Say no, then when cash gets tight start saying yes, then try saying no again a few months later. Iterate!  Leverage your communities and networks to have some honest financial conversations with other senior indies. This will give you the confience to charge 10x what you were charging when you first started - that will feel terrifying so you’ll need some concrete examples, peers and support system to back you up.Below the surface:  Some deep existential questions might be setting in about now. Is this work really more interesting than taking that CMO role? Should I stick the course? Where does this path lead? Don’t worry about the answers to these questions - the most important thing is to keep learning. Keep pushing on things that interest you.  You might get tempted to standardize work or package up your pricing into defined “packages”. Tread carefully here - it can be very easy to sink a lot of time and energy into something that only generates “phase 3” work. Is that what you really want to be spending your time on?  If you’ve built a publishing practice, it might be feeling stale right now. You might think it’s feeling bland or generic. You might question whether it’s really worth doing. This is a sign that your taste is developing. Your taste is growing and you’re looking at your own work with a very senior, experienced lens. This is a good sign to push your writing into weirder, deeper territory. Talk about the way your industry really works, not how everyone else thinks it works. Developing opinion is continuous work that is never done.Potential failure modes:  A lot of the work is getting routine and easy here. You know how to generate clients. So what is there left? It’s easy to get bored and disconnected from the work. Find a way to keep yourself interested in the work itself. Write a book about the practice of the work. Read some academic papers about your field.  Not building up a warchest. If you’re building up cashflow and simply spending it then you’re running a risk. By this time you’ve been self-employed for 5-7 years. The chances are only increasing that you’re going to need to take time off for a medical emergency (you or loved ones). Or take an actual holiday. Or buy a house. So don’t be stupid - cash looks like king but the world runs on credit/savings/retirement/health insurance etc. Start building wealth (mental, physical, economic).In phase 4 you steer by how much of your time is your own. Sure, you’re charging $20k / month but it’s only for 2 days a week. The other days are actually your own (vs the kind of work in phase 2 &amp; 3 where you’re “only working two days a week” but in reality you’re getting pinged all the time all day long). Notice these stretches and start to project them. If you can do that and sustain it you’ve built cash and calendar freedom.Phase 5: Build equityI’d love to tell you how this story ends but I’m at the edge of my own map. I’m about to sail into the unknown. Maybe the earth is flat and I’ll fall off the edge. I have only a hazy understanding of what phase 5 looks like or where it ends. Is there a phase 6? What are the failure modes for phase 5? I’m not completely sure. I’d consider myself somewhere right between phases 4 and 5 today. Here’s some ideas:Above the surface:  Are you presenting yourself to the C-suite and senior stakeholders correctly?  Are there opportunities to take equity in companies you’re working with or advising?  You might have several different personas or brands at this point (like me: tomcritchlow.com and the SEO MBA).Below the surface:  What do you really want to spend your cash/calendar freedom on? Family? A startup? What kind of equity do you need to continue this for the next 15-20 years?  You might get tempted to write a book / launch a conference or some other ego driven identity project. (I’m writing a book!). Remember to embed your real self in it.Potential failure modes:  Given your publishing and point of view you might feel comfortable adding new brands and deliberate products / consulting offerings. I think you have to be careful here. Early success isn’t necessarily the same thing as launching something you can sustain.  If you’re spending a lot of your calendar freedom on something totally unrelated to your consulting work then you will feel disconnected from the work. I’m guessing the right answer is to deliberately dive into a specific area/topic and understand it more deeply than anyone else. What can you be a world class expert in? Be sure to include things you’re actually interested in here.  Can you legitimately say no to phase 4 work? What does phase 5 work look like? Don’t know the answer to this.  If you bite off a big creative / ego project like writing a book, be careful of stalling out. Investing a significant amount of time into something that doesn’t see the light of day can cripple your self confidence.I think you steer in phase 5 by building sustainable wealth. Beyond cashflow, is your total wealth (physical, mental, family, economic) growing over time? Maybe in this phase you need to actually measure those things directly….🧭 🗺️ 🧭As I said up top - this isn’t THE map. It’s probably not even MY OWN - I probably fictionalized and mis-remembered my own experience. But I hope it’s useful. Remember that change is a continuous process - and you have to look after yourself, because there’s no safety net.            Rightly so perhaps if you read the headlines about folks like McKinsey… &#8617;      "

  "date": "June 3, 2022",
  "content": "I’ve got a few friends on the cusp of independent life, either just about to leap into the unknown or already quit and they’re trying to figure it out.So here’s a half-baked thesis and possible blueprint for navigating indie life.🧭 🗺️ 🧭First, some core assumptions and insights:1. Consulting can build cash freedomPeople get an allergic reaction to the label “consulting” 1 but I’d like to argue that trading time for money is a great economic tool. It provides you cash leverage to pursue all kinds of other things.For that reason, and because it’s what I know, consulting and client work features heavily here. You do you. But bear in mind that “client work” / freelancing / consulting comes in many different guises.In particular, as you get more senior there are ways to do consulting work that don’t ruin your headspace. I wrote about that in my piece Sparring &amp; Tenure for Indie Consultants. Not all kinds of work have the same headspace, stress and time commitment.It can be a real failure mode to try and “start a startup” and “do some consulting” at the same time. Trying to balance these two competing types of work is extremely stressful and difficult.Instead, view consulting work (i.e. freelance work) as a way to stabilize cash flow, build a cash war-chest and leverage into higher order forms of consulting that are high $$ while low headspace (like sparring). Getting to a point where you can do client projects with high revenue and clear time boxed availability is the necessary freedom you need to be able to also build a startup / write a book / build a project that might have real equity.Consulting builds no equity, but it builds cash and calendar freedom to be able to build something that has equity without having to take on debt.2. Positioning is for the ego, not for the marketI’ve got a full post in draft about this, but in short - it’s more important to find a way to be visible, with a distinct vibe, rather than craft a tight positioning (“I am an X for Y” or “I do XYZ for companies like ABC”). You think positioning is important but it’s just for your own sense of self-narrative and identity. Which by the way is important!Paul Millerd captured this as don’t find a niche, find a mode and Venkatesh articulated as find a streak not a niche.So, you have to find a mode, or a streak. It’s easier and more valuable than crafting a tight positioning.But - your identity and self-narrative is important! So you should also craft some narrative aircover. This is some kind of project, website, initiative that you can lean on during the early days of figuring out indie life. Before you have a stable, real sense of how you’re making money or even WTF you’re doing you want some narrative aircover. There’s three key ingredients to narrative aircover:  It must be completely within your control. This isn’t about success, it’s just about effort. Not “I’m selling tons of art” but “I’m making an art website platform”.  Preferably non revenue generating. So people can’t measure it’s success (or failure) easily.  It has to be interesting. Art, books, culture, community, non-profit. Make it something that makes you more interesting, open doors and starts conversations.Then, while you’re trying to figure out whether you’re an “independent consultant” or “just unemployed” you can talk to people about what you’re up to: “I’m building an art platform, and looking for consulting work”3. Change is continuous and self-directed, so you should stomach “bad work” because you can escape it fasterIn full time employment change happens slowly in discrete jumps. You get a promotion or a new job. But being indie is a continual process of evolution. A never ending process of becoming.When I started out, I had dreams of doing “innovation work” but quickly landed SEO audit work instead and (mostly) hated myself. Until I realized that cashing in invoices was simply the way to start the engine. Within 9 months I was already leaving that work behind and evolving my offering, the seniority of my clients and more.So do whatever it takes to cash those first few invoices. That work doesn’t define you, you can iterate your identity and confidence with every single client. Fire up the engine and power out of it into better / more interesting / more expensive work. It’ll happen faster than you think.4. How much “time” you have is really about how much energy you haveYour first instinct is to think about capacity - to try and ask “how much work can I do at one time?” but this is the wrong way to think about it for two clear reasons:  Clients come in bursts - so when good work comes along you need to say yes to it and ride the peaks (there are ways to do that without burning out: more in this post The Jigsaw of Independence)  Your headspace is a function of your energy and the kind of work done, not a function of minutes and hours.Time, energy and money are three forces in constant tension. But energy is a stronger force than you think. Now that you’re out on your own you need to build your own mix of projects, only some of which will be revenue generating. Feed your soul with the right balance and you’ll be able to achieve so much more than narrowing your work too tightly. Importantly - don’t judge your projects by “how cool they sound” or “how creative they seem” - focus specifically on what the work looks like day to day. Nourish yourself and cash and calendar freedom will follow.🧭 🗺️ 🧭Ok, so with those assumptions out the way, here’s a map. It’s not THE map, it’s mostly MY map. But it’s A map. And there aren’t enough of those for indie careers so let’s sketch this out together.There’s phases.If I had to guess each phase is 9-18 months? But I bet that varies greatly.Phase 1: Making the leap, zero to oneThis phase typically starts just before you actually quit your job. Starting to think about going independent, trying to line up work for when you quit. This phase is defined by doing whatever it takes to send your first invoice without shattering your self-confidence and identity.Above the surface: Do whatever it takes to get your first invoice paid  Who can you email? Old clients, bosses, colleagues? Send a note letting them know you’re looking for work.  How can you let people know that you’re “in the market”?  How can you assemble a portfolio or set of case studies?Below the surface: Do whatever it takes to hold yourself together  What is something you can do that’s public and within your control as narrative aircover?  Take some time for self-care. Exercise, creativity, emotion. You may well be hurting in your job so go easy on yourself. Remind yourself what you love in life.  Maybe start a practice of journaling or note taking as a way to examine your own identity and ego more directly?Potential failure modes:  Trying to craft a tight positioning for your work. You’ll fail because you don’t have any work yet, don’t know what you want to do or who you want to be. What you’re really chasing is a coherent identity. Chase narrative aircover right now instead.  Trying to do client work AND build a startup or Big Project. Have patience. Remember that freelancing and consulting isn’t a treadmill, it’s a path to cash and calendar freedom. Equity and building comes later. Send an invoice first.  Don’t over-complicate your business setup. I didn’t start an LLC till year 2 and I still make my invoices in Google Docs and track revenue in a spreadsheet. It’s OK to be afraid of this stuff, it’s not OK to be paralyzed by it. It’s new and uncomfortable, but it’s not hard. And it doesn’t have to be complicated.In phase 1 you steer by number of invoices sent. One invoice after the next. Set some simple financial goals and smash them. The work doesn’t define you. You’re just getting the cash flowing as a precursor to everything else.Phase 2: Getting startedThis phase is the real beginnings of freelance/independent living. You’ve got a few clients, done a little work, sent some invoices. Now you start to question whether this client work is any fun. Are you being useful? Doing good work? This phase is defined by deliberate learning and experimentation.Above the surface:  Care about your work product. Share them with friends. Ask clients for feedback. Think about ways to level up and get more senior in your work. What does the level above you look like?  Are there ways to reject “how this work is done” to focus on the bit that you think has the most value?  Experiment with writing and “being visible” - whether blog posts or LinkedIn posts. You need to develop a voice and the only way to do that is through experimenting and hitting publish on things. Any things. Small things. Things with personality.  How did your current clients find you? What commonality can you draw from this in terms of industry / job role / how they found you? How can you use that to find more people like them?  Maybe think about starting a newsletter or a blog. But don’t overthink it. It’s not “The Ultimate Destination for Content Marketing Strategy” - it’s just “Tom’s blog” for now. Remove the pressure and don’t worry about a niche. Just publish. One foot in front of the other.Below the surface:  How are you spending your time? Which parts of client work light you up? What do you want to do more/less of?  Notice which things you say that get the strongest reaction from clients. This is your early signal of where your voice is and where your opinions are interesting to the market.  Find other people on the indie path (hi!) and chat with them. Build relationships, coffee meetings, friendships and communities. Start one if you can’t find one. This is essential psychological and identity work to make this path sustainable.Potential failure modes:  Trying to partner with others. You likely miss having colleagues and team mates. And you’re likely slightly insecure about the quality of your work. THAT’S OK. Me too. You don’t have to deal with that by building a goddam agency or finding partners. Join (or start) a slack group. Find a few peers to chat with and chat with them. Meet people for coffee meetings. Share your work products with close friends and advisors. Starting an agency ruins your ability to use consulting revenue as the cash and calendar freedom you need later on.  Crafting a positioning statement. Seriously. Streaks &gt; niches. Anytime you think you want to craft a tight positioning statement, instead of putting it on your homepage as “I do X for Y” instead write a 2,000 word blogpost about “How I do X for Y”. Don’t be so arrogant to asusme that you have tons of leads and need positioning to filter your leads. Instead it’s about demand generation - how do you get more people knowing about you. And whatever you do don’t write that essay in businessspeak. Let your punk and vibe ooze out of the pores. It’s about showing off how you think, not doing some generic SEO or content marketing bullshit.In phase 2 you steer by finding a way to publish and be visible. Nothing heroic, just developing the consistent habit of writing. Streaks and modes not niches.Phase 3: Find stabilityThis phase is where we start to really find our groove. If you’re doing it well this is where you step on the gas in terms of revenue and figure out how to consistently find good clients.Above the surface:  Raise your seniority and raise your rates. Chase more senior work, more expensive work.  Think deeply about the venn diagram of work you enjoy and work that the market wants. Especially where, as an independent you can deliver value differently from how an agency would approach it. Drive to client value.  Create a consistent publishing habit. Twitter/LinkedIn/Email/Blog doesn’t matter too much but you’re really gonna regret not building this habit at this stage.  Consider starting a community - now that you know a bit about yourself and the kind of work that you’re doing focus on either invest some serious time in another community or build your own. Networks matter.Below the surface:  You can’t sustain publishing without being interested in something. So deeply consider how to write and publish in a way that keeps you engaged. Don’t write “for SEO” or some BS. Figure out what you’re interested in and write about that. Write it in your real voice, not your business voice.  You’re a real business now but that doesn’t mean you have to act like one. Find language to describe your work in a way that doesn’t make you want to vomit. Simple language. Focus on being senior and signaling that you’re expensive.  You probably want an LLC and business apparatus at this point. Find a way to have “your corporate entity” send your invoices. Otherwise you’re going to vomit when you send a $50k invoice (or worse, get anxious and panic and never send the invoice). You need some psychological armor for the arena of capitalism.Potential failure modes:  Don’t try and operationalize your way out of the routine work. Don’t hire people, don’t outsource. Just elevate into the more senior strategy work. Charge more. Building a whole machine to do the execution work is just trapping yourself at this level and prevents you reaching level 4 &amp; 5. Consider partnering with agencies or vendors to work on the execution but remain separate - don’t bring on responsibilities or overhead.  Now that you’re earning good money you can get stuck just doing the same thing over and over again. Force yourself to keep learning, keep moving. There are always more senior levels to reach. Look for them, get access to them.  Now that you’re generating leads for good money it’s easy to simply burnout from overwork. You’re forcing your rates higher and higher and it’s getting harder and harder to say no to work (“Can I turn down this $20k client gig to take a week off”). Don’t overwhelm yourself with hours worked - take breaks. Start an exercise routine (yours has probably evaporated in phases 1 and 2 I’m sorry to say). Remember: price every project so that you’re happy when they say yes.  Not being visible enough. You can be increasing your fees, making good money but if you’re not being visible enough (find a mode, not a niche) then if a big client engagement ends you can enter a big deep dark hole where revenue tanks and you question everything. This can rock your confidence and send you into a tailspin. You have to build your fees and your visibility in lockstep. Dealflow dealflow dealflow.  C’mon. You’re STILL gonna want to craft a tight positioning. Don’t do it. Just write. Streaks &gt; niches. You’ll think you have the confidence to actually nail a positioning statement now - something that’s TRUE. But it’s a trap. You’ll end up getting stuck in this phase and never elevating out into phase 4 &amp; 5. A tightly crafted positioning statement can actually prevent you from securing senior work and reaching the cash/calendar freedom stage.In phase 3 you steer by number of good clients. Can you predictably generate clients doing senior (and expensive) work that you actually find interesting? Note that if you’re retaining them for a long time you don’t necessarily need that many of them. But you need to have some confidence that there’s another one just around the corner.Phase 4: Find freedomHere’s where it starts to get fun. This is where that sparring idea comes in.

This will feel scary and painful - don’t be afraid to move your threshold around a bit. Say no, then when cash gets tight start saying yes, then try saying no again a few months later. Iterate!  Leverage your communities and networks to have some honest financial conversations with other senior indies. This will give you the confience to charge 10x what you were charging when you first started - that will feel terrifying so you’ll need some concrete examples, peers and support system to back you up.Below the surface:  Some deep existential questions might be setting in about now.

You can watch someone blogging and think that all they’re doing is throwing words into the feed, when in reality they’re sparking many interesting conversations and connections below the surface.The unit of measurement for blogging is the conversation.⛰️🌿⛰️Anyway, here’s a neat story about an underground garden:Baldassare Forestiere was born in 1879, in a hamlet in Sicily. As a young man, he fled his country and domineering father, a fruit grower, for the U.S. Arriving on the East Coast, he learned about underground construction while toiling on the Croton Aqueduct and the Holland Tunnel. In 1904, eager to farm his own land, he purchased a 70-acre plot in Fresno, with the goal of growing citrus on it.Then he dug into the ground and—disaster—he struck hardpan, the rock-like soil that is impermeable to water and impossible to cultivate. He might have surrendered, but he didn’t. Instead, he began carving a home for himself out of that rocky soil structure, using the displaced rocks as building material to reinforce arched doorways and other architectural details. He also discovered, when he dug underneath the hardpan, rich soil in which he could plant citrus trees, grapevines, and other plants—more than 10 feet below the surface. Planted underground, these plants grew more slowly, but also better—so much so that today many of his original trees are still producing fruit.@thepublicsquare https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2019/09/24/the-lessons-of-fresnos-ingenious-underground-gardens/ideas/connecting-california/Building a home and garden up to 25 feet below the surface allowed him to escape the scorching heat of California:Forestiere was ahead of his time in designing a sustainable home. He created skylights and tunnels to bring both breezes and sunlight into the space. He positioned his underground planters to catch rainwater, and he built a drainage system with a cistern to minimize flooding. He grew his own food—not just fruit, but also herbs. He had a pool (with a bridge) and an aquarium stocked with fish taken from the San Joaquin River. He even achieved a cool escape from the brutal Fresno summers. On my recent midday visit, the temperature was 99 degrees in Fresno, but it was just 80 underground.@thepublicsquare https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2019/09/24/the-lessons-of-fresnos-ingenious-underground-gardens/ideas/connecting-california/⛰️🌿⛰️I dunno, maybe an underground garden (blog) isn’t such a bad idea. Maybe, in the scorching heat of social media we need a cooler, darker space for connections and discussion. Where things grow more slowly but still bear fruit 25 years later."

But it’s all sub-surface.Yes, some of the conversation happens in semi-public spaces - places like Twitter or Hacker News. And there are tools that might help you uncover discussion and comments across the web, tools like:  Ampie is an app that gives you a sidebar to surface discussions as you browse the web  Twemex gives you a sidebar on Twitter that encourages more search, makes it easier to see people’s greatest hits and can help you quickly see who’s sharing an article (that’s partly how I use it)  Hypothesis is an annotations platform, and if you install the Chrome extension you can see conversations and discussions on articles as you browse (especially for a certain kind of content)But none of these will let you see the conversations that happen in my Twitter DMs, in various Discord groups or in my Gmail.We think of blogging as being performative but the value is subterranean. You can watch someone blogging and think that all they’re doing is throwing words into the feed, when in reality they’re sparking many interesting conversations and connections below the surface.The unit of measurement for blogging is the conversation.⛰️🌿⛰️Anyway, here’s a neat story about an underground garden:Baldassare Forestiere was born in 1879, in a hamlet in Sicily. As a young man, he fled his country and domineering father, a fruit grower, for the U.S. Arriving on the East Coast, he learned about underground construction while toiling on the Croton Aqueduct and the Holland Tunnel. In 1904, eager to farm his own land, he purchased a 70-acre plot in Fresno, with the goal of growing citrus on it.Then he dug into the ground and—disaster—he struck hardpan, the rock-like soil that is impermeable to water and impossible to cultivate. He might have surrendered, but he didn’t. Instead, he began carving a home for himself out of that rocky soil structure, using the displaced rocks as building material to reinforce arched doorways and other architectural details. He also discovered, when he dug underneath the hardpan, rich soil in which he could plant citrus trees, grapevines, and other plants—more than 10 feet below the surface. Planted underground, these plants grew more slowly, but also better—so much so that today many of his original trees are still producing fruit.@thepublicsquare https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2019/09/24/the-lessons-of-fresnos-ingenious-underground-gardens/ideas/connecting-california/Building a home and garden up to 25 feet below the surface allowed him to escape the scorching heat of California:Forestiere was ahead of his time in designing a sustainable home. He created skylights and tunnels to bring both breezes and sunlight into the space. He positioned his underground planters to catch rainwater, and he built a drainage system with a cistern to minimize flooding. He grew his own food—not just fruit, but also herbs. He had a pool (with a bridge) and an aquarium stocked with fish taken from the San Joaquin River. He even achieved a cool escape from the brutal Fresno summers. On my recent midday visit, the temperature was 99 degrees in Fresno, but it was just 80 underground.@thepublicsquare https://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2019/09/24/the-lessons-of-fresnos-ingenious-underground-gardens/ideas/connecting-california/⛰️🌿⛰️I dunno, maybe an underground garden (blog) isn’t such a bad idea. Maybe, in the scorching heat of social media we need a cooler, darker space for connections and discussion. Where things grow more slowly but still bear fruit 25 years later."

  "title": "Reflecting on things I failed to get done at Google",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/05/12/google-ideas/",
  "date": "May 12, 2022",
  "content": "I’m kind of obsessed with how to get buy-in for your ideas.  Exhibit A: My book on independent consulting  Exhibit B: My SEO MBA online course in executive communicationI worked at Google between 2012-2014, first at the Google Creative Lab and then as part of an internal innovation team that would eventually build Google Jamboard. I thought it would be fun to dust off some of my old ideas and figure out why they never went anywhere.This is one part nostalgia, and one part recording the ideas on my blog for history1. Maybe we can learn something about how to pitch ideas, how to get buy-in and examine corporate frustration and autonomy (or lack thereof).Note that I worked on a bunch of other stuff while I was at Google2 but these were ideas that were mine and I tried to get them off the ground.Idea 1 - Google Workspace“Collaborate on projects, not just docs”The idea: A workspace for Google teams, combining Google+ streams, Gmail and Drive into one unified experience. Somewhere between Basecamp and Slack. This was just before Slack launched (Slack launched in 2013) and frankly I think it was a bit ahead of it’s time.This was (and is) obviously a good idea - for teams “all in” on Google Docs / Drive / Gmail / Hangouts it’s always been frustrating keeping things organized and collaborating on projects3.Google has since launched Google WorkSpaces - they achieve some of the same goals but aren’t anywhere near as fluid as Slack for team chat and collaboration.There were some nice touches I remember. For example: every project would have it’s own email alias - which would be a full gmail account that any member can send/receive from. Creating a kind of transparent-by-default email address. Not only useful for transparency within the team, but also useful for collaborating with external teams &amp; partners. I guess this is like an over-engineered version of shared slack channels? ha!How I pitched it: After mentioning it to Andy Berndt (the SVP running the Creative Lab) he got very excited about it and told me to work on this instead of everything else, but I wasn’t allowed to tell anyone. “This is the most important project in the lab, Tom” I remember him saying.Honestly I’m still not sure what to do with that information.I worked in secret for a few weeks assembling some rough mockups and creating a narrative pitch deck, and then I don’t think I ever got a meeting with Andy again before I got kicked out of the lab. Ha.Why it failed: Well, aside from the loooooong history of Google fumbling the ball with real-time chat products…. I think there’s two reasons it failed. Firstly, I was pitching it inside the Google Creative Lab and the lab hated working on anything that wasn’t consumer facing (remember this was before Slack launched - and Slack kind of pioneered the consumerization of B2B software).Secondly, I wish I’d had a basic prototype, even a basic clickable demo I think could have been powerful. Showing a little space where you can have chat, docs and shared calendar/gmail in one place… I pitched it by mocking up the UI instead of mocking up the work-flow. I think showing a sample project in-flow would have been more powerful than presenting static mocks of UI (and back then my design skills were much worse than they are now).If you look at what Google Workspaces is today - it’s actually a fairly faithful execution of what I had envisaged. But it’s clunky and doesn’t put chat channels as primary. In hindsight, if I’d pitched this with a stronger focus on mobile, real-time chat and lightweight ephemeral channels vs big heavy projects I think it could have gained a bit more steam.Idea 2 - Google Maps Search 2.0“Use maps to search, not just navigate”The idea: I remember one night at 9pm asking myself “where can I get a HDMI cable right now”. Searching Google didn’t give me the answer. Searching Google Maps told me I had to walk a mile to best buy. But the next day I noticed that Rite Aid 100 yards from my apartment sold them. Huh. This was the kernel of an idea - that Google Maps could be a far more powerful search engine, especially for non-navigational queries - driving consumer adoption of commercial queries in Google Maps would in turn unlock a huge revenue potential in Google Maps ads (something that’s still anemic in Google today).The idea I mocked up was basically a reverse web-index, indexing not just the local businesses but indexing their websites too and letting you do keyword search across it. So e.g. if you search for “lamb tagine” Google Maps should find that item on the restaurant menu (they do that a little bit today, but didn’t do this at all in 2012).This is still not a solved problem today. For example, I search for Ethan Lipton on Google Maps and get a single result for Joe’s Pub where Ethan Lipton has played, despite the fact that he is about to play a gig at Barbes soon, near where I live.Now, you could argue that people don’t search Google Maps that way - that people use Google maps to search place names and categories (e.g. “museum of natural history” or “best brunch restaurant”). But I’d argue that of course people search this way - people just expect Google to work. AND - my argument is that IF you launch a new “Google Maps 2.0” campaign you’d get a ton more people using Google Maps in this way - driving up the commercial search volume inventory significantly.How I pitched it: I pitched it by building an actual MVP. I’m still surprised I pulled this off, but I built a working prototype in Google Sheets (ha) that combined the Google Maps API and a web-crawler to mash up local results with an index of what was indexed on their websites to provide an MVP for certain categories of search (e.g. I managed this for restaurant menu items and some ecommerce categories).It actually worked pretty well which I was amazed by and the underlying technology was simple - just combining the Google Maps places info with the Google Search crawl info of what was available.Why it failed: The MVP worked remarkably well, but I wish I’d built a pretty front end on the prototype… Especially trying to get this idea through the stakeholders within the Creative Lab - every time I showed my spreadsheet prototype everyone laughed at me. The lab was so used to world class design that they simply didn’t know what to do with a spreadsheet prototype.Today - I have the skills to build a front end design on top of the data but back then I didn’t have the skills…In hindsight I think I’d have pitched it with three clear, distinct arguments:  A functional demo of the prototype, with a nicely designed front end. Probably recorded as a series of 60 second videos.  A business case - looking at the size of the Google Maps Ads revenue and the volume of commercial queries and estimating some potential revenue opportunity. The Creative Lab would have hated this kind of analysis but I think you could make a clear business case for the idea  A launch campaign. Part of the magic here is that it’s as much about the new technology as it is about an excuse to re-introduce Google Maps search to consumers (and re-introduce Google Maps Ads to businesses). If you’d unveiled a “new kind of maps search” I think it would have done very well.Apple Maps would launch later that year (and completely bomb) - maybe Google Maps wasn’t seen as a big area of strategic priority…Idea 3 - Google Designer“A Google design tool with real time collaboration in your browser”The idea: When I was working on my pitch for Google Workspaces, I built my design and mockups on my own in secret. And I built them in Google Slides. Remember this is years before Figma launched - I didn’t know how to use Adobe illustrator or the like, but I loved how you could resize a Google Slides canvas and do all kinds of basic design right there in your browser. I wrote this post back in 2015 about using Google Slides as a basic design tool.Sure, using Google Slides as a design tool is a TERRIBLE idea, but on the other hand it’s lightning quick, in the browser, free and, importantly, real-time collaborative!My pitch was basically launch a basic design tool as part of the Google Docs suite:  Microsoft Word : Docs  Microsoft Excel: Sheets  Microsoft Powerpoint: Slides  Adobe illustrator: DesignerHow I pitched it: This was the first big idea I had outside of the Creative Lab. I felt like I had more time to pitch the idea around but also less authority and access to senior leadership… So I pitched this one the only way I know how - I built a blog visible inside Google (hosted on an internal appengine instance) and wrote up my pitch. It was pretty similar to that blog post I linked above - showing how I use it, why opening up access to design is important etc.Why it failed: This idea actually had some support - a few senior folks inside the Google Docs team felt like it would be a good idea and gave me a little encouragement but it never turned into anything more. I don’t think it was seen as strategically important vs upgrades to the core docs suite…Ultimately I wonder if I should have pitched this more like Canva than Figma. While personally I’d love to see a full featured Figma competitor from Google, maybe the better analogy is Canva - more like cloud hosted lightweight asset creation than full design product.Some things I might have done differently with hindsight:  Focused on how big the opportunity is. I focused on how cool it would be but perhaps a bit more commercial analysis of Adobe could have given me some bigger numbers to throw around.  I wish I’d thought of the analogy of “We want to do for design in the browser what Gmail did for email in the browser”. I think that wraps up so much of the idea in a way Googlers would have been excited about.  When I spoke with PMs on the Slides team they were mostly very unimpressed - not only did I have zero design background personally but also they felt like slides wasn’t a vector based design tool so would need to be rebuilt from the ground up. Maybe starting with some senior designers inside Google would have been better than trying to win over PMs…Still, even today I think if Google launched a serious real-time collaborative design tool in the browser it would be pretty cool. And it would seriously change the brand image of the Google Docs / Drive suite with something cool to talk about.Idea 4 - Google Cube“A physical assistant that can project light and scan docs”The idea: Ok, this one might not have been very practical but weirdly was perhaps my most promising idea. Basically it was a little device (we sketched it as a little black cube) that could sit on your kitchen table - it had voice commands and it had a tiny short throw projector so that it could project light onto the surface around it. Combined with vision recognition this allowed the device to project a basic UI onto a surface and let you speak and tap to interact with it.This was heavily inspired by the work Berg had just done for Google on smart lamps. In some sense adding the voice &amp; document scanning was just a practical application that allowed all of the cool Berg work to come to life.Honestly in hindsight I’m not quite sure how I missed the idea of a speaker. I’m an idiot I guess - when Alexa launched a few months later I was like “oooooh right of course you just want to talk to it, and play music, that’s 95% of the value”. Still, I still like the idea of projecting light onto a surface. Some things this device could do beyond respond to audio controls:  Scan documents (projecting light to the corners of the document so you know it’s capturing correctly)  Project UI controls onto a surface so you don’t need to talk to it all the time  Project things like recipes onto a countertop - essentially giving you a big, low res screenHow I pitched it: Umm, some sketches!? Honestly this idea has grown on me over time but at the time I thought it was just too far fetched to imagine that I could pitch a hardware product to Google and have them fund it… I made some concept sketches, did some explorations with short throw projectors and got a few people excited.The core utility of projecting light / visual recognition - especially for scanning documents - got people excited, especially within the Docs team.Why it failed: Again, in hindsight I missed the idea of a full voice assistant by a whisker. I think if I’d actually pushed for it I could have gotten some budget and a small team to build a prototype. At the time though the team I was working with was so focused on the Jamboard that it felt like a distraction. Maybe my biggest regret is not exploring a patent for the idea. Might have been something there and that would have been a nice status symbol…⏱️⏱️⏱️Anyway. I’m still wistful for what could have been. I think all these ideas had some kind of viable kernel. It’s easy to look back with the virtue of hindsight, but it’s interesting to me to note the timing:  Google Workspace, pitched in 2012, Slack launched in 2013  Maps Search, pitched early 2012, Apple Maps launched and flopped in Sep 2012  Google Designer, pitched in 2014, Figma launched in 2016  Google Cube, pitched early 2014, Alexa launched Nov 2014I’m not really sure what to make of all that. Maybe my timing was just terrible? Or maybe my timing was amazing. Either way I certainly could have pitched some of these more strongly - it’s a good reminder to actually put some conviction behind your ideas. At the time getting resistance felt like it shut the whole idea down but now, looking back I can see how I could have easily built out much more robust pitches and business cases for each of these.Anyway, thanks for coming to my therapy session.            Hopefully enough time has passed that no Gogole lawyers come after me… &#8617;              It’s worth noting that while it wasn’t my job explicitly to come up with new ideas, it wasn’t NOT my job either. In both roles there was a culture that encouraged “anyone to have ideas” - and I saw first hand lots of projects that started as a simple idea from a colleague or peer. &#8617;              It’s remarkable how Google is spectacularly good at collaboration on documents and spectacularly bad at collaboration on projects. &#8617;      "

If you’d unveiled a “new kind of maps search” I think it would have done very well.Apple Maps would launch later that year (and completely bomb) - maybe Google Maps wasn’t seen as a big area of strategic priority…Idea 3 - Google Designer“A Google design tool with real time collaboration in your browser”The idea: When I was working on my pitch for Google Workspaces, I built my design and mockups on my own in secret. And I built them in Google Slides. Remember this is years before Figma launched - I didn’t know how to use Adobe illustrator or the like, but I loved how you could resize a Google Slides canvas and do all kinds of basic design right there in your browser. I wrote this post back in 2015 about using Google Slides as a basic design tool.Sure, using Google Slides as a design tool is a TERRIBLE idea, but on the other hand it’s lightning quick, in the browser, free and, importantly, real-time collaborative!My pitch was basically launch a basic design tool as part of the Google Docs suite:  Microsoft Word : Docs  Microsoft Excel: Sheets  Microsoft Powerpoint: Slides  Adobe illustrator: DesignerHow I pitched it: This was the first big idea I had outside of the Creative Lab. I felt like I had more time to pitch the idea around but also less authority and access to senior leadership… So I pitched this one the only way I know how - I built a blog visible inside Google (hosted on an internal appengine instance) and wrote up my pitch. It was pretty similar to that blog post I linked above - showing how I use it, why opening up access to design is important etc.Why it failed: This idea actually had some support - a few senior folks inside the Google Docs team felt like it would be a good idea and gave me a little encouragement but it never turned into anything more. I don’t think it was seen as strategically important vs upgrades to the core docs suite…Ultimately I wonder if I should have pitched this more like Canva than Figma. While personally I’d love to see a full featured Figma competitor from Google, maybe the better analogy is Canva - more like cloud hosted lightweight asset creation than full design product.Some things I might have done differently with hindsight:  Focused on how big the opportunity is. I focused on how cool it would be but perhaps a bit more commercial analysis of Adobe could have given me some bigger numbers to throw around.  I wish I’d thought of the analogy of “We want to do for design in the browser what Gmail did for email in the browser”. I think that wraps up so much of the idea in a way Googlers would have been excited about.  When I spoke with PMs on the Slides team they were mostly very unimpressed - not only did I have zero design background personally but also they felt like slides wasn’t a vector based design tool so would need to be rebuilt from the ground up. Maybe starting with some senior designers inside Google would have been better than trying to win over PMs…Still, even today I think if Google launched a serious real-time collaborative design tool in the browser it would be pretty cool. And it would seriously change the brand image of the Google Docs / Drive suite with something cool to talk about.Idea 4 - Google Cube“A physical assistant that can project light and scan docs”The idea: Ok, this one might not have been very practical but weirdly was perhaps my most promising idea. Basically it was a little device (we sketched it as a little black cube) that could sit on your kitchen table - it had voice commands and it had a tiny short throw projector so that it could project light onto the surface around it. Combined with vision recognition this allowed the device to project a basic UI onto a surface and let you speak and tap to interact with it.This was heavily inspired by the work Berg had just done for Google on smart lamps. In some sense adding the voice &amp; document scanning was just a practical application that allowed all of the cool Berg work to come to life.Honestly in hindsight I’m not quite sure how I missed the idea of a speaker. I’m an idiot I guess - when Alexa launched a few months later I was like “oooooh right of course you just want to talk to it, and play music, that’s 95% of the value”. Still, I still like the idea of projecting light onto a surface. Some things this device could do beyond respond to audio controls:  Scan documents (projecting light to the corners of the document so you know it’s capturing correctly)  Project UI controls onto a surface so you don’t need to talk to it all the time  Project things like recipes onto a countertop - essentially giving you a big, low res screenHow I pitched it: Umm, some sketches!? Honestly this idea has grown on me over time but at the time I thought it was just too far fetched to imagine that I could pitch a hardware product to Google and have them fund it… I made some concept sketches, did some explorations with short throw projectors and got a few people excited.The core utility of projecting light / visual recognition - especially for scanning documents - got people excited, especially within the Docs team.Why it failed: Again, in hindsight I missed the idea of a full voice assistant by a whisker. I think if I’d actually pushed for it I could have gotten some budget and a small team to build a prototype. At the time though the team I was working with was so focused on the Jamboard that it felt like a distraction. Maybe my biggest regret is not exploring a patent for the idea. Might have been something there and that would have been a nice status symbol…⏱️⏱️⏱️Anyway. I’m still wistful for what could have been. I think all these ideas had some kind of viable kernel. It’s easy to look back with the virtue of hindsight, but it’s interesting to me to note the timing:  Google Workspace, pitched in 2012, Slack launched in 2013  Maps Search, pitched early 2012, Apple Maps launched and flopped in Sep 2012  Google Designer, pitched in 2014, Figma launched in 2016  Google Cube, pitched early 2014, Alexa launched Nov 2014I’m not really sure what to make of all that. Maybe my timing was just terrible? Or maybe my timing was amazing. Either way I certainly could have pitched some of these more strongly - it’s a good reminder to actually put some conviction behind your ideas. At the time getting resistance felt like it shut the whole idea down but now, looking back I can see how I could have easily built out much more robust pitches and business cases for each of these.Anyway, thanks for coming to my therapy session.            Hopefully enough time has passed that no Gogole lawyers come after me… &#8617;              It’s worth noting that while it wasn’t my job explicitly to come up with new ideas, it wasn’t NOT my job either. In both roles there was a culture that encouraged “anyone to have ideas” - and I saw first hand lots of projects that started as a simple idea from a colleague or peer. &#8617;              It’s remarkable how Google is spectacularly good at collaboration on documents and spectacularly bad at collaboration on projects. &#8617;      "

  "content": "Why are executive dashboards so bad?In my consulting work, almost every company has lackluster reporting and dashboards. These days it’s less a case of completely missing reporting (though that still happens) but rather the things the executive team are looking at regularly lack any real insight into the business.Most of my consulting work revolves around putting together some kind of strategic plan. It usually boils down to a kind of basic equation, something like:“If you invest $$ into activities X, Y and Z then over 2 years we can achieve $$$”You secure buy-in from the key players, grab the money and get to work.Oddly though - companies only tend to measure the right hand of the equation.Company dashboards are designed around metrics and measurement of results - they’re trying to measure what has happened.Measuring what happened is important, obviously. But it’s a bit like driving a car only looking in the rear view mirror…It’s also important, however, to measure what is happening.Unfortunately in my consulting work most companies don’t have any kind of measurement in place for the left hand side of the equation.📈📈📈Maybe there’s a blind spot in my consulting. When you put a plan together that says “If you invest $$ into activities X, Y and Z then over 2 years we can achieve $$$” - then there’s some kind of assumption, either explicit or implicit that activities X, Y and Z will produce results.It’s kind of obvious that you have to find evidence for this historically - I like to show how investing in these activities has paid off previously, or how a similar situation worked out for a similar business.But perhaps I could better articulate how this future investment will play out. Not just a business model showing X, Y and Z with revenue potential, but actually showing how you would measure progress on each initiative. It always feels implied to me that when you invest in a plan you need to measure progress, but I think I could be more proactive in bundling the measurement plan with the pitch… Hmm.📈📈📈The book Working Backwards explores this idea - Amazon calls them “input metrics” or “controllable input metrics”. From the book:The simple answer is that we are not taught to think like this. When people say “be more data driven”, we immediately assume, “oh, we have to measure our business outcomes”. And so we measure things like number of deals closed, or cohort retention rates, or revenue growth, or number of blog visitors. These are all output metrics — and while they are important, they are also not particularly actionable.Amazon argues that it’s not enough to know your output metrics. In fact, they go even further, and say that you shouldn’t pay much attention to your output metrics; you should pay attention to the controllable input metrics that you know will affect those output metrics. It is a very different thing when, say, your customer support team knows that their performance bonuses are tied to a combination of NPS and ‘% of support tickets closed within 3 days’. If you have clearly demonstrated a link between the former and the latter, then everyone on that team would be incentivised to come up with process improvements to bring that % up!@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/working-backwards/Input metrics are like measuring the left hand side of the equation! You’re measuring the things that supposedly impact the revenue. Today’s measure of revenue is not a good measure of tomorrow’s revenue - input metrics are better.Interestingly - it’s quite hard to find the right input metrics, it’s not always obvious exactly which input metrics actually influence future revenue.When we realized that the teams had chosen the wrong input metric—which was revealed via the WBR process—we changed the metric to reflect consumer demand instead. Over multiple WBR meetings, we asked ourselves, “If we work to change this selection metric, as currently defined, will it result in the desired output?” As we gathered more data and observed the business, this particular selection metric evolved over time from- number of detail pages, which we refined to- number of detail page views (you don't get credit for a new detail page if customers don't view it), which then became- the percentage of detail page views where the products were in stock (you don't get credit if you add items but can't keep them in stock), which was ultimately finalized as- the percentage of detail page views where the products were in stock and immediately ready for two-day shipping, which ended up being called 'Fast Track In Stock'.@holistics_bi https://www.holistics.io/blog/how-amazon-measures/I think the basic working model for people is that metrics measure the business, when in fact input metrics help you learn about the business. By iterating and refining your input metrics you actually become a stronger operator - you learn more specifically which levers actually get results. Dive into the full post from Cedric Chin here for a bit more.📈📈📈But, there’s something deeper here. Over the last few years I basically only work with the C-suite of organizations. Supposedly the “people in charge”. But time and time again my point of contact is frustrated at the state of reporting internally, while also not doing anything about it. So why not fix it?Output metrics feel neutral. They’re observations about what happened - so it’s hard to argue with them.Input metrics, on the other hand, are more opinionated - as we just saw they’re not perfect measures or predictors of future revenue and in fact you might iterate and refine them over time. You might disagree with them!This brings a power dynamic into play that I find interesting. Senior executives - CEOs or founders even - who feel unable (or unwilling) to impose new dashboards and metrics on the business. Everyone is scared of micro-managing. Perhaps also senior executives don’t feel confident understanding the mechanics of the actual work well enough to oversee the creation of input metrics?📈📈📈Dashboards are a battleground for power in other ways too.I often see teams frustrated that the way they’re measured doesn’t accurately reflect the effort / nuance / expertise / care that they feel is necessary for their work to succeed.But I rarely see teams advocating to change the measure!This is the metrics mindset that only measures concrete outputs. But you have the freedom to make your own measures. I recall working with a content publishing business (think someone like Wirecutter) where we were trying to nail down some measure of “quality content”. Not a simple problem - and certainly one that’s hard to find an objective metric for. But eventually we got a few senior people around the table, created a simple 5 point scale on a few key areas, and then asked everyone to rate content subjectively on that 5 point scale.If I remember correctly it was questions like:  “Is the summary of the page clear within 30 seconds?”  “Can you immediately tell that it’s written by experts?”  “Have we demonstrated that we did hands-on testing of the products?”Everyone scores the content, you average the scores and create a blended “quality score” for content. This in turn creates a metric that you can use to measure some of the intangible “content quality” ideas that the team felt was important, but wasn’t reflected in the existing dashboards.Once we got this quality score added to the dashboards it wasn’t long before the CEO was demanding that we increase the average content quality of our pages.You manage what you measure. So think carefully about how to measure what you want to be managed by.📈📈📈I’m very interested in what Doubleloop is building. They’re basically a kind of strategy canvas where you can plug various input metrics into output metrics and measure them with live data. Here’s a quick overview:I like this idea - that we should be questioning and exploring the dependencies of our strategic plan directly! We make a bunch of assumptions in the initial strategy pitch and then…. never go back and check whether we were right? Seems kind of nuts.📈📈📈I’m also interested in what Variance is building. Starting with the opinionated thesis that Product-Led Growth should enable prospects to engage, sign-up, set up billing and then actually use the product - Variance is building a reporting product that allows you to see prospects on an account by account basis as they move through various “milestones” of user action:I’m interested in this because I think it’s smart and useful - but also because it’s building software around an embedded thesis or ideology. IF product-led growth, THEN here’s the CRM product for you… I think we’ll see more of this kind of opinionated software in B2B emerging.📈📈📈My brother is raving about the book Four Disciplines of Execution (summary). The book has a similar notion to Amazon’s around leading indicator vs lagging indicators. But they also have this idea of scoreboards.Discipline Three: Keep a Compelling ScoreboardTo remain engaged, the team should know at all times if they are winning. People play more seriously when they are keeping score. Without knowing the score, staff will be distracted by the whirlwind. A visible scoreboard helps the team to work out how to move forward.There is a big difference between a manager’s scoreboard and a team’s scoreboard. The team’s scoreboard should be simple, visible, show both lead and lag measures (actions and results), and show at-a-glance if the team is winning. It can be motivating for the team to physically create their own board.Julius Reizen https://medium.com/swlh/the-four-disciplines-of-execution-295d6c2ec102Mmm. I like this notion of “Player scoreboards” vs “Coach Scoreboards”. It reminds me that every single dashboard is, implicitly, an exercise in incentive design. By choosing what goes into the dashboard you’re emphasizing what’s important, and what’s not.The medium is the message, you manage what you measure etc etc.📈📈📈Talking of the “medium of dashboards” - I’ve been spending a lot of time in Google Data Studio recently and I really appreciate the idea of a blank canvas to design layout and reporting on top of. It implicitly encourages layout as a primary activity.Yes, it’s technically possible to do all kinds of fancy design in a spreadsheet too - but any design or styling work you do is more fragile in a spreadsheet and, mostly, people don’t bother.I mean - like any design tool I see plenty of Google Data Studio reports that make my eyes bleed! But on balance I like the notion of starting with a blank canvas. A data studio report feels very different to a spreadsheet report. It forces me to more clearly make tradeoffs between visual hierarchy, position and relation.📈📈📈Another nice thing about Google Data Studio - it allows you to separate access to the dashboard from access to the underlying data source. So you can safely circulate a data studio report to various stakeholders. This can be handy since a dashboard is only as powerful as it’s a shared object.The more teams use dashboards and rely on them the more they become cemented as powerful.I’ve written before about the age of permeable organizations: the idea that organizations increasingly have a series of orbital stakeholders with a blurring of the boundaries between “inside” and “outside” the organization.Maybe DAOs are relevant here?If quarterly reports are the traditional way of exposing data outside the organization - a realtime dashboard is the web3 way of doing it? DAOs are (optimistically) the modern business structure designed for orbital stakeholders.And maybe (maybe!) a DAO that tokenizes input will naturally have a leg up - their dashboard by default will show input metrics and output metrics…📈📈📈But maybe dashboards don’t even need metrics or numbers on them at all! As we move towards an oral and visual culture with video, memes and social media, maybe dashboards need more rich context? Again, from Amazon:Amazon employs many techniques to ensure that anecdotes reach the teams that own and operate a service. One example is a program called the Voice of the Customer. The customer service department routinely collects and summarizes customer feedback and presents it during the WBR, though not necessarily every week. The chosen feedback does not always reflect the most commonly received complaint, and the CS department has wide latitude on what to present. When the stories are read at the WBR, they are often painful to hear because they highlight just how much we let customers down. But they always provide a learning experience and an opportunity for us to improve.@holistics_bi https://www.holistics.io/blog/how-amazon-measures/This tracks nicely to what I see inside organizations. Too often user research is a one-time activity, and often buried deep inside the product or marketing org. It’s not a strategic activity. What would it look like to structure user research at a strategic, executive dashboard level? Maybe something like Amazon’s voice of the customer.📈📈📈So, I know that every client I work with needs help setting up better dashboards. But I also know that a dashboard is a powerful object. Changing it requires bravery and nuance. To recap these ideas - here’s some ways to interrogate your own reporting setup to see how you might change:1. Qualitative vs QuantitativeIs your dashboard raw data or is there some post-processing? Are you using expertise to create gradings or analysis on top of the data? Is there a voice of the customer segment for your reporting?2. Input vs OutputAre you reporting only on what has already happened or are you showing what’s happening now? Obviously you need both, but in my experience companies rely too heavily on output metrics.3. Flexible vs FixedHow often do you update the metrics you’re reporting on? Are you explicitly designing your metrics to be updated? What’s your feedback loop for checking that inputs actually lead to the right outputs?4. Open vs ClosedWho gets to see the dashboard? How do you ensure that everyone is on the same page? Are you capturing the potential value in a world of orbital stakeholders from opening up the dashboard to a wider set of people?📈📈📈Maybe dashboards and strategic plans need to be more closely entwined?–Update #1: Some good links posted on twitter:  Daniel Schmidt, CEO of Doubleloop wrote about “Flat metrics dashboards”  Consultant Andrew Bartholomew wrote Good Dashboard, Bad Dashboard–Update #2: Some great links here, Clare’s talk is great:It’s an emotional need rather than a functional one. I call it the executive safety blanket. https://t.co/rwoRZcjsrgClare Gollnick’s talk about dashboards points to why:https://t.co/YTUDED0Ibn&mdash; Chris Butler (@chrizbot) May 6, 2022–Update #3: I recorded a podcast episode with my friend Nigel talking all about exec level dashboards:–Update #4: Love this post from the head of data at Reforge, looking at the data(!) around which executives look at which dashboards, and how often:For this report, I wanted to know what the exec team was looking at in the past week. I want to know how much they’re looking at the metrics and whether they’re looking at the dashboards I think they should be looking at.@danwolch https://www.danwolch.com/2022/09/analyzing-metabase-usage/"

Is there a voice of the customer segment for your reporting?2. Input vs OutputAre you reporting only on what has already happened or are you showing what’s happening now? Obviously you need both, but in my experience companies rely too heavily on output metrics.3. Flexible vs FixedHow often do you update the metrics you’re reporting on? Are you explicitly designing your metrics to be updated? What’s your feedback loop for checking that inputs actually lead to the right outputs?4. Open vs ClosedWho gets to see the dashboard? How do you ensure that everyone is on the same page? Are you capturing the potential value in a world of orbital stakeholders from opening up the dashboard to a wider set of people?📈📈📈Maybe dashboards and strategic plans need to be more closely entwined?–Update #1: Some good links posted on twitter:  Daniel Schmidt, CEO of Doubleloop wrote about “Flat metrics dashboards”  Consultant Andrew Bartholomew wrote Good Dashboard, Bad Dashboard–Update #2: Some great links here, Clare’s talk is great:It’s an emotional need rather than a functional one. I call it the executive safety blanket. https://t.co/rwoRZcjsrgClare Gollnick’s talk about dashboards points to why:https://t.co/YTUDED0Ibn&mdash; Chris Butler (@chrizbot) May 6, 2022–Update #3: I recorded a podcast episode with my friend Nigel talking all about exec level dashboards:–Update #4: Love this post from the head of data at Reforge, looking at the data(!) around which executives look at which dashboards, and how often:For this report, I wanted to know what the exec team was looking at in the past week. I want to know how much they’re looking at the metrics and whether they’re looking at the dashboards I think they should be looking at.@danwolch https://www.danwolch.com/2022/09/analyzing-metabase-usage/"

  "content": "A monk in 1494 called Luca Pacioli invented double entry accounting. It’s a kind of business infrastructure that enabled modern finance to emerge. By recording changes in two places you create a much more robust and error-resistant system of accounting:Looking back, we see that Venetian bookkeeping proved to be an ideal system for generating the financial statements that were required for the modern industrialized world. It could accurately record capital and income (as required by law and investors), it could distinguish between private expenses and corporate costs, and it could produce data that helped to evaluate past investment decisions. https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/2019/4/26/how-double-entry-bookkeeping-changed-the-worldHere’s a little about it from NPR (with some nice additional color about his potential relationship to da Vinci):Luca Pacioli was a monk, magician and lover of numbers. He discovered this special bookkeeping in Venice and was intrigued by it. In 1494, he wrote a huge math encyclopedia and included an instructional section on double-entry bookkeeping.   Thanks to the newly invented printing press, his book was mass produced and became a big hit. One of the first readers was Leonardo da Vinci, who at the time was painting The Last Supper. Pacioli's encyclopedia had a section on the mathematics of perspective painting which fascinated da Vinci.   \"They were hanging out together....I think they were probably lovers. They certainly spent a lot of time together, and definitely Luca Pacioli was there in the church when Leonardo da Vinci was there in the actual church when Leonardo da Vinci was painting The Last Supper,\" said Gleeson-White.   What Pacioli is known for today, though, is that tiny section of the book about accounting. Today, every country and every business uses double-entry bookkeeping.@NPR https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/10/04/162296423/the-accountant-who-changed-the-world🔢This is a blog without servers. I don’t mean that literally - of course there’s servers (there’s even double entry accounting somewhere in the stack!). But what I mean is that I don’t spend any time on sys admin. I don’t fiddle with server settings or controls. I can’t, there’s nothing to fiddle with!This site is a static site, hosted on Github Pages.I use Github Pages, not because it’s easy (though it is pretty easy), but because it’s simple1. Everything is just text files. It’s markdown mostly with a little sprinkling of HTML. Most of the complicated logic for templating etc is separated from the actual writing so burning this site to the ground and starting from scratch with all my content would be pretty trivial.But there’s a nice benefit to running my blog through Github - I accidentally get triple entry blogging. What is triple entry blogging? Well my whole site is, by default, replicated in three places:  My local machine (stored as text files)  Github creates a robust version, complete with version history  The web at tomcritchlow.com (where all kinds of spiders crawl all over it)There’s no export button - everything is automatically replicated in all three places and you could probably replicate this blog from any of the three copies.This feels like some kind of resilience. I think there might even be a snapshot of my site buried 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain…🔢The magic of double entry bookkeeping, though,  wasn’t just that the records were stored in two places. It wasn’t just a copy - it was a log. It enabled new kinds of accounting to keep track of more complicated transactions.It’s nice to have three copies of my site, but what kinds of new experiences might triple entry blogging enable?Well Github has a very robust API. The nice thing about that is it essentially provides an API to my site too. Imagine you want to create a new blog that feeds in posts from a bunch of different sites. This would be trivial if they all ran on top of Github (also possible via RSS).Or perhaps you wanted to create a search index on top of a bunch of blogs - again, if they all ran on top of Github Pages this would be trivial2 with the Github API.Another nice thing enabled by triple entry blogging is the ability to have a version history and changelog for every blog post. This is something I’ve been meaning to implement for a while. Here’s a how to: Including Git History in a Jekyll Post.What new kinds of things could we build on top of this idea of triple entry blogging?🔢Servers are weird. I’ve constructed this whole blogging setup as a way to never have to think about servers. But actually servers are cool again. Services like Replit and Glitch have become incredible. What started as a kind of easy way to configure a server through the browser has quietly become something…. else?Both Replit and Glitch have “always-on” modes if you pay $7 or $8 / month.Yes, it’s making it easier than ever to write code collaboratively in the browser with zero configuration and setup. That’s amazing! I’m a HUGE believer in this mission.But/and I think there’s something more. The idea that writing server-side code is as easy as writing HTML opens up something new. I can feel the energy in my fingertips - a kind of Internet-Fingerspitzengefühl perhaps.Take Mastodon for example.This is a model of decentralization that still involves servers. Yes, yes I know everything involves servers, chill! What I mean is that it’s a model of decentralization that requires real servers. It requires configuring servers. Because of that it’s both technologically and socially clunky. It requires setup and it requires knowing someone who knows how to configure one.But what happens when writing server-side code is as easy as writing front end code? What happens if - maybe! - there’s a model of decentralization that feels more like a bunch of weird Replits networking with each other. Some kind of richer, smaller, messier mesh. A kind of decentralization that doesn’t require so many people to maintain a bunch of servers…?(Something like Gossips Cafe or Special Fish perhaps?)🔢Here’s a real example. A while back I posted up some thoughts about a decentralized Goodreads: Library JSON - A Proposal for a Decentralized Goodreads.The idea is that a million individual static sites can publish their book lists in a way that allows us to build Goodreads-esque behavior on top of it.There’s two ways to look at this kind of idea - on the one hand you can imagine a Mastodon like approach. Real coding people come along and host some real servers and build robust code that rebuilds a service on top of this open data. To be 100% clear I think this would be batshit cool! Imagine a centralized service that you can log into, create an account and use just like Goodreads - except under the hood it’s fully interop with this open data spec. You can interact side by side with data on the platform and data spread across these personal sites. Magic.But there’s another way to look at this idea - instead of the “Mastodon appraoch” we take the “Replit approach”. This way, there’s no servers (you know what I mean!) - just some hackers and hobbyists writing a bit of front-end and back-end javascript to create a million little libraries. Some of them might end up being big (think the NYPL!). Big, popular, robust services consuming and creating book data. But most of them will be small neighborhood libraries. Maybe they’re friends in a book club. Or a books version of a blog ring. Who knows. Tiny libraries.Here’s a super rough proof of concept Replit tiny library. I’ve never written nodeJS code before and managed to copy and paste together a little thing that takes a library.json file and turns it into a library. Right now it only iterates over a single library but it’s easy to imagine how to extend this to include a feed, info across library files etc etc. I’m gonna get to all that, I jut haven’t had time.🔢Talking of libraries and decentralized social media… Maybe actual libraries are part of the answer?These are the five core principles of the Brooklyn Public Library. Feels like you could certainly support these efforts with some kind of social space... pic.twitter.com/XGU789dawe&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) April 26, 2022Maybe the library of the future need to think about creating and consuming content? From a lovely paper in 2006 (!): “In the new digital libraries, users are not only consumers but also producers of information”:New DLs are also required to offer a much richer set of services to theirusers than in the past. In particular, they must support the activities of their usersby providing functionalities that may range from general utilities, like annotation,summarization or co-operative work support, to very audience-specific functions,like map processing, semantic analysis of images, or simulation. The availability ofthis new DL functionality can, in principle, change the way in which research isconducted. By exploiting such types of DL, for example, a scientist can annotatethe article of a colleague with a programme that extracts useful information from alarge amount of data collected by a specific scientific observatory. Thisprogramme, executed on demand when the annotation is accessed, cancomplement the content of the paper with continuously refreshed information.In the new DLs users are not only consumers but also producers ofinformation. By elaborating information gathered through the DL they can createnew information objects that are published in the DL, thus enriching its content.The new DLs are thus required to offer services that support the authoring of thesenew objects and the workflows that lead to their publication. Donatella Castelli https://www.researchgate.net/publication/28804446_Digital_Libraries_of_the_Future_-_and_the_Role_of_Libraries🔢Triple entry blogging doesn’t sound like the kind of thing to change the world. But then again, neither does double entry accounting.            Github feels very scary and has stupid language that makes no sense. But once you get over that it’s not that hard. I manage everything from the Github desktop client, I don’t use the command line. &#8617;              “Trivial” in the mathematical sense of being beyond my capabilities but theoretically possible and straightforward for someone more capable than me. &#8617;      "

But we have a technology that nicely describes a bundle of feeds - OPML.OPML is an outliner technology that simply links to a bunch of feeds. Here’s an example of an OPML file from Vaughn Tan. Nice.The problem with feeds is that they render in the browser like a bunch of code. They’re not at all user friendly. That’s why Matt Webb made aboutfeeds.com to both help people understand what a feed is and to help people who provide RSS feeds to style them nicely. I use the styling on my RSS feed to make it render properly.Turns out you can do the same thing with OPML files. Here’s an OPML file nicely styled for the browser.Viewing a list of feeds isn’t particularly useful though. What you really want is to be able to see what Dave Winer calls the river of content.

This is the flow of content from the 280 feeds I follow: /feeds.My personal feed is generated using a Google Docs script because it’s a technology I know how to code. It’s creaking at this point and I need something more robust - you know using a technology more advanced than a hyperlinked spreadsheet.Turns out Dave Winer has the technology. River5 is his tech stack using NodeJS to fetch RSS feeds (and OPML files) and present the river of content.One click import into Replit appears to just work! Here’s an example of River5 running on my personal list of RSS feeds above: https://tomcritchlow-rss.tomcritchlow.repl.co/.I think there’s something quietly radical about making your feed reader open by default. It increases the surface area of RSS so others can discover content more easily. It makes blogging more visible.The nice thing about RSS and OPML is that’s a very extensible spec. The file format is flexible, you can define your own schema and fields. This might open up new kinds of publishing.I wrote about my idea for Library.json a while back. It’s this idea that we might be able to rebuild these monolithic centralized services like Goodreads using nothing by a little RSS. Matt Webb wrote up some nice thoughts about how to implement Library.json using OPML here.

  "title": "Notes on teaching & chairs",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/04/06/teaching/",
  "date": "April 6, 2022",
  "content": "I fell asleep in a lecture once. The lecture hall was so crowded, there must have been over 200 students in the hall, so I was sat on the steps of the lecture theatre at the back. This is at Warwick where I studied mathematics - the lecture was likely on something like Linear Algebra.Of course I fell asleep in lots of lectures (it didn’t help that my classes had names like Algebra I, Algebra II and Algebra III) - but I remember this one in particular because I was sat on the steps instead of a nice comfy bench. I was falling asleep despite being sprawled on the uncomfortable steps.The classroom chair. The long benches of a lecture theatre. The stairs I fell asleep on. Chairs and education seems somehow emotionally entwined. Picture a classroom and you’ll think of rows and rows of chairs facing the blackboard. The idea that you should sit down and listen.🪑I’ve spent the last year teaching in earnest, building the first SEO MBA course (that launched last year) and now running a beta of the new course that will come out in a few months. So of course I’m thinking about chairs.The biggest surprise building the SEO MBA is quite simply how hard teaching is. As a teacher, you really want the process to be as simple as explaining the concepts in a linear fashion. Sit down everyone, I’ve got some teaching to tell you about. But unfortunately it’s not nearly so simple.You see the goal of teaching is not to get people to simply remember what you said - it’s to be able to apply that learning in context. For teaching to be effective it has to be felt in the bones. You need students to examine, unlearn and relearn concepts. It’s about reshaping mental models of how the world works.I’m still learning how to teach (ha!). But I’ve found that when constructing a syllabus or a lesson there’s a kind of framework I follow. Maybe this is old news for teachers. It goes something like this:  First figure out what the goal is for your students. Ideally you try and write this as a statement: after completing this course they will be able to…  Understand what the current level of understanding is. What are the pre-existing approaches, mental models and experience of your students? For the courses I’ve been teaching I run a survey before I start to try and tease out these things.  Decide on the content of the teaching. What are the topics you want to teach (that meet your students where they are and teach them the skills to meet their goals)?      Find ways to communicate each concept clearly so that it’s easy to grasp and hard to confuse, even for people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences.    Points 1-3 are relatively straightforward. 4 is harder. I’ve found that there’s a huge gap between knowing a concept and being able to explain it clearly. If you get through 1-4 you’re doing pretty well as a teacher. But you’re still just telling them what you want them to know.    There’s more you can do:    Find examples, data points and evidence that what you’re teaching is true. It’s one thing to make an assertion like “Your presentation should have an executive summary” and quite another thing to find evidence for your claim. Can you convince your students to both care about what you’re saying AND believe you?  Find some stories that deepen the emotional connection to the subject. Why is this stuff important? Why do you care? What are real examples from the world that show this learning in action?  Shift the teaching from telling to showing - find ways for students to come to their own insights. The highest artform of this is to never once tell the student what you want them to know, but to allow them to arrive there themselves.  Once you’ve done all of these things, finally, you need to make it entertaining. You need to make the teaching experience capture their attention for extended periods of time.1Likely your first attempt to teach something will cover something like 1-4. Points 5-8 are harder. And there are likely levels to this I’ve not even thought of yet.Interestingly, this is a framework for taking the same materials and continuing to revisit and expand it over time. Every class that you teach is an opportunity to improve the stories, or add examples, or explain something more clearly. You’re not changing the what you’re teaching, but changing how you teach it. And that makes a big difference.An average teacher starts by explaining the concept, telling you what you’re going to learn and then breaks down the topics.A great teacher shows up in a fish suit, punches you in the gut and tickles you - making you realize how important oxygen is and forcing you to reexamine your relationship to air.🪑Do you remember when Facebook ran that ad about how Chairs are like Facebook? Unironically!But, talking of memes and chairs and learning… My friend Jonathan is building new startup around the idea that memes are a revolutionary educational tool. His thesis? That you can’t meme something you don’t understand:Shitposting. There’s an unusually intuitive framework for learning called Bloom’s Taxonomy, which emphasizes that Creation and Evaluation are the highest form of learning. Why? Because exposition often, but not always, relies on regurgitation and repetition (the bottom of Bloom’s Taxonomy), whereas creating something new based on the subject matter relies not only on a fundamental understanding of that subject but also the opposing opinions on that subject (also see Bryan Caplan’s Ideological Turing Test). It’s impossible to tell good jokes about subjects you don’t fully understand, and very difficult to tell jokes that people with opposing opinions will enjoy and grapple with. To accomplish the latter you need to be informed enough about opposing opinion, generous enough to take it seriously, and above all confident enough to tell a joke that, taken at face value, inverts your actual opinion. This is shitposting. https://whoo.ps/2022/04/05/shitposting-is-the-highest-form-of-consciousnessThere’s a great 4 min video here that explains that relationship and shows a bit of the Antimatter experience.Maybe beyond my levels 1-8 above there are things you can do with teaching like memes that make the concepts memorable, shareable. Imagine every course you teach coming with a meme, imagine every student creating a meme about your course! Memes as memory palaces built for the network age.🪑Teaching is hard enough. But it’s even harder, if what you’re trying to teach is tacit knowledge:Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone.Think about riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle is impossible to teach through descriptions. Sure, you can try to explain what it is you’re doing when you’re cycling, but this isn’t going to be of much help when you’re teaching a kid and they fall into the drain while you’re telling them to “BALANCE! JUST IMAGINE YOU ARE ON A TIGHTROPE AND BALANCE!”.What is more important is emulation, and action — that is, a focus on the embodied feelings necessary to ride a bicycle successfully. And this exercise was quite magical for me, for within the span of an hour I could watch a kid go from conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.In other words, tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/Cedric’s writing on Tacit Knowledge is wonderful. I’ve been sitting down with it trying to really understand and internalize it.One of the most challenging things about tacit knowledge is that just because you’re an expert at something doesn’t mean you can explain it or teach it. In fact, it’s worse than that, if you force experts to explain how to do something they’ll make it up:  And if you press them enough, they’ll start making stuff up. The way that experts do, because they want to give you an answer.This from a great post The Tricky Thing About Creating Training Programs.This is why I have steps 5 and 6 in my list. I’m trying to keep my own BS in check. Sometimes I try and explain a concept and struggle to find evidence or stories of that principle in action. This is a red flag that suggests maybe I’m making it up.🪑Talking of tacit knowledge and chairs… There’s this lovely paper about a program where students buy a chair, deconstruct it and then repair it. Redoing by Repair: The Search for Tacit KnowledgeTransfer in Furniture Design Education:The famous quote from Polanyi (1966) “We know more than we can tell.” explains the most for tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is the untellable knowledge embedded in the product. The best way to reveal it is to have a dialogue who has the knowledge. Once the tacit has been made explicit to make it one’s own tacit knowledge it is needed to be practiced. In interior design furniture class these methods are evaluated through repair theme as the mediator of the dialogue.Repair is an act of seeing the product as a whole and not as the parts specifically. This situation suits to Polanyi’s thoughts on tacit knowledge that knowledge is a whole and cannot be separated. In furniture class, the chair is treated as an object to be repaired by a craftsman. Students approached the chair to reveal the tacit knowledge and create a dialogue to whom have this knowledge.The purpose of the class has not been to make each student a repairman or a crafts person. It has been to make students understand that there is a greater tacit dimension in production of furniture, even greater than the explicit knowledge thought in the class.@ResearchGate https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331375278_Redoing_by_Repair_The_Search_for_Tacit_KnowledgeTransfer_in_Furniture_Design_EducationThis is how great teaching works - by taking something that you know, something you think you understand, like a chair - and forcing you to deconstruct the chair and put it back together again.You could re-frame step 2 in my teaching process not just as understanding your students level of expertise, but understanding your students mental models. This is hard to do. And it’s challenging - you’re challenging your students and the way they see the world. Viewed through this lens teaching becomes a political act. You’re changing the world by changing your students.🪑Teaching after all, is not neutral (bolding mine):Education is never a neutral process. It either functions as an instrument to integrate new generations into the logic of a present system, or it can be the means by which students are allowed to critically deal with their reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their future—in other words, education as a practice of liberation. No matter what we believe, we all should at least be transparent about our approaches. Every student should have the right to know what kind of learning processes they are about to enter.And of course, one is more likely to support education as a model of integration if one benefits from or has never felt threatened by the status quo. In this case, this system is likely invisible to you. In liberatory educational practices, it is as important to recognize one’s role as an educator as it is to identify and name power. This should never be confused with freeing yourself, as a teacher, from your responsibilities. Even if I believe in co-created knowledge and use methods to make individual experiences and knowledge visible, it is my responsibility to organize studies in ways that increase each student’s chances to reach learning outcomes. If a student fails, this failure is also mine.@futuress_org https://futuress.org/magazine/teach-what-you-need-to-learn/Oh!Ok, listen I’m teaching something called the SEO MBA. I’m not exactly changing the world. Except there is an ideology and status quo that I’m railing against and it’s good to be explicit about it. You could call what I’m railing against something like “SEO audit culture” - I’m fighting for a better way to view SEO as a systemic, complex initiative inside organizations. To see a full accounting of what SEO takes, to examine more closely whether SEO is worth it.So my courses are like little trojan horses burrowing into people’s mental models to try and help them see the world a little more clearly.🪑Anyway. I’m just here sat in a chair, thinking about teaching, tacit knowledge, memes and mental models.            Level 8 will forever now be referred to as bezier butts. &#8617;      "

Opening doors and opportunities - leading to friendships, jobs, clients and more. It’s hard to overstate the impact it’s had.And yet of the people I know “in real life” very few are bloggers.Over the years I’ve tried various ways to encourage people to blog. I tried a thing called NYCBlogClub with a group of friends - the idea was to blog once a week for 10 weeks (there were 10 of us so this would have been 100 blog posts between us). I think we managed a handful of posts before the whole thing petered out.Then I tried a private slack group where we’d meet once a week and try and move a few people intentionally from “not blogging” to “blogging”. None of that stuck either.It’s all still a bit of a mystery how to get people writing online. Some of the resistance I hear:  Technical barriers and setup problems  Not knowing what to write about  Insecurity about publishing for “everyone” to see  Not wanting your identity be as a “blogger” (which some see as a negative thing)  Not keeping going after writing online and nothing happeningThere are a few programs out there that will get you writing online. Write of passage is very expensive, and yet does seem to work, at least for some people. Packy McCormick went through Write of Passage and then launched Not Boring. And Seth Godin’s altMBA program is actually largely about doing projects and then writing about them online.Perhaps the most successful thing I’ve done to help get people blogging is by changing people’s mental model of blogging from one of prestige and polish to one of punk and plants. My two most well-read blog posts:  Small b blogging about writing for small audiences and keeping it weird  Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens about digital gardening and writing as a means of inquiryBut the question remains and still bugs me. How do you get people to start and sustain an online writing practice?Here’s some notes I had while biking:A Blogging AcceleratorThe idea is to make a blogging accelerator. Only you don’t call it anything to do with blogging. Instead you just make it an interesting project that people engage in, with a by-product being writing up the project online.The thesis is this: don’t tell people they should be blogging or explain to them why to blog but instead trick them into writing online and show them how the magic works. Get them to feel it for themselves.So.There’s two concepts, they’re both very similar:1) Pixel PoetsIt’s a 5 week course to engage more closely with poetry and more closely with the web.  Week 1: Poetry &amp; The Web - We look at why poetry is cool and why the web is cool. We explore things like Poetry APIs, people like Allison Parrish and digital poetry experiences like the NYT’s Close Read series.  Week 2: Choose a poem - Pick a poem and read it closely. Perhaps we’d do things like typesetting the poem in HTML (using a platform like Glitch) or copy and pasting the poem into a Google Doc and annotating it with a small group. Mostly this is about a) getting comfortable doing little scrappy web things and b) looking closely at poetry  Week 3: Choose a theme - Now you’ve got your poem and you’ve spent some time with, choose a specific idea, theme or aspect of the poem to highlight. It could be the backstory of the poet, or a specific word/stanza. But you want to start to explore possible projects and experiments that you could do to focus on that theme.  Week 4: Make your experiment - Now you have your poem, your theme and your possible experiments you pick a particular direction and build a web experience around your poem and theme. It could be as simple as designing a layout and web-page dedicated to your poem. Or it could be an interactive experience. Or whatever - I expect the output of this will be a constant source of delight and surprise.  Week 5: Finish your project and write it up - Actually building your experience and polishing it will take longer than a week so let’s factor in another week for polish and refinement. AND - you have to write up a “making of” essay. This is a kind of personal motivation, technical how-to about how the project came together and why this poem means something to you. You have to email that essay to 5 people.The idea is that you’d run this a cohort so people can have group discussion, make friends, bounce ideas off each other and maybe even collaborate on projects. I think this sounds like fun! But/and the kicker is that you have to write one essay a week about your experience in the group.People aspire to be “poetry people” and instead we teach them to be bloggers by doing something interesting and writing about it. Sneaky.2) Digital WalkersIt’s a 5 week course to engage more closely with walking &amp; nature, and more closely with the web.  Week 1: Walking &amp; The Web - We look at why walking is cool, and why the web is cool. We’d explore things like Jane’s Walk and people like Craig Mod and Christopher Goddard.  Week 2: Choose a walk - Here we pick a particular walk. Doesn’t have to be a “big” walk - in fact it might be better if it’s not. Something ordinary, mundane or urban could be totally fine. Pick a walk or area that you’re interested in. You should make a little web-hosted repository for your research to get comfortable putting things on the web, even if it’s a simple list of links.  Week 3: Choose a theme &amp; choose experiments - Now that you’ve got your walk we’ll look at exploring some themes. Making maps, researching the history of the area and looking at the geography of the walk in more detail. What does this walk mean to you? We’ll create a list of ways to experience the walk using the internet.  Week 4: Pick an experiment and do the walk! - Narrow down your ideas to the one you’re going to do. Then you do the walk! You’ll likely be recording some kind of media during the walk so you need to have at least some idea of what you’re going to make before you start - but of course I imagine that after doing the walk you’re more inspired and creatively energized than before you did the walk.  Week 5: Make the project and write it up - Here we build the web experience / companion / piece. Is it simply a collection of photos of the walk? A fully interactive walk experience? Binaural audio from the walk? Who knows. Could be simple, could be fancy. Once you’ve made your cool web experience you have to ALSO write a personal essay with a behind the scenes “how to” of choosing the walk and making the web experience.The idea is that you’d run this a cohort so people can have group discussion, make friends, bounce ideas off each other and maybe even collaborate on projects. I think this sounds like fun! But/and the kicker is that you have to write one essay a week about your experience in the group.People aspire to be go on more walks and spend more time in nature and instead we teach them to be bloggers by doing something interesting and writing about it. Sneaky.Would this be a more effective vehicle for getting people to start blogging? I don’t know but.. maybe? Seems like fun either way.If I get enough time I’d love to get these projects off the ground. I’m blogging them here as a way to perhaps create some interest and kickstart some serendipity. Maybe I was too obvious about the sneaky trojan horse blogging thing?In the meantime, I’ve been collecting some links related to pixel poets and digital walkers over on Are.na. If you have cool resources, essays and links for either interest send them to me, I wanna explore these spaces more!"

  "title": "Building a Digital Homestead, Bit by Brick",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2022/03/08/architecture-blogging/",
  "date": "March 8, 2022",
  "content": "A personal site, or a blog, is more than just a collection of writing. It’s a kind of place - something that feels like home among the streams. Home is a very strong mental model.I’ve talked before about streams, campfires and gardens. But what about digital homes?“Home” has a certain kind of emotion. I love Winnie Lim’s meditation on a website feeling like home:I would like this to be a space where I primarily – other people too if they want to – can retreat to, sip a cup of tea, immerse in the content or browse lightly for a bit, an online space where people can slow down and breathe. There is almost no one else here, no social signalling or noise, no sense of competition or completion, almost nothing and yet everything.Winnie Lim https://winnielim.org/experiments/website/envisioning-my-homepage-as-an-online-therapeutic-space/And homes are built - Frank Chimero’s piece on building a digital homestead always resonates with me:Have you ever visited an architect’s house, one they designed themselves? It’s fun to walk through it with them. They have so many things, arranged so thoughtfully, and share the space with such pride because of the personal reflection the house required to design (not to mention the effort it took to build). It’s really quite special. I think there’s a pleasure to having everything under one roof. You feel together, all of you at once. In a way, building your own house is the ultimate project for a creative person: you’re making a home for what you think is important, done in the way you think is best.@archiveis https://archive.ph/2013.12.27-041357/http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/This notion that building something allows you to embed your own style, taste and ideas into not just the content but the layout, structure. The walls are alive with your intentions.And, much like a homestead, personal sites are never finished. They can be extended, re-built, maintained, polished, fixed. Brian Lovin has this wonderful meditaiton on incrementally correct personal sites:Incremental correctness is the process of iterating towards something more truthful, accurate, usable, or interesting. The faster we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but tomorrow things can be slightly closer to perfect.Incremental correctness changes everything about the way you work. It's anti-perfectionism. It's pro-generation. It's about discovery and proof, research and prototyping, and having a framework to reliably test your instincts. It discourages major redesigns, preferring isolated improvements to a small subset of nodes in any kind of working tree.I've always struggled to have this mindset when working on my personal website. I get stuck in these loops where I redesign the thing once every few years, and am left so thoroughly exhausted and frustrated by the process that I don't want to touch the thing ever again. If you've ever dreaded the notion of having to redesign your portfolio, you probably know what I mean.@brian_lovin https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websitesSo there’s something brewing here - something about building a digital homestead, building it in a way that reflects your soul.And the idea of building is interesting. Not gardens and streams but architecture! What kind of architecture is necessary for a blog? Perhaps it’s a geometry of irregular shapes, of bricolage. As Alan Jacobs writes in architectural blogging:I think a lot about blogging, about why I like it, what I think I can accomplish through blogging that I can’t accomplish, or not easily anyway, through other kinds of writing … and that leads me to metaphors. For instance, I have appropriated from Brian Eno and others the distinction between architecture and gardening, and have described my blog as a kind of garden. But lately I’ve been revisiting the architecture/gardening distinction and I have come to think that there is something architectural about writing a blog, or can be – but not in the sense of a typical architectural project, which is designed in advanced and built to specifications. Rather, writing a blog over a period of years is something like building the Watts Towers: https://blog.ayjay.org/revisiting-architectural-blogging/From these meditations on the architecture of blogging three questions emerge:  How do you create pathways (and desire paths?) through your site? How do people start, journey, get lost and ultimately find their way through your site? I recently added a “start here” section to my writing page but I’ve been tinkering with blogchains and series of writing. What other structures emerge?  How to archive, index and search? I recently re-architected how search works on my site.

  "content": "A personal site, or a blog, is more than just a collection of writing. It’s a kind of place - something that feels like home among the streams. Home is a very strong mental model.I’ve talked before about streams, campfires and gardens. But what about digital homes?“Home” has a certain kind of emotion. I love Winnie Lim’s meditation on a website feeling like home:I would like this to be a space where I primarily – other people too if they want to – can retreat to, sip a cup of tea, immerse in the content or browse lightly for a bit, an online space where people can slow down and breathe. There is almost no one else here, no social signalling or noise, no sense of competition or completion, almost nothing and yet everything.Winnie Lim https://winnielim.org/experiments/website/envisioning-my-homepage-as-an-online-therapeutic-space/And homes are built - Frank Chimero’s piece on building a digital homestead always resonates with me:Have you ever visited an architect’s house, one they designed themselves? It’s fun to walk through it with them. They have so many things, arranged so thoughtfully, and share the space with such pride because of the personal reflection the house required to design (not to mention the effort it took to build). It’s really quite special. I think there’s a pleasure to having everything under one roof. You feel together, all of you at once. In a way, building your own house is the ultimate project for a creative person: you’re making a home for what you think is important, done in the way you think is best.@archiveis https://archive.ph/2013.12.27-041357/http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/12/homesteading-2014/This notion that building something allows you to embed your own style, taste and ideas into not just the content but the layout, structure. The walls are alive with your intentions.And, much like a homestead, personal sites are never finished. They can be extended, re-built, maintained, polished, fixed. Brian Lovin has this wonderful meditaiton on incrementally correct personal sites:Incremental correctness is the process of iterating towards something more truthful, accurate, usable, or interesting. The faster we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but tomorrow things can be slightly closer to perfect.Incremental correctness changes everything about the way you work. It's anti-perfectionism. It's pro-generation. It's about discovery and proof, research and prototyping, and having a framework to reliably test your instincts. It discourages major redesigns, preferring isolated improvements to a small subset of nodes in any kind of working tree.I've always struggled to have this mindset when working on my personal website. I get stuck in these loops where I redesign the thing once every few years, and am left so thoroughly exhausted and frustrated by the process that I don't want to touch the thing ever again. If you've ever dreaded the notion of having to redesign your portfolio, you probably know what I mean.@brian_lovin https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websitesSo there’s something brewing here - something about building a digital homestead, building it in a way that reflects your soul.And the idea of building is interesting. Not gardens and streams but architecture! What kind of architecture is necessary for a blog? Perhaps it’s a geometry of irregular shapes, of bricolage. As Alan Jacobs writes in architectural blogging:I think a lot about blogging, about why I like it, what I think I can accomplish through blogging that I can’t accomplish, or not easily anyway, through other kinds of writing … and that leads me to metaphors. For instance, I have appropriated from Brian Eno and others the distinction between architecture and gardening, and have described my blog as a kind of garden. But lately I’ve been revisiting the architecture/gardening distinction and I have come to think that there is something architectural about writing a blog, or can be – but not in the sense of a typical architectural project, which is designed in advanced and built to specifications. Rather, writing a blog over a period of years is something like building the Watts Towers: https://blog.ayjay.org/revisiting-architectural-blogging/From these meditations on the architecture of blogging three questions emerge:  How do you create pathways (and desire paths?) through your site? How do people start, journey, get lost and ultimately find their way through your site? I recently added a “start here” section to my writing page but I’ve been tinkering with blogchains and series of writing. What other structures emerge?  How to archive, index and search? I recently re-architected how search works on my site. It’s not finished yet but I hope to use search as a way to search not only my site but all kinds of other stuff: my bookmarks, my wiki, my notes, my tweets even. Search can be a way to go down rabbitholes. Inspiration: Building Monocle, a universal personal search engine for life.

That was designed for web foraging?Say hello to ⚡ Electric Tables. It’s a little research project and prototype to explore the idea of structured data, personal databases and web as texture.It’s pretty simple. It looks something like this:Electric Tables works by taking a URL, extracting some key data and adding it to a table.It works by using a bookmarklet and local storage. So there’s no login and no database in V0.1.Simply click it on a page you want to save and you’ll see something like this:Notice how it automatically extracts basic information like title and image? Neat. When we try it on a Target page for example notice how it grabs the price and review score automatically?Or when we try it on a recipe page it automatically extracts the ingredients into a list:You can change which table it saves to in the dropdown at the top (it defaults to the last used). And you can edit or add fields of data by adding rows.Try it yourself by dragging this bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar:+ Electric TablesThen, view your tables here: https://electric-tables.glitch.me/Or watch the 3 minute demo here:Some NotesA few things to note:  You can add notes against every item in the table.

DM me and I can walk you through it)When a page is saved, it’ll try and grab structured data from the page such as:  URL, title, open graph image  Schema data like: price, address, recipe ingredients  It’ll also save any text you have highlighted on the page into a “selection” field!Note, because of technical reasons (content security policies) some sites (e.g. Twitter, Airbnb) will add to Electric Tables, but in a new tab instead of using a pop-up and it won’t grab much additional data..In addition to this (for power users only!) there’s an options page where you can write your own custom selectors:These are rules that map domain filters to custom extractors. This is useful because data extraction is always going to be fragile. Web pages change. Some pages (e.g. Amazon) are actively hostile to data extraction. And the web is vast and weird. I want Electric Tables to be a general purpose tool. This options page provides a quick and easy-ish way to write your own custom extractors on a domain by domain basis…Maybe in the future you could imagine sharing / uploading custom extraction lists. Kind of like an open scraping database!What Electric Tables Could BeElectric Tables V0.1 is really just a sketch. It’s a working prototype but it’s pretty rough around the edges. It still has bugs and doesn’t really do all the things I’d want it to. But I wanted to release it early to get feedback and figure out what to do with it. Should I invest time in making it robust and polished? Would someone else who can actually code run with it and build a better version?There are a variety of solutions out there that do things a bit like Electric Tables but none of them seem quite right…  Spreadsheets are cumbersome and slow. I’ll build a Google Doc to compare things but only when the stakes are high enough… And firing up a new spreadsheet is slooooow. Adding URLs to a spreadsheet is time consuming as you have to copy and paste fields one by one.  Airtable is perhaps the closest comparison to Electric Tables - allowing for tables of data and some limited web extraction. But again - it feels too heavy for the kinds of lightweight uses I’m proposing…  Are.na is interesting - it’s the perhaps a close cousin in terms of saving URLs to “tables” (channels in Arena language). Are.na does a little bit of the extraction pulling a screenshot, title etc from the page but doesn’t go far enough (and the UI is clunky as you save over 10-20 URLs into a channel, it’s not really designed for comparing and list making)  Rows.com is kind of like a supercharged spreadsheet (and I like how they have little tables in the UI vs one infinite canvas) but it’s still too “spreadsheety” and is geared heavily to the enterprise (LinkedIn search, Crunchbase search etc). Still, I like the spirit.I’m not sure where it goes from here, but here are some directions I’d be excited about:Hosted &amp; CollaborativeRight now Electric Tables stores data in Chrome localstorage. There’s no database. It’s easy to imagine that this could run on a server where the data extraction is done both client side by the bookmarklet AND server side by fetching and crawling the URL.Once you have a hosted version and the data stored in a database you can do some key things like collaborate on tables! This is a huge and basic feature that’s just a bit outside of my coding abilities unfortunately. Imagine being able to quickly spin up a table for a list of URLs and just share it by sharing the URL. Whether it’s collaborating on a list of potential Airbnbs or gift ideas for the holidays.The server side scraping can also do some more heavy lifting - such as store the entire page contents in the database. This enables full text search, the ability to re-crawl URLs and more.This is all technically very feasible - but requires a lot more infrastructure to build things like login, databases and URL crawling…Saving &amp; Publishing?Finally - what if Electric Tables wasn’t just about saving, but about publishing too?It’s frustrating to me that most CMSs don’t really handle tabluated data. I’m using a static site so it’s even worse but even on this site I do things like maintain a list of books or music in a YAML file format:Or, maintain a list of RSS feeds in a spreadsheet:What if both of these could be powered by Electric Tables?

To promote diverse voices and encourage networked writing to flourish.It’s built in collaboration with Toby Shorin and I couldn’t agree more with Toby when he says “We’re not so good at maintaining it, but it’s one of my favorite projects.”Amen to that.Anyway - we just pushed a new version live in the Chrome store with a few bits and bobs:Full Article Saving &amp; Bug FixingThe chrome extension1 now saves both the highlighted quote AND the full text from the page you’re on. You can toggle between them in a new “article view” in the dashboard (see the link “click me for article view”):We’re using readability.js under the hood to extract the full article text so you can save and read it right inside the extension.In addition - there’s a few minor bug fixes, most notably we’ve tweaked the manifest so it should work for Linux users (hopefully! I don’t have a machine to test it on).Check out the latest version here.The Future of Quotebacks?At this point I think it’s fair to assume limited future releases from Toby and I. Everything works pretty well and I’m pleased we got it to this point. Given everything Toby and I have on our plates I think it’s unlikely we’ll extend Quotebacks into the more ambitious territory of hosting quotes in a centralized database or creating some kind of analytics layer…I’m going to keep maintaining the extension and you never know - if inspiration strikes I think there’s potential for some interesting future directions. But for now let’s not expect those any time soon!But - if you have ideas or suggestions we’d love to hear them. Are you using Quotebacks? What bugs are you finding? What did you wish it could do? Drop us a note.            Firefox will be updated soon when I can figure out how to navigate their approvals process again. Soon hopefully. &#8617;      "

To promote diverse voices and encourage networked writing to flourish.It’s built in collaboration with Toby Shorin and I couldn’t agree more with Toby when he says “We’re not so good at maintaining it, but it’s one of my favorite projects.”Amen to that.Anyway - we just pushed a new version live in the Chrome store with a few bits and bobs:Full Article Saving &amp; Bug FixingThe chrome extension1 now saves both the highlighted quote AND the full text from the page you’re on. You can toggle between them in a new “article view” in the dashboard (see the link “click me for article view”):We’re using readability.js under the hood to extract the full article text so you can save and read it right inside the extension.In addition - there’s a few minor bug fixes, most notably we’ve tweaked the manifest so it should work for Linux users (hopefully! I don’t have a machine to test it on).Check out the latest version here.The Future of Quotebacks?At this point I think it’s fair to assume limited future releases from Toby and I. Everything works pretty well and I’m pleased we got it to this point. Given everything Toby and I have on our plates I think it’s unlikely we’ll extend Quotebacks into the more ambitious territory of hosting quotes in a centralized database or creating some kind of analytics layer…I’m going to keep maintaining the extension and you never know - if inspiration strikes I think there’s potential for some interesting future directions. But for now let’s not expect those any time soon!But - if you have ideas or suggestions we’d love to hear them. Are you using Quotebacks? What bugs are you finding? What did you wish it could do? Drop us a note.            Firefox will be updated soon when I can figure out how to navigate their approvals process again. Soon hopefully. &#8617;      "

  "date": "November 12, 2021",
  "content": "7 years ago I became an independent consultant.Well, that’s not entirely true is it? 7 years ago I quit my job. But it took a while longer to feel comfortable in my own skin, to settle into an identity and to really feel like I could call myself “an independent consultant”.This process of becoming is never ending. Discovering and crafting an identity you feel comfortable with is hard - and not something that full-time employment prepares you well for. I know that a lot of people find the “consultant” label distasteful but personally I’ve always felt comfortable using it which has resolved a lot of mental anguish1. I know indie “consultants” who are still struggling to define themselves 5+ years into being indie and I feel for them…But the winds of change have begun to blow. Last week I launched the SEO MBA course and started building non-consulting revenue for the first time…. Am I creator now? Am I in the creator economy? Let’s talk about that in more detail.First, some highlights from year 7:  We spent the first 18 months of the pandemic on an extended road trip across the US which was an amazing wonderful adventure against the backdrop of such an awful year. The kids learned to love nature and hiking and we saw so much!  Nowhere on our travels felt quite like home though and we’ve been back in Brooklyn since August. Feels peaceful to call this place home.  Roxy started Kindergarten, lost her first tooth and got her first vaccine. Life comes at you fast!  Indy learned so much about everything and just this past week learned how to hop.  Partly driven by our extended road trip and partly by the pandemic consulting has been way less consistent this year than in previous years. But I’ve worked on some amazing projects recently and am excited to continue to explore interesting consulting work.Here’s the full arc of my consulting career. Each color is a different client, size = revenue. Note, this is just consulting revenue and it doesn’t yet include SEO MBA course sales…Some big themes and reflections from year 7:The SEO MBA - Look Mum, I’m a Creator Now!While hiking through Arches, Bryce and Zion last year I had a lot of time to think. At times I’d be hiking with Indy in the backpack, Roxy would be hiking next to Erin and I could just let my mind wander.I kept thinking about this idea of “the business of content” and how I had a lot I wanted to write about. Maybe I could start a substack! But I kept coming back to this idea that I had plenty on my plate between consulting work, traveling and writing my book.However the idea wouldn’t let me go and as I continued to lead building SEO teams and hiring senior SEO talent for my clients it suddenly struck me that this “business of content” theme could be given a very valuable and concrete focus by making it about SEO x business and directly addressing the skills gap in the industry that I was seeing.And thus the SEO MBA was born. I registered the domain in January 2021 and got to work.  The initial email launch far exceeded my expectations and made me realize I struck a chord with the positioning  The continued feedback from the emails validated that not only was the positioning strong but people really appreciated the content  I ran the first course beta in April with a small cohort. Tickets sold out in 20 mins  I ran the second course beta in October with another cohort. Tickets sold out in 8 mins.  Last week I launched the full self-paced course and have been humbled by the response.This is the first time I’m generating meaningful revenue that’s not directly consulting revenue. I guess I’m a creator now?I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who assume that the SEO MBA course was motivated by trying to “get off the treadmill of consulting” and “generate passive income”. And… that’s not it. The dust hasn’t settled yet since I launched the course so it’s too early to tell what the true impact is going to be, but my core motivation for the course was:  Teaching is something I draw deep satisfaction from. I really enjoy it and value it and unfortunately have not had a lot of opportunity to do this being an independent consultant. The SEO MBA is at it’s heart about education. Designing a curriculum, helping shape people’s mental models, creating effective teaching tools. These are all fun and interesting and meaningful!  The most rewarding thing I’ve done in my career was leading a team of consultants at Distilled and watching junior talent become more senior and spread their wings. Supporting people through career growth is extremely rewarding. My aspiration with the SEO MBA is to bend the arc of people’s careers a bit - to help people get pay rises, promotions and new jobs. To feel more confident in their work. I don’t know how many people I’ll reach this deeply or how effective this course will be but that’s my dream.  Honestly from working in SEO and working outside of it, I can feel the skills gap so keenly. The SEO MBA kept calling to me as something that needed to exist in the world. It’s hard to fight that.  Putting together an online course (and a well-read Substack) is a whole new set of skills! Learning about curriculum design, video shooting, lighting! Oh my. It’s fun to scratch some new itches and explore some new skills, even if not super deeply. I’m happy with how the final video content came out, though I can already see how the next course (hmm?!) might be even better.While launch week has been amazing - it’s already clear to me that passive income is anything but. I can see now that if I wanted to, the SEO MBA could be 100% of my income in 2022. But it would require a significant time investment! From where I’m standing now it feels on par with consulting.What’s been unexpected is that impact on consulting. Already a lot of my consulting work this year has been generated through the SEO MBA email! Just positioning myself there and writing that content has generated some interesting work.All in for 2021 I expect the SEO MBA course + consulting clients will account for 2/3 of my overall revenue.That said, I just kicked off a new consulting client this week so I’m not hanging up the gloves just yet :)Four Dream Consulting Gigs - All Very DifferentSpeaking of consulting - when I look back on the last 18 months, I’ve had four major clients that have all been dream projects - despite being wildly different. This is the promise of not specializing down or crafting a single coherent positioning for my consulting work…#1 - Spreadsheet InnovationA decade ago, when I was a young-un I created a little video2 thing with Appsumo and Noah Kagan about how to use Google Docs to write scripts, scrape the web and do things it seamed unreasonable for a spreadsheet to be able to do. But that was the magic and promise of an internet-connected spreadsheet back in 2011.Fast forward to 2021 and the magic and promise of an internet-connected spreadsheet became the thesis for a product R&amp;D sprint with a client. What a dream gig. Working on everything from user research and synthesizing existing academic HCI research to playing producer on a little technical prototype was tons of fun.Last year I worked on some R&amp;D stuff for the New York Times and I really enjoy these projects. Specifically, I think I have a lot to offer when we need both market/brand positioning and we need to sell the idea into the wider organization.I’m going to keep chipping away at these R&amp;D projects until I get the chance to structure and build an R&amp;D team for a client…#2 - Brand Positioning x Content StrategyWhen a large enterprise level client approached me for content strategy I was initially a little skeptical. The project seemed a bit too tactical for my liking. But after the client gave a free license to expand the brief I ended up creating a content strategy that aligned brand positioning, business objectives, customer insights and content strategy (yes, with a little SEO thrown in too).Far too often I see organizations where the brand strategy and the content strategy are misaligned or just completely disconnected. So being able to zoom in and out from the brand positioning to the details of the content strategy meant a very cohesive piece of work. Something that felt like it hung together well as a whole.I think this might have been some of my best work.#3 - Agency TransformationI wrote a piece for the SEO MBA newsletter: How to turn your agency into the “McKinsey of SEO” and then promptly closed a consulting gig to transform a digital agency off the back of it.That gig turned out to be tons of fun - what started with a brief of “help us deliver projects better” turned into a very open ended and ongoing project to drive change all the way through the agency starting with external and positioning, overhauling the sales process and then changing both the contract and delivery model.That project has required wearing lots of different hats and working on all kinds of outputs. The final piece we’re assembling now is a Notion hub of embedded knowledge to help the organization retain these practices and processes after I’m gone.Getting to work on this project end to end so to speak all the way from external positioning to delivery model was very satisfying and validated a lot of my experience working with and coaching agencies. Agencies are complex systems where all the pieces are very closely related and changing one part without also changing another is often a recipe for disaster.Interestingly one special wrinkle that made this project fun to work on was that they had Gong recording all their sales calls AND their consulting calls. So in the age of a pandemic where everything is virtual I was able to follow clients all the way from initial sales call to kickoff and delivery. It was like I was a football coach reviewing game tape. This both allowed me to get up to speed incredibly quickly, but also back up my arguments with real examples, quotes and case studies from client projects.Never underestimate how powerful it is to use real quotes (from users, clients, stakeholders etc) to convince people of an argument.#4 - SEO Investment CaseI talked about this project last year but it spilled over into this year too. Working with a large organization to help them restructure their SEO program all the way from strategy and investment plan through to hiring a VP and working with them to plan the org chart. While on the one hand this was firmly in the SEO space, on the other it involved zero “SEO” and was all about securing budget and buy-in from key stakeholders and then putting it into practice through recruiting.The project was a lot of fun - especially because working with the CEO directly helped sharpen my thinking and my executive skills in new ways. I love working with CEOs who listen carefully and then ask hard questions.Ultimately this was the project that really opened my eyes to how urgent and widespread the skills gap in the SEO industry is. There are plenty of companies trying to hire for senior SEO roles that just can’t find people who are both technically competent AND able to operate as a senior executive.And thus, the SEO MBA was born.The BookAh the book. Between traveling, consulting and the SEO MBA the book hasn’t made a ton of progress this year. That said, I wrote two pieces on Chronos &amp; Kairos that I’m incredibly proud of and I think is some of my best writing:  The Consultant Out of Time. Chronos &amp; Kairos - a framework for just-in-time consulting  The Jigsaw of Independence. Putting together an independent life without falling apartAnd after 3+ years of slowing writing this thing in public I’ve finally figured out the point of the book. I’ve got a tight theme and a coherent idea that’s going to make it come together nicely. I think I’ve got one or two more chapters to write and then it’s into editing, re-writing and publishing.I’m pretty committed to self publishing at this point and I’m 80% confident that I can string together enough code and the Lulu API to create a self published hardcover where every book has a unique generative cover design. Something like this maybe:Last year I was nervous that “finishing” the book would leave me adrift without a coherent frame for my consulting journey. But now, poised to enter 2022 I’m embracing the winds of change. I don’t know yet where next year will take me but I feel some big changes brewing and finishing the book is going to be a meaningful part of the journey.Don’t let me write one more yearly update without having published the book!BloggingBlogging was a big casualty this year. I barely published at all, at least not on my own site. I wrote 15 issues of the SEO MBA though so I’ve been pretty active, just not with blogging.Partly that’s been ok because I’ve had other priorities but in addition I’d really like to figure out some smoother workflows for writing. I’m especially jealous of Simon’s “stream” posts that are shorter and more link-blog-esque. My workflow feels cumbersome for those posts today so I want to try and build a better workflow, probably while still using Jekyll + Github Pages… If anyone has ideas I’m all ears.I’m also due a blog re-design. Not just because the photo on the homepage is almost a decade old but because I want to make this site feel fresh and fun again - I’m bored with the white stark design. I’ve got something 90% designed in Figma, I’ve just got to find time to turn it into HTML….What’s in store for the year ahead? Honestly who knows. I feel like it’s a year of reinvention and change for this indie consultant and I’m excited to see where the winds of change take me.As ever, thank you to everyone who’s supported the journey so far. Much love.            This is a great thread that dissects a viral tweet about consulting and explores where the term “consultant” sits in the cultural discourse. &#8617;              Embarrassing to link to that here? Maybe. &#8617;      "

I guess I’m a creator now?I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who assume that the SEO MBA course was motivated by trying to “get off the treadmill of consulting” and “generate passive income”. And… that’s not it. The dust hasn’t settled yet since I launched the course so it’s too early to tell what the true impact is going to be, but my core motivation for the course was:  Teaching is something I draw deep satisfaction from. I really enjoy it and value it and unfortunately have not had a lot of opportunity to do this being an independent consultant. The SEO MBA is at it’s heart about education. Designing a curriculum, helping shape people’s mental models, creating effective teaching tools. These are all fun and interesting and meaningful!  The most rewarding thing I’ve done in my career was leading a team of consultants at Distilled and watching junior talent become more senior and spread their wings. Supporting people through career growth is extremely rewarding. My aspiration with the SEO MBA is to bend the arc of people’s careers a bit - to help people get pay rises, promotions and new jobs. To feel more confident in their work. I don’t know how many people I’ll reach this deeply or how effective this course will be but that’s my dream.  Honestly from working in SEO and working outside of it, I can feel the skills gap so keenly. The SEO MBA kept calling to me as something that needed to exist in the world. It’s hard to fight that.  Putting together an online course (and a well-read Substack) is a whole new set of skills! Learning about curriculum design, video shooting, lighting! Oh my. It’s fun to scratch some new itches and explore some new skills, even if not super deeply. I’m happy with how the final video content came out, though I can already see how the next course (hmm?!) might be even better.While launch week has been amazing - it’s already clear to me that passive income is anything but. I can see now that if I wanted to, the SEO MBA could be 100% of my income in 2022. But it would require a significant time investment! From where I’m standing now it feels on par with consulting.What’s been unexpected is that impact on consulting. Already a lot of my consulting work this year has been generated through the SEO MBA email! Just positioning myself there and writing that content has generated some interesting work.All in for 2021 I expect the SEO MBA course + consulting clients will account for 2/3 of my overall revenue.That said, I just kicked off a new consulting client this week so I’m not hanging up the gloves just yet :)Four Dream Consulting Gigs - All Very DifferentSpeaking of consulting - when I look back on the last 18 months, I’ve had four major clients that have all been dream projects - despite being wildly different. This is the promise of not specializing down or crafting a single coherent positioning for my consulting work…#1 - Spreadsheet InnovationA decade ago, when I was a young-un I created a little video2 thing with Appsumo and Noah Kagan about how to use Google Docs to write scripts, scrape the web and do things it seamed unreasonable for a spreadsheet to be able to do. But that was the magic and promise of an internet-connected spreadsheet back in 2011.Fast forward to 2021 and the magic and promise of an internet-connected spreadsheet became the thesis for a product R&amp;D sprint with a client. What a dream gig. Working on everything from user research and synthesizing existing academic HCI research to playing producer on a little technical prototype was tons of fun.Last year I worked on some R&amp;D stuff for the New York Times and I really enjoy these projects. Specifically, I think I have a lot to offer when we need both market/brand positioning and we need to sell the idea into the wider organization.I’m going to keep chipping away at these R&amp;D projects until I get the chance to structure and build an R&amp;D team for a client…#2 - Brand Positioning x Content StrategyWhen a large enterprise level client approached me for content strategy I was initially a little skeptical. The project seemed a bit too tactical for my liking. But after the client gave a free license to expand the brief I ended up creating a content strategy that aligned brand positioning, business objectives, customer insights and content strategy (yes, with a little SEO thrown in too).Far too often I see organizations where the brand strategy and the content strategy are misaligned or just completely disconnected. So being able to zoom in and out from the brand positioning to the details of the content strategy meant a very cohesive piece of work. Something that felt like it hung together well as a whole.I think this might have been some of my best work.#3 - Agency TransformationI wrote a piece for the SEO MBA newsletter: How to turn your agency into the “McKinsey of SEO” and then promptly closed a consulting gig to transform a digital agency off the back of it.That gig turned out to be tons of fun - what started with a brief of “help us deliver projects better” turned into a very open ended and ongoing project to drive change all the way through the agency starting with external and positioning, overhauling the sales process and then changing both the contract and delivery model.That project has required wearing lots of different hats and working on all kinds of outputs. The final piece we’re assembling now is a Notion hub of embedded knowledge to help the organization retain these practices and processes after I’m gone.Getting to work on this project end to end so to speak all the way from external positioning to delivery model was very satisfying and validated a lot of my experience working with and coaching agencies. Agencies are complex systems where all the pieces are very closely related and changing one part without also changing another is often a recipe for disaster.Interestingly one special wrinkle that made this project fun to work on was that they had Gong recording all their sales calls AND their consulting calls. So in the age of a pandemic where everything is virtual I was able to follow clients all the way from initial sales call to kickoff and delivery. It was like I was a football coach reviewing game tape. This both allowed me to get up to speed incredibly quickly, but also back up my arguments with real examples, quotes and case studies from client projects.Never underestimate how powerful it is to use real quotes (from users, clients, stakeholders etc) to convince people of an argument.#4 - SEO Investment CaseI talked about this project last year but it spilled over into this year too. Working with a large organization to help them restructure their SEO program all the way from strategy and investment plan through to hiring a VP and working with them to plan the org chart. While on the one hand this was firmly in the SEO space, on the other it involved zero “SEO” and was all about securing budget and buy-in from key stakeholders and then putting it into practice through recruiting.The project was a lot of fun - especially because working with the CEO directly helped sharpen my thinking and my executive skills in new ways. I love working with CEOs who listen carefully and then ask hard questions.Ultimately this was the project that really opened my eyes to how urgent and widespread the skills gap in the SEO industry is. There are plenty of companies trying to hire for senior SEO roles that just can’t find people who are both technically competent AND able to operate as a senior executive.And thus, the SEO MBA was born.The BookAh the book. Between traveling, consulting and the SEO MBA the book hasn’t made a ton of progress this year. That said, I wrote two pieces on Chronos &amp; Kairos that I’m incredibly proud of and I think is some of my best writing:  The Consultant Out of Time. Chronos &amp; Kairos - a framework for just-in-time consulting  The Jigsaw of Independence. Putting together an independent life without falling apartAnd after 3+ years of slowing writing this thing in public I’ve finally figured out the point of the book. I’ve got a tight theme and a coherent idea that’s going to make it come together nicely. I think I’ve got one or two more chapters to write and then it’s into editing, re-writing and publishing.I’m pretty committed to self publishing at this point and I’m 80% confident that I can string together enough code and the Lulu API to create a self published hardcover where every book has a unique generative cover design. Something like this maybe:Last year I was nervous that “finishing” the book would leave me adrift without a coherent frame for my consulting journey. But now, poised to enter 2022 I’m embracing the winds of change. I don’t know yet where next year will take me but I feel some big changes brewing and finishing the book is going to be a meaningful part of the journey.Don’t let me write one more yearly update without having published the book!BloggingBlogging was a big casualty this year. I barely published at all, at least not on my own site. I wrote 15 issues of the SEO MBA though so I’ve been pretty active, just not with blogging.Partly that’s been ok because I’ve had other priorities but in addition I’d really like to figure out some smoother workflows for writing. I’m especially jealous of Simon’s “stream” posts that are shorter and more link-blog-esque. My workflow feels cumbersome for those posts today so I want to try and build a better workflow, probably while still using Jekyll + Github Pages… If anyone has ideas I’m all ears.I’m also due a blog re-design. Not just because the photo on the homepage is almost a decade old but because I want to make this site feel fresh and fun again - I’m bored with the white stark design. I’ve got something 90% designed in Figma, I’ve just got to find time to turn it into HTML….What’s in store for the year ahead? Honestly who knows. I feel like it’s a year of reinvention and change for this indie consultant and I’m excited to see where the winds of change take me.As ever, thank you to everyone who’s supported the journey so far. Much love.            This is a great thread that dissects a viral tweet about consulting and explores where the term “consultant” sits in the cultural discourse. &#8617;              Embarrassing to link to that here? Maybe. &#8617;      "

  "content": "As I write this I’m feeling stretched thin - my background anxiety is elevated and my brain feels slightly scrambled. I only have a modest amount of client work right now but I’m juggling three distinct types of work: consulting, a new venture1 and writing this book.These three activities are very different - not only are they different types of work, but they have different incentive structures (client revenue, self directed revenue and personal project) and different tempos. Trying to balance different types of projects that each have varying tempos and incentives is exceptionally challenging and choosing tradeoffs between them is emotionally taxing. How much consulting money am I willing to give up to be completely focused on writing for a day? This is not a theoretical or a simple question.Unfortunately independent living is full of these emotionally taxing tradeoffs:  Am I willing to turn down this client project in order to take a vacation?  Can I really turn down this client project to work on my side project?  After no clients for two months suddenly I’ve got three clients all kicking off next week!  How do I find uninterrupted time for deep work when managing this client project means I have to be on-call?The way to understand these questions is to better understand the shape of our headspace, to better understand the shape of independent work and to understand our personal energy flows.This requires some introspection and as we saw in part 1: The Consultant Out of Time it requires questioning the underlying assumptions of how we think about time. It turns out that once you give up the 9-5 you literally give up the clock and have to rebuild a time schedule that works for you from first principles.Hopefully this allows us to navigate independent living without burnout.First, why headspace is not a “space” at all:Part 1: Headspace Is a Non-Euclidean SpaceGenerative art based on a space-filling curve for non-Euclidean geometriesOur metaphors matter and “headspace” is a particularly bad one, because headspace is not a “space” that fills up — or rather if it is a space it fills up in some strange ways. In mathematics there’s the notion of Euclidean space which is another name for regular space (forward, backwards, parallel lines never cross - that kind of thing). In Euclidean space, space is uniform and regular. Every 2x2 box is the same size.Non-Euclidean spaces however are strange spaces with their own rules - in some non-Euclidean spaces it’s impossible to have parallel lines. Space can be irregular - a 2x2 box might be bigger or smaller depending on where it is. And it turns out headspace is more like a non-Euclidean space - with strange properties.It’s impossible to segment your headspace into neat boxes. Sometimes small tasks consume large amounts of headspace. Sometimes two kinds of projects can’t exist side by side. These properties mean that understanding your own headspace is a tricky concept.If we think about headspace being a regular space then we might think that we can simply measure how full we are by measuring the amount of work we have committed to: “how many hours am I billing this week? How full is my workload?”. Meaning, we tend to like to categorize our headspace into neat boxes and definitions.But this model maps very poorly to the lived experience of your actual headspace and stress. Instead we need a more nuanced perspective that accounts for a variety of factors. Determining which factors influence your headspace requires a little introspection and self-analysis, but here’s some of the things I’ve identified in my own work:Things that increase stress:  A new client takes significantly more headspace, time and energy than an ongoing client.  Every new client adds incremental stress, independent of the amount of work for them (and this might be exponential! 4 clients is manageable, 5 is very busy and 6 is crazy)  A change in point of contact with a long-term client can be as stressful as a new client.  Not understanding the client’s org chart can consume additional cycles trying to second-guess the organizations behavior and reaction to your work  A client that uses a non-familiar communication channel (e.g. Teams if you’re used to Slack, or Outlook if you’re used to Gmail etc)  Clients with the same schedule (e.g. regular Monday morning meeting) can cause a lot of tension where you are forced into repeated time collisionsThings that decrease stress:  If multiple clients are very similar, that can reduce stress - whether it’s similar type of work or similar working style.  A familiar working relationship reduces headspace because it makes client interactions more predictable and understandable  Long term clients tend to consume far less headspace than new ones  A clear understanding of work that needs to be done  A clear understanding of the client’s org chartSome ExamplesLet’s look at some real examples from my work. Here’s October 2018 vs. January 2020 where each color is a different client and size is dollar amount.Which month felt more stressful?If you simply look at total billing then Oct 2018 is slightly less than Jan 2020. But anyone who’s operated as a freelancer or consultant will obviously recognize that two clients is far less stressful than 4, even if those two clients are larger.If we want a quick and easy method of analyzing headspace you can look at the major factors which are:  The number of clients (more clients = more stress, independent of size)  Is the client new? (new clients = more stress)  How many distinct types of work are there? (more distinct types of work = more stress)These major factors help explain most of the variance in headspace, but it’s not the full picture. Let’s take a look at this period:During the summer of 2018 I had the highest billing months for my consulting business — six clients at once for two consecutive months! This period definitely felt like I was “full,” but I wasn’t over the breaking point. Why? Because if you look closely, there’s some nuance:Three key factors led to being able to cope during this period without burnout:  Three clients (the bottom three in the diagram) were long-term clients — all at least 10 months+. This leads to an ability to quickly context switch into and out of that work.  Two big clients (middle red/blue in the diagram) were for exactly the same kind of work — audience development work for two media companies. This leads to a lot of redundancy and efficiency in headspace, this was a lot of solving one problem and applying it twice.  I was well-rested from a quiet period in the previous four-months.This kind of mental accounting is useful as an exercise in self-reflection, to better understand your own mental headspace and how it relates to what your total capacity might be.We looked at the major factors that influence headspace above, but let’s look at some other factors (mostly ones that are harder to quantify):                             Increase stress if…        Decrease stress if…                            Client communication style        Unpredictable or unfamiliar        Predictable and familiar                    Communication rhythm        Unpredictable or varied tempo / ad-hoc meetings        Predictable, scheduled communication and meetings                    Understanding of the client’s org chart        You don’t understand or don’t have access to the client’s org chart        You understand the flows of power and status in the org chart and the shadow org chart                    Client point of contact        Change in client point of contact        Familiar, comfortable working relationship with the point of contact                    Understanding of the client organization’s goals        Unclear or changing        Clear and stable                    Understanding of the client point of contact personal goals        Unclear or changing        Clear and stable            I’m sure you can adjust and add to this table based on your own experience and personal style too.There’s one aspect of headspace that I want to call out specifically though because it’s so dependent on your individual style - client availability.Headspace Is a Function of Client AvailabilityEvery client comes with very different expectations and demands for your availability. Not just the time commitment, but what is the expected response time? When a client email lands in your inbox how quickly do you feel you need to respond?This is a critical question because it’s going to dictate how much work you can handle at once and your overall stress levels. It’s not just about the client’s communication style and expectations but how compatible your working style is with the client’s.Some independent consultants are just not comfortable being highly available to clients. And if that’s true then you need to design your offering and consulting work around it otherwise you’re constantly going to be fighting clients who want higher availability!I’ve written about this before - specifically about how “executive sparring” (work limited to 1:1 sessions with a senior executive)  has extremely small time demands outside of the sparring session itself, whereas managing a client project launch might require responding to slack pings from multiple teams in real time throughout the week. In general, “doing” work requires you to be much more available and on-call than “thinking” work - with executive sparring having perhaps the best money/availability ratio. From my notes on Sparring as Tenure:  So is sparring just an intellectually stimulating but less-well-paid version of consulting?  No — there are some clear benefits of chasing sparring as consulting.  Firstly, I’m a decade younger than Venkatesh and still able to pull stunts like billing 3 days a week to one client while also billing 3 days a week to another client. Dipping into energy reserves and sprinting on work for sustained periods throughout the year. Much like physical fitness I can already feel my capacity for this declining.  Secondly, “doing” work captures a larger portion of your head space. When you’re managing a marketing org you can’t “take Thursday and Friday offline to write blog posts”. Operational work requires high availability and an “always-on” mentality. Especially if you’re in doing mode for multiple clients at once. It can be incredibly demanding on your time and any side project / writing / teaching / long-term research gets consistently interrupted, paused or put on hold.  In a nutshell, sparring work is long-term stable, well-paid work relative to the amount of headspace and energy required.Different kinds of work will have different demands on the availability of your time.For example, if you’re in the habit of running four-day brand sprint workshops, then you should expect to be deeply immersed for those four days (and likely some days before/after) and almost entirely unavailable for other clients or projects. However, you may well be largely free outside of the workshop — with client demands being minimal.There’s no right or wrong type of work — but you should closely interrogate your own working styles and recognize how stressed it makes you to be on-call with clients. Personally, I have three client email addresses and three client Slack groups, and I don’t mind having a high availability for each of them. But some consultants I know can’t stand that low-key background stress of being available at any time for clients.And be mindful of signing clients for small amounts of money that have high availability expectations.Ok, so now that we have a more nuanced understanding of the shape of our headspace we can start to do things with it.Part 2: Headspace, Pricing and DowntimeUnderstanding the shape of headspace is a mostly intellectual exercise so let’s look at some practical applications - and see how headspace and total capacity relate to the shape of independent work (which is most definitely not stable and predictable!).Pricing in the PainOne of the best non-obvious pieces of pricing advice I was given is that you should always price projects so that you’re happy if they say yes.What does this mean? It means pricing in the drag on your headspace - taking into account the factors above and beyond simply the time commitment, but looking further to the headspace commitment.  Think the client is going to be a nightmare to work with? Charge more.  The organization’s structure and complexity is opaque to you? Charge more.  Slammed with work right now and this will be your 5th client? Charge more.  The work is going to be high-availability? Charge more.Refer back to the ideas above around what causes a client to take up additional headspace and you’ll find a set of factors that you should consider when pricing up a project.It’s OK to put yourself at or over your max capacity if you deliberately choose to, but doing it accidentally or doing it with underpriced work is a huge mistake that leads to burnout. Make sure you’re getting paid for sprinting at max capacity.And speaking of max capacity… what is the shape of independent work? Turns out it’s not at all stable and consistent.Preparing Yourself for the PeaksOne of the defining features of independent work is the variable nature of clients. How much work you have at any point is variable — how much money you’re earning is variable too.Because your client load and income are going to fluctuate, it’s important to consider your total base capacity and your burst capacity.Total base capacity is how much work you can comfortably manage over long periods of time. Understanding this will give you a sense of your baseline income and the sustainability of your consulting model.Burst capacity is how much work you can handle at a sprint for a limited time (think one to three months) at absolute maximum capacity without burning out.While it might seem that total base capacity is more important, in reality most indie consultants spend their months at 50-80% base capacity so the number is not that meaningful - what really impacts and dictates their workload and income is their ability to handle burst capacity.Look again at this chart:The red dotted line here is roughly equal to my max base capacity. Note how I’ve spent a few periods consistently around this limit but most of my work is 50-80% max base capacity.Your natural instinct might be to stop accepting work that goes over your max base capacity. After all, what’s the point of having a max capacity if you’re going to ignore it? But if I’d capped my work there I’d have missed out on a significant chunk of revenue.Adding a ceiling to your client work has a real impact on your revenue - not only do you lose out on in the immediate revenue but almost certainly lose out on the lifetime revenue from that client (most clients aren’t particularly flexible on starting date and if you miss that window you’ll most likely lose the client completely).For example - if you look at the above image where the red line is drawn, in 2018 I would have had 27% less revenue from being unable to take on those projects.This is a common feature of variable systems - one study showed that if you’re investing in the stock market and miss the 5 best days a year you lose 35% of your returns!Independent consulting can feel the same way - highly variable client leads make your revenue highly variable and attempts to “smooth” this revenue are mostly tilting at windmills. Instead you should embrace that your workload (and revenue) is going to fluctuate and prepare best you can for the bursts - increasing your burst capacity (without burnout!) is essential.So if your ability to handle peaks (without burning out!) is directly related to your earning potential, how do you get better at dealing with peaks?This requires operating outside of traditional time expectations and rejecting deliverables as we saw in the last chapter. But it also requires learning the skill of efficient context switching.Learning the Skill of Context SwitchingJust like transaction costs are at the heart of economics for firms, context switching costs are at the heart of indie consulting economics. Learning good context switching, and splicing time from one client into another client, is generally good practice and will serve you well — but the skill becomes essential during peak periods.Context switching is basically the tax you pay for switching between one client and another. People’s initial idea about context switching is you need to be able to build good onramps - ways to “get up to speed quickly” but actually the secret is building good off ramps - ways to save your current position in a task/project/client and freeze it so you can come back to it later.For Venkatesh - note taking is a key activity for context switching between clients:Once I started my note-taking, all that changed. Meeting sequences began to feel like steady forward progress with very little&nbsp;backlash. Context-switching&nbsp;between&nbsp;clients got much more pleasant (particularly important on days when you have back-to-back meetings with entirely different clients, which I try to avoid, but sometimes happens).Clients often don’t recognize the value of the notes initially. Superficially, it seems like make-work. But as the relationship develops, they realize that it’s the core of why sparring with an external consultant is valuable at all. Even if you never refer back to the notes, and your client never does either, the very fact of writing them up lends a smooth continuity to the conversation track, and a sense of accumulating insight and value. It is at the heart of the deliberate practice element in executive sparring.Free Cogs artofgig.comIn my own work  I find a few things provide the ability to “save state” and perform rapid context switching:  Keeping personal notes on every meeting - these are distinct from meeting minutes. Personal notes preserve context about things like emotion and include my own commentary on things I noticed or observations about power and status, unexpected actions etc.  Writing down a clear north star metric for every engagement that maps to the highest level ambition of the client (the key is to actually write this down, not just try and remember it!)  Communication by default - so that whatever I’m working on is shared with the client and not a surprise (so we can both get up to speed fast)  Keeping a mini “client control center” where I meticulously keep handy all of the links to the key documents, project management login URL etc.Just-in-Time DowntimeIf preparing yourself for the peaks is important, it’s just as important to prepare yourself for the troughs. Those slow times can be paralyzing and demoralizing for independent workers.The best advice I got when I started out consulting (thanks Dave!) was to make the most of your downtime. When you have free time, make sure you use it to recharge and rest. For me this is biking and kung-fu (and blogging!). And it’s important to give yourself permission to take downtime and recharge “on the clock” during the work week.Taking a bike ride at 11am on a Tuesday might feel like slacking off but it’s actually a crucial part of operating as an independent consultant. Because when 3 clients all sign at once and the work peak arrives there’s no smoothing function and there’s no team to back you up - you just have to buckle up and dive in.During these peaks you’re likely going to be working long hours, nights and weekends and letting client demands walk all over your personal time. If we’re ok with client work encroaching on our downtime, shouldn’t we be comfortable letting our downtime encroach on our working time?This isn’t theoretical. If we look again at my all-time peak, the only way I handled it without burning out was the rest and downtime I’d opportunistically taken for myself the previous months:This advice is easier said than done of course - especially when you’re newly starting out. How do you have confidence in your system to be able to take breaks before you’re reliably generating income?This is a tough chicken/egg problem to crack - my best advice is to surround yourself with other independent workers to be able to observe their behavior. Having a desk at a coworking space full of independents in year 2-3 of my indie journey allowed me to absorb the working styles of independents. It’s all over the place, evenings, weekends, late starts, early starts, weeks without coming into the office. All kinds of behavior - but most crucially everyone takes breaks as needed, not when the breaks are scheduled.Part 3: The Energy MatrixOK great, we solved the headspace equation and completed the jigsaw of independence! Yes, well, actually no not quite.There’s another component — your motivation and your energy. Not only how busy you are but how satisfied you are. This is more complicated. You can be “at capacity” but feeling on top of the world, or you can be only partially full with work and feeling despondent and without motivation.While working with Sunil, my executive coach a few years back, he opened my eyes to this energy matrix - a diagnostic tool to understand where satisfaction comes from. It’s incredibly simple and adaptable to your needs, but in essence it works like this:  Identify a set of “things that are important” — these are types of activity that you find important and/or provide you with energy.  Score every major project with a score (I use -1 to +3 but it’s not an exact science).  Add up the rows to find out which projects are giving you the most energy.  Add up the columns to find gaps in your satisfaction.Here’s a real example from that max capacity period before, when I had six clients at once:For me, I identified eight core things that provide me value:  Leading others means aligning teams, providing direction and generally playing a leadership role.  Learning and being challenged means pushing myself into new situations, learning new things.  Giving energy means motivating and encouraging others, building others up.  Face to face means feeling that adrenaline rush of meetings, workshops, and presentations live.  Creative means having creative outlets — from mocking up landing pages in Figma to outlining a creative strategy in Slides.  Authoring means publishing writing to the internet.  Connecting the dots means building my network and making good connections between people.  $$$ means paying the bills and sustaining my family.Identifying these is not trivial, but the good news is you can update them easily!Here’s the above matrix in a spreadsheet for you to copy (but remember to identify your own values!)It’s crucial here to look at the full spectrum of projects, everything that fits inside your “independent identity” container. Not just the client work but all the side projects, blogging, writing etc. I called this post the “Jigsaw of Independence” because unlike in full time work you get to choose the makeup of projects.As an independent worker you can assemble a patchwork quilt of client work and personal projects that sum up to a satisfying workload. But this work needs to be intentional and deliberate otherwise you’ll end up at the whims of client work. Instead you need to strategically assemble a patchwork of projects that you can spin up/down just in time, as needed, to scratch your itches and fill up the various buckets.In fact this is part of the promise of indie consulting - instead of a monolithic single commitment that needs to fulfill all of your needs you can add and subtract commitments to balance, and evolve, your needs as you go. And you can balance revenue generating projects with non revenue generating projects just fine!This is all part of the never ending process to define your own identity as an indie consultant now that you’re on your own and no one is telling you who you are anymore…Part 4: Grinding Gears between Chronos &amp; Kairos livingSo far the key to a sustainable independent lifestyle is operating outside of traditional time scales - operating on Kairos time, not Chronos time. We do this by embracing just in time work, dealing with burst capacity and grabbing rest with just in time downtime.Some things don’t change though - we still need the same fundamental things as full time workers: identity, vacations, financial security, satisfying work. The key difference is that for full-time workers you re-evaluate these things infrequently - typically when you move from one role to another.But indie consultants - kairos workers - are able to re-evaluate these things continually with much more flexibility and iteration. This can be a blessing and a curse as we’ll see…Always-on career changeLet’s take a look at the difference between a full-time worker and an indie consultant:                             Full-time worker “Discrete step changes”        Indie consultant “Always-on and self-directed”                            Identity        Defined by your job title — changes when you get a new job.        Self-defined, renewed and pivoted as often as you like.                    Income &amp; pay raises        Income fixed by job. Pay review cycle is typically yearly.        Monthly/quarterly/yearly — how you track it is up to you and highly variable, depending on client load and billable rates. Income can go up and down!                    Vacations and time off        A few weeks a year, booked in advance.        Time off can happen when client work gets slow, sometimes on a moment’s notice.                    Job hunting        When you’re laid off or actively looking for a new job.        Constantly seeking new clients and connections.                    Job satisfaction        Depends on step changes (new boss, new team, new job).        Always fluctuating, dependent on a mix of clients and projects.                    Learning &amp; development        Formalized skills ladder, often with conference budget and courses available so long as you stay in your lane.        Self directed learning with plenty of room for experimentation. Everything paid for out of pocket.            Understanding and embracing this transition — from discrete step changes to an always-on mindset — can be difficult. You have to unlearn ways of operating in your personal and professional life that are deeply ingrained. You need to rewire your personal operating system.And, further — there’s no boss to rail against except yourself. As Venkatesh wrote in the Art of Gig2:The problem is, as a free agent, you are your own boss, and you’re likely a bad boss, unable to relax, and driven by fretful anxiety about lining up the next gig. That would be bad enough, except that you’re also an&nbsp;omniscient&nbsp;bad boss. You know all your own tricks, and nothing is hidden from you. You can’t sneak away from yourself.Sneaking Away from Yourself https://studio.ribbonfarm.comThe key point here is that there’s less stability and less commitment as an indie consultant. Change is always available - which means your personal development is “always on” and will change in many small steps vs big discrete jumps. Just like we should adopt a kairos mindset to consulting work we should adopt a kairos mindset to personal development. At the same time however, because everything happens in increments, there’s very rarely any external validation that “you’ve made it” in the same way that a promotion or new job might provide this sense of achievement.I was an indie consultant on day 1 when I quit my job with zero clients and income and I’m an indie consultant today almost 7 years in with over a million dollars of income from consulting. The path from one to the other has been a meandering adventure with no clear breaks or jumps…Let’s illustrate this with an imaginary example. Let’s say I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to do UX design consulting work. I can change my website, update my “hire me” page, change up my creds deck and write a blog post or two about UX design. The same day, I’ve already pivoted my identity. But at the same time all I’ve done is update things directly within my control. The question is how much do I buy my own BS? How much do I feel like a UX designer vs just feeling like a fraud?The point here is not that one way or the other is better (though, I have some thoughts) but rather there’s a tradeoff in both directions and you need to understand that being indie is fundamentally, structurally different from being a full time worker. Not just because of the freedom, but because of the lack of support, structure and validation.The inner game of consulting is all about creating mental models for thinking about time, energy and headspace. You need to learn how to understand and manage your own psychology if you’re going to survive.Grinding Gears between Chronos and KairosOne danger for independent consultants — trying to match your just-in-time living with chronos workers. I’m lucky enough to live in a kairos household; my partner runs her own business and makes picture books, so we’re not operating on chronos time.But trying to line up kairos and chronos living can be tough.Taking time off is a great example of where gears grind. The mental model of work/rest from chronos living doesn’t translate well to kairos timeHere’s a quote from a fellow independent consultant that articulates some of the angst and psychological gear grinding when chronos and kairos meet:  I am constantly hearing people say to me - “you work too much. You need to slow down. Take a break. Shouldn’t you be working less as a consultant? Isn’t that thepoint?”  I just about worked from Jan straight through summer, - 7 days always on - even in Cannes, even in pretty beachside places.. and phew, summer is always full on as a consultant. And this year, I paid a hefty price of stress on my body and thus am dealing with it. So now am taking 4 weeks off (as best I can which means just one client vs many - I am, me after all) in the fall. The response is, “must be nice. Wow. Who gets to do that?!”  If I change the dialogue to, “I certainly feel I earned some time off”… I get the same response. “Wow, must be nice to not have to work all the time. Consulting must be great business!”  I’ve really struggled with not feeling frustrated with these comments and taking them personally. Taking a set bulk of time off doesn’t mean I work less. Having flexibility to go to things during the day also doesn’t mean I work less than others - it’s a different cadence.  When we work on our own, or own a small business - we get amazing flexibility. But we also don’t have fixed incomes and ‘PTO.” PTO - ha! On your own, you have to use different muscle and motivation to often work doubly hard and smarter. Over the years, I’ve felt that sometimes the guilt of not working, is so intense it’s hard to actually commit to a break… Someone a few weeks ago told me, as solo entrepreneurs - you are always future-minded, and the present can be a challenge sometimes to simply put pencils down and live in it. That resonated with me. Sometimes I think I’m getting better at it. Sometimes it’s two steps back.  But hopefully, finding a way to let go of that judgement I’ve felt when people say - wow must be nice.. and instead just say, YUP IT ISAmen to this. The independent life is full of new kinds of tradeoffs, and this can cause a lot of friction when Chronos and Kairos meet. We can return to that chart above to better understand where gears can grind:                             Full-time worker “Discrete step changes”        Grinding Gears        Indie consultant “Always-on and self directed”                            Identity        Defined by your job title — changes when you get a new job.        “You’re always launching something!” Hard to keep a stable idea of what you do, launching ideas faster than chronos is comfortable.        Self-defined, renewed and pivoted as often as you like.                    Income &amp; pay raises        Income fixed by job. Pay review cycle is typically yearly.        Can you pay the bills? Stability?        Monthly/quarterly/yearly — how you track it is up to you and highly variable, depending on client load and billable rates.                    Vacations and time off        A few weeks a year, booked in advance.        We can’t just go to Hawaii next week! My work needs to know if we can book those two weeks in the summer.        Time off can happen when client work gets slow, sometimes on a moment’s notice.                    Job hunting        When you’re laid off or actively looking for a new job        How do I describe what you do? You’re always changing how you describe yourself and your work.        Constantly seeking new clients and connections.                    Job satisfaction        Depends on step changes (new boss, new job).        Highly variable job satisfaction.        Always fluctuating, dependent on evergreen satisfaction.                    Learning &amp; development        Formalized skills ladder, often with conference budget and courses available so long as you stay in your lane.        Self directed learning with plenty of room for experimentation. Everything paid for out of pocket.                     Part of the problem here is that it’s easy to describe the differences between full time (chronos) work and indie (kairos) work - but you don’t really internalize and understand the differences until you live them. And many of these changes happen to deep rooted concepts like financial stability, identity and our sense of self worth.Because the indie path removes all sense of validation, credentialing and identity you might have to take some things seriously even if they’re not client work. Assembling and recreating all the pieces of a full-time career is non trivial and requires a patchwork assemblage of projects - the jigsaw of independence.Conclusion: the only way out is inThe key insight underpinning everything here is that:  As an independent worker your relationship to time, stress, money and rest all need to re-negotiated. To create a sustainable independent path you need to create new routines, new ways of working and new ways of skiving off.  Navigating these changes requires a deep introspection and self-analysis to notice how you feel when you’re busy, to notice what kinds of work light you up, to notice how you feel when you’ve got no work.It’s not that the only way out is through, but rather the only way out is in(side). You need to learn to be self aware in a continual way - to be always keeping track of your stress, motivations, incentives and energy.Walking the path of an indie consultant you will learn to live an alternative path outside of all kinds of “normal” structures - this can be disorienting and demoralizing but ultimately it puts you in control of your own time, energy and identity in a way that full-time work can’t.I remember clearly in the early days of consulting — I met someone I respected who managed a ton of different projects at once — it was noon outside Whole Foods. He had his feet up on a bench, sitting in the sunshine and eating some sushi.I asked him, “How do you do it? You do so much and you’re sitting here eating sushi!” He said, “It’s simple; you can do it too. The sushi is right inside and it’s only $10.”Your mindset and your energy dictate your capacity far more than actual time — Chronos time. Learn to embrace kairos time and just-in-time living to build a more sustainable independent practice and better understand your own headspace.

  "content": "As I write this I’m feeling stretched thin - my background anxiety is elevated and my brain feels slightly scrambled. I only have a modest amount of client work right now but I’m juggling three distinct types of work: consulting, a new venture1 and writing this book.These three activities are very different - not only are they different types of work, but they have different incentive structures (client revenue, self directed revenue and personal project) and different tempos. Trying to balance different types of projects that each have varying tempos and incentives is exceptionally challenging and choosing tradeoffs between them is emotionally taxing. How much consulting money am I willing to give up to be completely focused on writing for a day? This is not a theoretical or a simple question.Unfortunately independent living is full of these emotionally taxing tradeoffs:  Am I willing to turn down this client project in order to take a vacation?  Can I really turn down this client project to work on my side project?  After no clients for two months suddenly I’ve got three clients all kicking off next week!  How do I find uninterrupted time for deep work when managing this client project means I have to be on-call?The way to understand these questions is to better understand the shape of our headspace, to better understand the shape of independent work and to understand our personal energy flows.This requires some introspection and as we saw in part 1: The Consultant Out of Time it requires questioning the underlying assumptions of how we think about time. It turns out that once you give up the 9-5 you literally give up the clock and have to rebuild a time schedule that works for you from first principles.Hopefully this allows us to navigate independent living without burnout.First, why headspace is not a “space” at all:Part 1: Headspace Is a Non-Euclidean SpaceGenerative art based on a space-filling curve for non-Euclidean geometriesOur metaphors matter and “headspace” is a particularly bad one, because headspace is not a “space” that fills up — or rather if it is a space it fills up in some strange ways. In mathematics there’s the notion of Euclidean space which is another name for regular space (forward, backwards, parallel lines never cross - that kind of thing). In Euclidean space, space is uniform and regular. Every 2x2 box is the same size.Non-Euclidean spaces however are strange spaces with their own rules - in some non-Euclidean spaces it’s impossible to have parallel lines. Space can be irregular - a 2x2 box might be bigger or smaller depending on where it is. And it turns out headspace is more like a non-Euclidean space - with strange properties.It’s impossible to segment your headspace into neat boxes. Sometimes small tasks consume large amounts of headspace. Sometimes two kinds of projects can’t exist side by side. These properties mean that understanding your own headspace is a tricky concept.If we think about headspace being a regular space then we might think that we can simply measure how full we are by measuring the amount of work we have committed to: “how many hours am I billing this week? How full is my workload?”. Meaning, we tend to like to categorize our headspace into neat boxes and definitions.But this model maps very poorly to the lived experience of your actual headspace and stress. Instead we need a more nuanced perspective that accounts for a variety of factors. Determining which factors influence your headspace requires a little introspection and self-analysis, but here’s some of the things I’ve identified in my own work:Things that increase stress:  A new client takes significantly more headspace, time and energy than an ongoing client.  Every new client adds incremental stress, independent of the amount of work for them (and this might be exponential! 4 clients is manageable, 5 is very busy and 6 is crazy)  A change in point of contact with a long-term client can be as stressful as a new client.  Not understanding the client’s org chart can consume additional cycles trying to second-guess the organizations behavior and reaction to your work  A client that uses a non-familiar communication channel (e.g. Teams if you’re used to Slack, or Outlook if you’re used to Gmail etc)  Clients with the same schedule (e.g. regular Monday morning meeting) can cause a lot of tension where you are forced into repeated time collisionsThings that decrease stress:  If multiple clients are very similar, that can reduce stress - whether it’s similar type of work or similar working style.  A familiar working relationship reduces headspace because it makes client interactions more predictable and understandable  Long term clients tend to consume far less headspace than new ones  A clear understanding of work that needs to be done  A clear understanding of the client’s org chartSome ExamplesLet’s look at some real examples from my work. Here’s October 2018 vs. January 2020 where each color is a different client and size is dollar amount.Which month felt more stressful?If you simply look at total billing then Oct 2018 is slightly less than Jan 2020. But anyone who’s operated as a freelancer or consultant will obviously recognize that two clients is far less stressful than 4, even if those two clients are larger.If we want a quick and easy method of analyzing headspace you can look at the major factors which are:  The number of clients (more clients = more stress, independent of size)  Is the client new? (new clients = more stress)  How many distinct types of work are there? (more distinct types of work = more stress)These major factors help explain most of the variance in headspace, but it’s not the full picture. Let’s take a look at this period:During the summer of 2018 I had the highest billing months for my consulting business — six clients at once for two consecutive months! This period definitely felt like I was “full,” but I wasn’t over the breaking point. Why? Because if you look closely, there’s some nuance:Three key factors led to being able to cope during this period without burnout:  Three clients (the bottom three in the diagram) were long-term clients — all at least 10 months+. This leads to an ability to quickly context switch into and out of that work.  Two big clients (middle red/blue in the diagram) were for exactly the same kind of work — audience development work for two media companies. This leads to a lot of redundancy and efficiency in headspace, this was a lot of solving one problem and applying it twice.  I was well-rested from a quiet period in the previous four-months.This kind of mental accounting is useful as an exercise in self-reflection, to better understand your own mental headspace and how it relates to what your total capacity might be.We looked at the major factors that influence headspace above, but let’s look at some other factors (mostly ones that are harder to quantify):                             Increase stress if…        Decrease stress if…                            Client communication style        Unpredictable or unfamiliar        Predictable and familiar                    Communication rhythm        Unpredictable or varied tempo / ad-hoc meetings        Predictable, scheduled communication and meetings                    Understanding of the client’s org chart        You don’t understand or don’t have access to the client’s org chart        You understand the flows of power and status in the org chart and the shadow org chart                    Client point of contact        Change in client point of contact        Familiar, comfortable working relationship with the point of contact                    Understanding of the client organization’s goals        Unclear or changing        Clear and stable                    Understanding of the client point of contact personal goals        Unclear or changing        Clear and stable            I’m sure you can adjust and add to this table based on your own experience and personal style too.There’s one aspect of headspace that I want to call out specifically though because it’s so dependent on your individual style - client availability.Headspace Is a Function of Client AvailabilityEvery client comes with very different expectations and demands for your availability. Not just the time commitment, but what is the expected response time? When a client email lands in your inbox how quickly do you feel you need to respond?This is a critical question because it’s going to dictate how much work you can handle at once and your overall stress levels. It’s not just about the client’s communication style and expectations but how compatible your working style is with the client’s.Some independent consultants are just not comfortable being highly available to clients. And if that’s true then you need to design your offering and consulting work around it otherwise you’re constantly going to be fighting clients who want higher availability!I’ve written about this before - specifically about how “executive sparring” (work limited to 1:1 sessions with a senior executive)  has extremely small time demands outside of the sparring session itself, whereas managing a client project launch might require responding to slack pings from multiple teams in real time throughout the week. In general, “doing” work requires you to be much more available and on-call than “thinking” work - with executive sparring having perhaps the best money/availability ratio. From my notes on Sparring as Tenure:  So is sparring just an intellectually stimulating but less-well-paid version of consulting?  No — there are some clear benefits of chasing sparring as consulting.  Firstly, I’m a decade younger than Venkatesh and still able to pull stunts like billing 3 days a week to one client while also billing 3 days a week to another client. Dipping into energy reserves and sprinting on work for sustained periods throughout the year. Much like physical fitness I can already feel my capacity for this declining.  Secondly, “doing” work captures a larger portion of your head space. When you’re managing a marketing org you can’t “take Thursday and Friday offline to write blog posts”. Operational work requires high availability and an “always-on” mentality. Especially if you’re in doing mode for multiple clients at once. It can be incredibly demanding on your time and any side project / writing / teaching / long-term research gets consistently interrupted, paused or put on hold.  In a nutshell, sparring work is long-term stable, well-paid work relative to the amount of headspace and energy required.Different kinds of work will have different demands on the availability of your time.For example, if you’re in the habit of running four-day brand sprint workshops, then you should expect to be deeply immersed for those four days (and likely some days before/after) and almost entirely unavailable for other clients or projects. However, you may well be largely free outside of the workshop — with client demands being minimal.There’s no right or wrong type of work — but you should closely interrogate your own working styles and recognize how stressed it makes you to be on-call with clients. Personally, I have three client email addresses and three client Slack groups, and I don’t mind having a high availability for each of them. But some consultants I know can’t stand that low-key background stress of being available at any time for clients.And be mindful of signing clients for small amounts of money that have high availability expectations.Ok, so now that we have a more nuanced understanding of the shape of our headspace we can start to do things with it.Part 2: Headspace, Pricing and DowntimeUnderstanding the shape of headspace is a mostly intellectual exercise so let’s look at some practical applications - and see how headspace and total capacity relate to the shape of independent work (which is most definitely not stable and predictable!).Pricing in the PainOne of the best non-obvious pieces of pricing advice I was given is that you should always price projects so that you’re happy if they say yes.What does this mean? It means pricing in the drag on your headspace - taking into account the factors above and beyond simply the time commitment, but looking further to the headspace commitment.  Think the client is going to be a nightmare to work with? Charge more.  The organization’s structure and complexity is opaque to you? Charge more.  Slammed with work right now and this will be your 5th client? Charge more.  The work is going to be high-availability? Charge more.Refer back to the ideas above around what causes a client to take up additional headspace and you’ll find a set of factors that you should consider when pricing up a project.It’s OK to put yourself at or over your max capacity if you deliberately choose to, but doing it accidentally or doing it with underpriced work is a huge mistake that leads to burnout. Make sure you’re getting paid for sprinting at max capacity.And speaking of max capacity… what is the shape of independent work? Turns out it’s not at all stable and consistent.Preparing Yourself for the PeaksOne of the defining features of independent work is the variable nature of clients. How much work you have at any point is variable — how much money you’re earning is variable too.Because your client load and income are going to fluctuate, it’s important to consider your total base capacity and your burst capacity.Total base capacity is how much work you can comfortably manage over long periods of time. Understanding this will give you a sense of your baseline income and the sustainability of your consulting model.Burst capacity is how much work you can handle at a sprint for a limited time (think one to three months) at absolute maximum capacity without burning out.While it might seem that total base capacity is more important, in reality most indie consultants spend their months at 50-80% base capacity so the number is not that meaningful - what really impacts and dictates their workload and income is their ability to handle burst capacity.Look again at this chart:The red dotted line here is roughly equal to my max base capacity. Note how I’ve spent a few periods consistently around this limit but most of my work is 50-80% max base capacity.Your natural instinct might be to stop accepting work that goes over your max base capacity. After all, what’s the point of having a max capacity if you’re going to ignore it? But if I’d capped my work there I’d have missed out on a significant chunk of revenue.Adding a ceiling to your client work has a real impact on your revenue - not only do you lose out on in the immediate revenue but almost certainly lose out on the lifetime revenue from that client (most clients aren’t particularly flexible on starting date and if you miss that window you’ll most likely lose the client completely).For example - if you look at the above image where the red line is drawn, in 2018 I would have had 27% less revenue from being unable to take on those projects.This is a common feature of variable systems - one study showed that if you’re investing in the stock market and miss the 5 best days a year you lose 35% of your returns!Independent consulting can feel the same way - highly variable client leads make your revenue highly variable and attempts to “smooth” this revenue are mostly tilting at windmills. Instead you should embrace that your workload (and revenue) is going to fluctuate and prepare best you can for the bursts - increasing your burst capacity (without burnout!) is essential.So if your ability to handle peaks (without burning out!) is directly related to your earning potential, how do you get better at dealing with peaks?This requires operating outside of traditional time expectations and rejecting deliverables as we saw in the last chapter. But it also requires learning the skill of efficient context switching.Learning the Skill of Context SwitchingJust like transaction costs are at the heart of economics for firms, context switching costs are at the heart of indie consulting economics. Learning good context switching, and splicing time from one client into another client, is generally good practice and will serve you well — but the skill becomes essential during peak periods.Context switching is basically the tax you pay for switching between one client and another. People’s initial idea about context switching is you need to be able to build good onramps - ways to “get up to speed quickly” but actually the secret is building good off ramps - ways to save your current position in a task/project/client and freeze it so you can come back to it later.For Venkatesh - note taking is a key activity for context switching between clients:Once I started my note-taking, all that changed. Meeting sequences began to feel like steady forward progress with very little&nbsp;backlash. Context-switching&nbsp;between&nbsp;clients got much more pleasant (particularly important on days when you have back-to-back meetings with entirely different clients, which I try to avoid, but sometimes happens).Clients often don’t recognize the value of the notes initially. Superficially, it seems like make-work. But as the relationship develops, they realize that it’s the core of why sparring with an external consultant is valuable at all. Even if you never refer back to the notes, and your client never does either, the very fact of writing them up lends a smooth continuity to the conversation track, and a sense of accumulating insight and value. It is at the heart of the deliberate practice element in executive sparring.Free Cogs artofgig.comIn my own work  I find a few things provide the ability to “save state” and perform rapid context switching:  Keeping personal notes on every meeting - these are distinct from meeting minutes. Personal notes preserve context about things like emotion and include my own commentary on things I noticed or observations about power and status, unexpected actions etc.  Writing down a clear north star metric for every engagement that maps to the highest level ambition of the client (the key is to actually write this down, not just try and remember it!)  Communication by default - so that whatever I’m working on is shared with the client and not a surprise (so we can both get up to speed fast)  Keeping a mini “client control center” where I meticulously keep handy all of the links to the key documents, project management login URL etc.Just-in-Time DowntimeIf preparing yourself for the peaks is important, it’s just as important to prepare yourself for the troughs. Those slow times can be paralyzing and demoralizing for independent workers.The best advice I got when I started out consulting (thanks Dave!) was to make the most of your downtime. When you have free time, make sure you use it to recharge and rest. For me this is biking and kung-fu (and blogging!). And it’s important to give yourself permission to take downtime and recharge “on the clock” during the work week.Taking a bike ride at 11am on a Tuesday might feel like slacking off but it’s actually a crucial part of operating as an independent consultant. Because when 3 clients all sign at once and the work peak arrives there’s no smoothing function and there’s no team to back you up - you just have to buckle up and dive in.During these peaks you’re likely going to be working long hours, nights and weekends and letting client demands walk all over your personal time. If we’re ok with client work encroaching on our downtime, shouldn’t we be comfortable letting our downtime encroach on our working time?This isn’t theoretical. If we look again at my all-time peak, the only way I handled it without burning out was the rest and downtime I’d opportunistically taken for myself the previous months:This advice is easier said than done of course - especially when you’re newly starting out. How do you have confidence in your system to be able to take breaks before you’re reliably generating income?This is a tough chicken/egg problem to crack - my best advice is to surround yourself with other independent workers to be able to observe their behavior. Having a desk at a coworking space full of independents in year 2-3 of my indie journey allowed me to absorb the working styles of independents. It’s all over the place, evenings, weekends, late starts, early starts, weeks without coming into the office. All kinds of behavior - but most crucially everyone takes breaks as needed, not when the breaks are scheduled.Part 3: The Energy MatrixOK great, we solved the headspace equation and completed the jigsaw of independence! Yes, well, actually no not quite.There’s another component — your motivation and your energy. Not only how busy you are but how satisfied you are. This is more complicated. You can be “at capacity” but feeling on top of the world, or you can be only partially full with work and feeling despondent and without motivation.While working with Sunil, my executive coach a few years back, he opened my eyes to this energy matrix - a diagnostic tool to understand where satisfaction comes from. It’s incredibly simple and adaptable to your needs, but in essence it works like this:  Identify a set of “things that are important” — these are types of activity that you find important and/or provide you with energy.  Score every major project with a score (I use -1 to +3 but it’s not an exact science).  Add up the rows to find out which projects are giving you the most energy.  Add up the columns to find gaps in your satisfaction.Here’s a real example from that max capacity period before, when I had six clients at once:For me, I identified eight core things that provide me value:  Leading others means aligning teams, providing direction and generally playing a leadership role.  Learning and being challenged means pushing myself into new situations, learning new things.  Giving energy means motivating and encouraging others, building others up.  Face to face means feeling that adrenaline rush of meetings, workshops, and presentations live.  Creative means having creative outlets — from mocking up landing pages in Figma to outlining a creative strategy in Slides.  Authoring means publishing writing to the internet.  Connecting the dots means building my network and making good connections between people.  $$$ means paying the bills and sustaining my family.Identifying these is not trivial, but the good news is you can update them easily!Here’s the above matrix in a spreadsheet for you to copy (but remember to identify your own values!)It’s crucial here to look at the full spectrum of projects, everything that fits inside your “independent identity” container. Not just the client work but all the side projects, blogging, writing etc. I called this post the “Jigsaw of Independence” because unlike in full time work you get to choose the makeup of projects.As an independent worker you can assemble a patchwork quilt of client work and personal projects that sum up to a satisfying workload. But this work needs to be intentional and deliberate otherwise you’ll end up at the whims of client work. Instead you need to strategically assemble a patchwork of projects that you can spin up/down just in time, as needed, to scratch your itches and fill up the various buckets.In fact this is part of the promise of indie consulting - instead of a monolithic single commitment that needs to fulfill all of your needs you can add and subtract commitments to balance, and evolve, your needs as you go. And you can balance revenue generating projects with non revenue generating projects just fine!This is all part of the never ending process to define your own identity as an indie consultant now that you’re on your own and no one is telling you who you are anymore…Part 4: Grinding Gears between Chronos &amp; Kairos livingSo far the key to a sustainable independent lifestyle is operating outside of traditional time scales - operating on Kairos time, not Chronos time. We do this by embracing just in time work, dealing with burst capacity and grabbing rest with just in time downtime.Some things don’t change though - we still need the same fundamental things as full time workers: identity, vacations, financial security, satisfying work. The key difference is that for full-time workers you re-evaluate these things infrequently - typically when you move from one role to another.But indie consultants - kairos workers - are able to re-evaluate these things continually with much more flexibility and iteration. This can be a blessing and a curse as we’ll see…Always-on career changeLet’s take a look at the difference between a full-time worker and an indie consultant:                             Full-time worker “Discrete step changes”        Indie consultant “Always-on and self-directed”                            Identity        Defined by your job title — changes when you get a new job.        Self-defined, renewed and pivoted as often as you like.                    Income &amp; pay raises        Income fixed by job. Pay review cycle is typically yearly.        Monthly/quarterly/yearly — how you track it is up to you and highly variable, depending on client load and billable rates. Income can go up and down!                    Vacations and time off        A few weeks a year, booked in advance.        Time off can happen when client work gets slow, sometimes on a moment’s notice.                    Job hunting        When you’re laid off or actively looking for a new job.        Constantly seeking new clients and connections.                    Job satisfaction        Depends on step changes (new boss, new team, new job).        Always fluctuating, dependent on a mix of clients and projects.                    Learning &amp; development        Formalized skills ladder, often with conference budget and courses available so long as you stay in your lane.        Self directed learning with plenty of room for experimentation. Everything paid for out of pocket.            Understanding and embracing this transition — from discrete step changes to an always-on mindset — can be difficult. You have to unlearn ways of operating in your personal and professional life that are deeply ingrained. You need to rewire your personal operating system.And, further — there’s no boss to rail against except yourself. As Venkatesh wrote in the Art of Gig2:The problem is, as a free agent, you are your own boss, and you’re likely a bad boss, unable to relax, and driven by fretful anxiety about lining up the next gig. That would be bad enough, except that you’re also an&nbsp;omniscient&nbsp;bad boss. You know all your own tricks, and nothing is hidden from you. You can’t sneak away from yourself.Sneaking Away from Yourself https://studio.ribbonfarm.comThe key point here is that there’s less stability and less commitment as an indie consultant. Change is always available - which means your personal development is “always on” and will change in many small steps vs big discrete jumps. Just like we should adopt a kairos mindset to consulting work we should adopt a kairos mindset to personal development. At the same time however, because everything happens in increments, there’s very rarely any external validation that “you’ve made it” in the same way that a promotion or new job might provide this sense of achievement.I was an indie consultant on day 1 when I quit my job with zero clients and income and I’m an indie consultant today almost 7 years in with over a million dollars of income from consulting. The path from one to the other has been a meandering adventure with no clear breaks or jumps…Let’s illustrate this with an imaginary example. Let’s say I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to do UX design consulting work. I can change my website, update my “hire me” page, change up my creds deck and write a blog post or two about UX design. The same day, I’ve already pivoted my identity. But at the same time all I’ve done is update things directly within my control. The question is how much do I buy my own BS? How much do I feel like a UX designer vs just feeling like a fraud?The point here is not that one way or the other is better (though, I have some thoughts) but rather there’s a tradeoff in both directions and you need to understand that being indie is fundamentally, structurally different from being a full time worker. Not just because of the freedom, but because of the lack of support, structure and validation.The inner game of consulting is all about creating mental models for thinking about time, energy and headspace. You need to learn how to understand and manage your own psychology if you’re going to survive.Grinding Gears between Chronos and KairosOne danger for independent consultants — trying to match your just-in-time living with chronos workers. I’m lucky enough to live in a kairos household; my partner runs her own business and makes picture books, so we’re not operating on chronos time.But trying to line up kairos and chronos living can be tough.Taking time off is a great example of where gears grind. The mental model of work/rest from chronos living doesn’t translate well to kairos timeHere’s a quote from a fellow independent consultant that articulates some of the angst and psychological gear grinding when chronos and kairos meet:  I am constantly hearing people say to me - “you work too much. You need to slow down. Take a break. Shouldn’t you be working less as a consultant? Isn’t that thepoint?”  I just about worked from Jan straight through summer, - 7 days always on - even in Cannes, even in pretty beachside places.. and phew, summer is always full on as a consultant. And this year, I paid a hefty price of stress on my body and thus am dealing with it. So now am taking 4 weeks off (as best I can which means just one client vs many - I am, me after all) in the fall. The response is, “must be nice. Wow. Who gets to do that?!”  If I change the dialogue to, “I certainly feel I earned some time off”… I get the same response. “Wow, must be nice to not have to work all the time. Consulting must be great business!”  I’ve really struggled with not feeling frustrated with these comments and taking them personally. Taking a set bulk of time off doesn’t mean I work less. Having flexibility to go to things during the day also doesn’t mean I work less than others - it’s a different cadence.  When we work on our own, or own a small business - we get amazing flexibility. But we also don’t have fixed incomes and ‘PTO.” PTO - ha! On your own, you have to use different muscle and motivation to often work doubly hard and smarter. Over the years, I’ve felt that sometimes the guilt of not working, is so intense it’s hard to actually commit to a break… Someone a few weeks ago told me, as solo entrepreneurs - you are always future-minded, and the present can be a challenge sometimes to simply put pencils down and live in it. That resonated with me. Sometimes I think I’m getting better at it. Sometimes it’s two steps back.  But hopefully, finding a way to let go of that judgement I’ve felt when people say - wow must be nice.. and instead just say, YUP IT ISAmen to this. The independent life is full of new kinds of tradeoffs, and this can cause a lot of friction when Chronos and Kairos meet. We can return to that chart above to better understand where gears can grind:                             Full-time worker “Discrete step changes”        Grinding Gears        Indie consultant “Always-on and self directed”                            Identity        Defined by your job title — changes when you get a new job.        “You’re always launching something!” Hard to keep a stable idea of what you do, launching ideas faster than chronos is comfortable.        Self-defined, renewed and pivoted as often as you like.                    Income &amp; pay raises        Income fixed by job. Pay review cycle is typically yearly.        Can you pay the bills? Stability?        Monthly/quarterly/yearly — how you track it is up to you and highly variable, depending on client load and billable rates.                    Vacations and time off        A few weeks a year, booked in advance.        We can’t just go to Hawaii next week! My work needs to know if we can book those two weeks in the summer.        Time off can happen when client work gets slow, sometimes on a moment’s notice.                    Job hunting        When you’re laid off or actively looking for a new job        How do I describe what you do? You’re always changing how you describe yourself and your work.        Constantly seeking new clients and connections.                    Job satisfaction        Depends on step changes (new boss, new job).        Highly variable job satisfaction.        Always fluctuating, dependent on evergreen satisfaction.                    Learning &amp; development        Formalized skills ladder, often with conference budget and courses available so long as you stay in your lane.        Self directed learning with plenty of room for experimentation. Everything paid for out of pocket.                     Part of the problem here is that it’s easy to describe the differences between full time (chronos) work and indie (kairos) work - but you don’t really internalize and understand the differences until you live them. And many of these changes happen to deep rooted concepts like financial stability, identity and our sense of self worth.Because the indie path removes all sense of validation, credentialing and identity you might have to take some things seriously even if they’re not client work. Assembling and recreating all the pieces of a full-time career is non trivial and requires a patchwork assemblage of projects - the jigsaw of independence.Conclusion: the only way out is inThe key insight underpinning everything here is that:  As an independent worker your relationship to time, stress, money and rest all need to re-negotiated. To create a sustainable independent path you need to create new routines, new ways of working and new ways of skiving off.  Navigating these changes requires a deep introspection and self-analysis to notice how you feel when you’re busy, to notice what kinds of work light you up, to notice how you feel when you’ve got no work.It’s not that the only way out is through, but rather the only way out is in(side). You need to learn to be self aware in a continual way - to be always keeping track of your stress, motivations, incentives and energy.Walking the path of an indie consultant you will learn to live an alternative path outside of all kinds of “normal” structures - this can be disorienting and demoralizing but ultimately it puts you in control of your own time, energy and identity in a way that full-time work can’t.I remember clearly in the early days of consulting — I met someone I respected who managed a ton of different projects at once — it was noon outside Whole Foods. He had his feet up on a bench, sitting in the sunshine and eating some sushi.I asked him, “How do you do it? You do so much and you’re sitting here eating sushi!” He said, “It’s simple; you can do it too. The sushi is right inside and it’s only $10.”Your mindset and your energy dictate your capacity far more than actual time — Chronos time. Learn to embrace kairos time and just-in-time living to build a more sustainable independent practice and better understand your own headspace.

It might be the best way! It’s certainly the most well understood.But what about some other ways?I’m inspired by Nadia’s post reimagining the PhD, essentially creating a personal assemblage of learning funded by a mixture of sources:I’d describe my time from 2015-2020 (when the book will be published) in three distinct phases:Phase I: 2015-2016: Discovery, exploration, initial research, hypothesis generation (funded by the Ford Foundation)Phase II: 2016-2018: Experience, experimenting, hypothesis testing (working at GitHub)Phase III: 2018-2020: Refining, summarizing, consolidation (funded by Protocol Labs)Nadia Eghbal https://nadiaeghbal.com/phdAnd by Andy’s notes on life as an independent researcher:When I left Khan Academy in early 2019, my (very understanding) wife and I made a rough plan: in 2019, I’d focus on the work and avoid thinking about funding at all; in 2020, I’d figure out some plan for sustainability and begin moving towards it; hopefully by the end of 2021, we’d stop burning cash. My collaborator Michael Nielsen suggested we set up a Patreon to solicit funding for our work, and I agreed, not thinking much of it. He’s now moved on, but I’m quite grateful to him for that early nudge.Less than two years later, my patrons have crowdfunded roughly a graduate student’s fellowship grant. It’s not lucrative, but it’s enough to cover my living expenses. That’s an important milestone! So long as this income stream continues, my runway has been extended indefinitely—or at least until I start getting nervous about not being able to save. My goal was to end 2020 with a plan for how to eventually fund my work, but I’m astonished to now find myself ending 2020 with solid funding in hand.Andy Matuschak https://andymatuschak.org/2020/These models are great - bridging self-directed work, working in public and subscription revenue from individuals - but we’ve yet to see many examples of this working beyond the individual.Well, actually that’s not quite true.We’re beginning to see individual creators bundling together (e.g. the everything bundle), and there are examples of companies that are at least partially audience-funded (e.g. are.na’s investment campaign).Building an Independent Research LabSo, what if we combined these ideas to imagine an independent research lab that’s funded (at least partially) by their audience?Phase 1: Audience-research fit. I’m imagining that the best way to get started is to announce a paid subscription newsletter. It’s essentially proving there’s an audience-research fit for the work. Thinking about, exploring and sketching ideas and thoughts. Matt already blogs like a machine so this should be easy. Importantly at this step - it’s about gathering subscribers that want the research notes but also want to pre-fund the research lab.Phase 2: Small artefacts. Just like NPR does a pledge drive I think you could run some small crowd-funding campaigns to fund the work against some deliberate research streams. Matt has some ideas already (“a proof of concept of a zero-data connected product platform”!) and I think you could easily imagine these being self-contained enough to run a small crowd-funding campaign around. Those funds would essentially allow you to bring together a small team to focus on the problem for a defined length of time. Nice.Phase 3: Team assemblage. Here’s where the analogy to the everything bundle starts to get interesting. If phase 1 &amp; 2 work then you may end up in the situation where you could actually assemble a few different independent researchers together. This is where you begin to move from independent researcher to independent research lab. What if there’s a handful of folks all doing step 1? If you’re far enough along you might realistically bundle together a few and.. hey presto you have a research lab!A crazy idea? Perhaps. But folks like Matt who already have blogging skillz and a proven track record might be able to pull it off.Mixing Individual &amp; Institutional BackersOne unresolved tension here is how to mix individual backers with institutional backers. Andy covered his first year’s expenses via a grant from Emergent Ventures for example. This might be a strong argument for a more sophisticated platform than Substack to run the subscriptions through - ideally you’d like some nice way to combine individual backers and institutional backers.And maybe there’s a way to put consulting inside this research frame also? Ben Pieratt’s live pre-brand experiments are intriguing as as a new model of funding work and working in public.Research Director as ShowrunnerThis whole idea works because I think there’s a strong analogy between the research director of a research lab and a showrunner / worldbuilder. I’m no expert but I have a hunch that research labs only succeed with a strong willed, opinionated research director at the helm who can steer the vision, create worlds before they’re ready and secure funding.Why not do that in public with a mixture of individual and institutional backers?–Matt - how long would it take you to raise 7 figures of funding to get your research lab off the ground? Compared with how long it would take you to raise 6 figures from subscribers willing to make a few initial bets?Just a thought.–Update #1: Andy points me to Martin’s blog where he says this:You might be wondering: even if I get enough Patreon funding to cover my own living expenses, itseems unlikely that I will be able to crowdfund a team of five to ten people. Fortunately, I havefound over the last years that collaboration does not require all team members to be funded out ofthe same purse. I constantly collaborate with people without being responsible for their payroll.In open source, it is common for contributors to a project to be employed by several differentorganisations, and indeed such diversity makes projects better and more resilient.I work closely with the Ink &amp; Switch lab, who have their ownfunding. Some of my collaborators are PhD students who have their own stipends, or research fellowswho have their own grants. We come together because of our common interests, and because nobody istrying to profit from the others. We have a vision of the future that we want to realise, and thefunding just lets us pay the bills as we work towards the greater goal.Martin Kleppmann https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/02/23/patreon.htmlInteresting!Update #2: Perhaps a more interesting and relevant model for organizations being crowd-funded is not Are.na but Athens Research which has a full community-funding model in place….Update #3: Peter has some great thoughts in his response:If you attempt to approach an area of research with the wrong type of funding, it will invariably fail. Any money isn’t necessarily better than no money. The right type of money is better than no money. In other words:I think there’s a real and important role to play for publicly funded, but largely independent research labs.&nbsp;@thewavingcat https://thewavingcat.com/2021/02/public-interest-independent-research-labs/Update #4: Matt has blogged some inspiration and collected 14 research studios he’s keeping an eye on: http://interconnected.org/home/2021/03/15/labsUpdate #5: Sam posted a great little list of research studios and Ben too.Update #6: This Hacker News thread is worth a read: Ask HN: Anybody Started a Research Institute?"

But folks like Matt who already have blogging skillz and a proven track record might be able to pull it off.Mixing Individual &amp; Institutional BackersOne unresolved tension here is how to mix individual backers with institutional backers. Andy covered his first year’s expenses via a grant from Emergent Ventures for example. This might be a strong argument for a more sophisticated platform than Substack to run the subscriptions through - ideally you’d like some nice way to combine individual backers and institutional backers.And maybe there’s a way to put consulting inside this research frame also? Ben Pieratt’s live pre-brand experiments are intriguing as as a new model of funding work and working in public.Research Director as ShowrunnerThis whole idea works because I think there’s a strong analogy between the research director of a research lab and a showrunner / worldbuilder. I’m no expert but I have a hunch that research labs only succeed with a strong willed, opinionated research director at the helm who can steer the vision, create worlds before they’re ready and secure funding.Why not do that in public with a mixture of individual and institutional backers?–Matt - how long would it take you to raise 7 figures of funding to get your research lab off the ground? Compared with how long it would take you to raise 6 figures from subscribers willing to make a few initial bets?Just a thought.–Update #1: Andy points me to Martin’s blog where he says this:You might be wondering: even if I get enough Patreon funding to cover my own living expenses, itseems unlikely that I will be able to crowdfund a team of five to ten people. Fortunately, I havefound over the last years that collaboration does not require all team members to be funded out ofthe same purse. I constantly collaborate with people without being responsible for their payroll.In open source, it is common for contributors to a project to be employed by several differentorganisations, and indeed such diversity makes projects better and more resilient.I work closely with the Ink &amp; Switch lab, who have their ownfunding. Some of my collaborators are PhD students who have their own stipends, or research fellowswho have their own grants. We come together because of our common interests, and because nobody istrying to profit from the others. We have a vision of the future that we want to realise, and thefunding just lets us pay the bills as we work towards the greater goal.Martin Kleppmann https://martin.kleppmann.com/2021/02/23/patreon.htmlInteresting!Update #2: Perhaps a more interesting and relevant model for organizations being crowd-funded is not Are.na but Athens Research which has a full community-funding model in place….Update #3: Peter has some great thoughts in his response:If you attempt to approach an area of research with the wrong type of funding, it will invariably fail. Any money isn’t necessarily better than no money. The right type of money is better than no money. In other words:I think there’s a real and important role to play for publicly funded, but largely independent research labs.&nbsp;@thewavingcat https://thewavingcat.com/2021/02/public-interest-independent-research-labs/Update #4: Matt has blogged some inspiration and collected 14 research studios he’s keeping an eye on: http://interconnected.org/home/2021/03/15/labsUpdate #5: Sam posted a great little list of research studios and Ben too.Update #6: This Hacker News thread is worth a read: Ask HN: Anybody Started a Research Institute?"

  "content": "Money is having a bit of a moment right now.Against the backdrop of Gamestop share trading via /r/wallstreetbets, and people buying tweets as NFTs, sometimes for ~$2k we’ve never seen more experimentation of media, markets and narratives.In the middle of this - there’s a little experiment, that might turn out to be a big idea. John Palmer is launching his next essay as an NFT crypto-asset, with a pre-sale for the essay token:I'm really excited to be trying something new this week: using crypto to crowdfund the next essay I'm writing, titled 'Scissor Labels.'Instead of publishing my work for free, or putting it behind a paywall, I'm doing something in between: raising funds to produce a new essay in exchange for ownership of the work. This will allow me to devote my full time to writing the piece, while allowing it to exist as a public good for anyone to read.Below is Mirror's new Crowdfunding Block, which contains everything you need to know about backing this project. The crowdfund will go live on Thursday, January 28th at 12pm PT. https://j.mirror.xyz/OgVaYso25gEqxn7N4RyPnPbMO9pbNQJZQKEUvV9pxv8Paid Subscribers vs Tokenized EssaysThe existing Substack model is also having a moment. We’re living through a cambrian explosion of creators going straight to audience. The same week Slate Star Codex re-launches on Substack, Twitter acquires paid newsletter platform Revue and the Everything bundle raises $600k and launches their own platform.The Substack model has proven highly effective. But it’s not the only model. Let’s sketch out a potential end-goal for an alternative tokenized model.Today, your paid substack looks like this:A flat fee per month, with a mix of paid and free newsletters. The paid ones are what you pay for, the free ones build hype and build audience.Under tokenized model you get something that looks like this:Where every post is free to read but every essay is an NFT - tradeable and ownable. It’s the same kind of idea of hype vs value - but skewed in some interesting ways.But where this gets really interesting is when you add the pre-sale component that John is pioneering. Then you get something like this:Here - every essay is a tradeable ownable NFT asset but upcoming essays go on sale via pre-sale of the tokens. This model allows all essays to be free to read but with significant hype and buzz-building potential of the pre-sale model.Over time it’s not hard to imagine this model providing significant returns. How much do you think seminal blog posts like status as a service or the gervais principle might fetch as ownable NFTs?Crypto Models Without Crypto GatekeepersWhat’s most interesting about this model is that the crypto-economics are all sub-surface. The essays are free to read so the majority of your audience is free to ignore the NFTs and simply enjoy the content. It’s a crypto implementation that doesn’t require large technical hurdles for the majority of your audience.A New Kind of BundlingOk, but what if we keep extending this idea? Bundling is one of the next big ideas for platforms like Substack and bundles can make very obvious economic sense. But today - they typically require you to bundle platform and payment. This crytpo-economic model of tokenized essays however allows for a radical new way of bundling. Creators can bundle not at the platform layer (i.e. publishing at the same place) but at the protocol layer (i.e. by selling their works on the same token).Through collaborating on a single token it’s possible to create an economic bundle distinct from the platform bundle - allowing all sorts of new ideas - and ownership models.Honestly, I’m no expert in NFTs or crypto but I’m excited for the coming wave that might just usher in some exciting new models. And maybe we’ll bring back blogging in the process.–Update #1: One more observation. Just like the Friends with Benefits tokenized community you can automatically unlock other things (e.g. communities, assets, access) to anyone who currently owns one of your essays. This might be a nice elegant way to open up newsletter+community style models…..Update #2: Perhaps this also unlocks even more radical forms of bundling - where there are ventures part employer owned, part individual owned. Or part community owned, exit to community style.Update #3: John’s crowd-funding was successful:Writers. @john_c_palmer just raised more than $13,000 to write an essay. That is probably more than you&#39;d get paid to write elsewhere. Check out @viamirror - https://t.co/E92SDwNwA5&mdash; Trev🙃r ~ skeet.eth (@whatdotcd) January 28, 2021"

  "title": "The Consultant Out of Time",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/26/kairos/",
  "date": "January 26, 2021",
  "content": "As a consultant you often find yourself working with multiple clients at once - switching between clients, contexts, businesses and engagement models. Sometimes several times a day.This context switching can be exhausting.If you don’t manage it correctly, you’ll run out of time. You’ll always feel like you’ve got your back against the wall - feeling like you have to juggle multiple client projects while also running business admin and striving to keep generating new clients.The title of this chapter is both the problem and the solution - to prevent the consultant from running out of time, the consultant has to operate outside the time perspective that your clients are operating in.Both deadlines and deliverables are designed for legibility - for the control and measurement of work - not for effectiveness. Once we embrace this we can learn to operate on shorter, faster feedback loops where our goal is not creating deliverables and meeting deadlines but creating momentum and change.This represents a mindset shift and different philosophy - that embraces context switching as core to the practice of consulting, and views context-switching as an advantage for the consultant. When done well, this approach allows you to work “just in time”, rejecting formalized deliverables and instead working on smaller, faster, more effective pieces of work that can save you 80% of the time.Operating this way is the key to dealing with multiple clients in parallel while avoiding burnout.In short - you need to think about time and tempo differently.Two ideas we’re going to return to often in this post:  Clock time is what the Greeks called Chronos - fixed, measurable, predictable time. Living in clock time is about carving time into fixed units. Employees inside organizations operate on clock time.  Narrative time is what the Greeks called Kairos - time moves when something happens. Living in narrative time is about carving time into events. Indie consultants operate on narrative time.However, you can’t start a client engagement in narrative time, rejecting deliverables and deadlines - instead you need to navigate and transition from clock time to narrative time. We’ll explore all of that in this post. But first, let’s look at how time works inside organizations to see why the status quo exists.Part 1: Clock Time Rules the WorldClock time is the operating logic of the working world - the time clock was invented to keep track of workers and calculate pay.Early time clock, made by National Time Recorder Co. Ltd. of Blackfriars, LondonEmployees Watch The ClockEmployees think about time by watching the clock. It’s almost the defining characteristic of full time work - to be inside a structure that operates in predictable and measurable beats.This is no accident. Clock time provides psychological safety and predictability for the worker and provides legibility and control for the employer. It’s part of the “job to be done” of full time work - providing employees shelter from narrative time.Employees are hired, paid and measured in fixed, measurable clock time.This creates expectations and tempo inside an organization - for example it’s typically against the rules for someone to ask for a piece of work with &lt; 1 day turnaround1.However, the further up the organization you go, the more you need to operate outside of clock time. Executives typically straddle clock time and narrative time, which is partly why being a manager/leader can be so draining. There’s no psychological safety of clock time; instead, you’re living according to narrative time. There’s no hiding behind your job description or your assigned priorities - when something needs to happen, it needs to happen, and you are supposed to find a way to make that work (often without disrupting your team’s clock time too much!).Executives already understand that productivity measured in time is meaningless - there’s no hiding behind “I did the work you asked on time”. It’s about progress, momentum, outputs, and results. And those things don’t work on clock time - they come in leaps and bounds, fits and starts.The Clock Chimes Midnight - It’s Crash TimeOf course even employees aren’t completely sheltered from narrative time. Every organization has a clock and sometimes that clock crashes. Narrative time overwhelmingly washes over the organization and everyone is pulled into narrative time.Sometimes this is an external event, like when a competitor launches a surprise, or some PR crisis happens. Or it can be an internal event, like when the CEO suddenly becomes obsessed with something new.When the clock chimes midnight, suddenly everyone is operating on narrative time - “war rooms”, “workshops”, “crunch time”. Everyone is scrambling to operate on extremely tight feedback loops - a conversation in the morning has to affect what work gets done in the afternoon.These periods are stressful for Chronos workers - being lifted out of clock time and into narrative time. The unwritten rules say that an organization can only do this infrequently to employees. It causes psychological anguish and burnout for clock-time employees.Executives operate above the Clock LineAt some point in every organization, as you get more senior, you can no longer operate fully on clock time. You cross over the clock line and into narrative time. Executives, operating above-the-clock-line are forced to live in narrative time - translating shifting real-time priorities into legible, predictable work for their below-the-clock line teams2.Where the clock line sits within an organization is highly variable, depending on the type and size of the company, but it’s usually one level below the “senior management” inner circle. The group of executives that is first called when “something happens” is the inner circle and fully above the clock line.Alive/dead players here as per Samo Burja’s definition.As a consultant, it’s important to try and identify the clock line of the organization and recognize whether you’re above or below the line. Ideally, as you advance in your consulting career, you should be striving and aiming for above-the-line clients, projects, and points of contact.But even if your primary point of contact is below the clock line, it’s important to recognize that every ask, deliverable, and project from the client likely started from an above-the-line ask:Your point of contact might take a measured approach to the project, reflecting their below-the-clock-line situation, but there’s always a more urgent, narrative context somewhere above waiting to be discovered.Enter the Kairos Consultant.Part 2: The Kairos ConsultantUnderstanding the clock line and the distinction between chronos and kairos is important for consultants that want to both control their own time management skills and become invaluable for clients by focusing on business value at all times.Time Out by Dave Brubeck quartet with the magnificent cover from Neil FujitaDeadlines Don’t ExistOne of the best pieces of advice my brother ever gave me: Deadlines (as handed from client to consultant) don’t exist. This is the gateway drug to suspending clock time and existing purely in narrative time.Typically, when you agree to a deadline with a client it’s to enforce legibility. It’s a way for the client to feel they’re in control and they’re getting their money’s worth, making sure the consultant is putting in the hours and doing the work.But most of the time the actual deadline is entirely arbitrary and not linked to a dependency or decision.For example, let’s say the client is looking for a complete competitive analysis. You discuss and agree to the deliverable 4 weeks from now. It’s a made up date that the client is using to control the relationship - to measure your output and ensure work is being done.Where there is a strict time deadline, it’s because the work you’re doing is an input to something else.  A real example from my own work - the client asks for a competitive benchmark, but when you offer a three-week completion time they push back. Asking what’s driving the urgency, you discover that there is a quarterly executive meeting next week and that they need two slides on competitive landscape for the presentation. Ok! Now we know where the real deadline is and what the real ask is - not only can we deliver that more easily in the timeframe but we also have a much better understanding of what this need is and who the stakeholders are. We can even go as far as creating the two slides for them (not something you’d typically create as part of a competitive analysis).Once you’ve been through this a few times, your instincts get honed; you’re always seeking the next level of insight into why you’re doing this work for the client and why now. Understanding the dependencies and temporal relevance of the work will unlock insights into the nested contexts of the work you’re doing.Deliverables don’t existOnce you start seeking these insights and dependencies, you can start to unlock a more efficient way of working, and this is the heart of “time management for independent consultants,” which is to only do 20% of the work.You might think I’m joking, but it is kind of that simple.Anyone who’s worked as a consultant or agency will tell you that only half of the work is useful. You just don’t know which half ahead of time!Well, it turns out that you can train yourself to guess which bits are the most useful, and you can deliberately operate in ways that allow you to discover which bits are most useful.How do you do this?  Understand the organizational context  Understand the temporal dependencies  Deliver a just-in-time rough version of the necessary deliverable  Iterate as needed, while driving change throughAlways ask “once I deliver this piece of work, what will the client do with it?” What change or impact will it have? How can we drive towards that change/impact more directly, instead of chasing the deliverable, which is (likely) only a poor proxy in the first place?The key here is delivering unfinished work. Delivering a WIP solution allows you to iteratively uncover the clients’ reaction, and find out what they’re going to do with it.How does this work? Here’s one mental model of doing work for clients:  Client request kicks off a discussion of some work to be done. A deadline is agreed with the consultant.  Consultant works on the deliverable  Some kind of review or presentation to the client  Final round of revisions / polish based on the review  Final delivery of the deliverable.If you’ve operated in this way with clients, you’ll notice two common failure modes:  While working on the deliverable, you often find that your initial assumptions of the deliverable are off - you don’t have enough information to do the work properly and/or you don’t have a clear enough understanding of what form the output should take  When you finally wrap up the deliverable it isn’t that effective at the client’s organization - what did they do with it? What are the next steps?Here’s an example from my own work where adhering too tightly to the named deliverables wasn’t the approach  The client asked for an “audience development strategy” and that was the line item in the SOW. I set to work and created a presentation that I’m still quite proud of - it’s a well crafted deck with a ton of good ideas. But I forgot to consider what the client would actually do with the audience development strategy.  At the client review stage - when 80% of the hours from the SOW have already been used - the client starts to open up about which resources and which editors are able to pick up some of these projects.  It’s at this point that I realize the error of my ways - creating the strategy deliverable, a tight presentation has neglected to closely consider the lived reality of the client and their actual needs. Despite the fact that they asked for a strategy and pushed for it in the SOW - we would have been in a much better spot if we’d had more frequent check-ins and abandoned the formalized deliverable much earlier.  Unfortunately, with 80% of the hours spent crafting the presentation there’s not enough room left in the project to properly handle the project planning / scoping / prioritization that happens afterwards (that the client actually wants) and there’s not enough value from the work done for the client to extend the scope and buy more time.  So the engagement ends and the client is only partially satisfied.Instead, consider a way of working that’s more collaborative and more iterative. It might go something like this:  Client request for a deliverable  Consultant sketches out possible outcomes, possible value - using back of the envelope data analysis or estimates  Check in and review with the client - with a focus on “how do we act on this information?”  Adjusting our final expectations and beginning work on implementation even before we’ve finished our initial formalized deliverable  Refining and polishing only those ideas that need formal presentation - and leaving the rest as estimates or outlines.Four key advantages of this approach:  Collaborate and uncover the information you need (you shape the deliverable with the client) and understand why they need it  By the second or third check-in you’re already moving forward, adding other people in the org to focus on the next steps as there’s enough clarity with the deliverable to move forward to the next step  Less elapsed time for the client - it’s faster  Less work time for the consultant - it’s more efficientAnd note - that often this approach leads somewhere different and more useful than you’d have arrived following the client request -&gt; deliverable model. See later on for a worked example.This is uniquely tailored to the kind of consulting work that is improv based and capacity expanding. Some kinds of work are more formalized and require more hard deliverables. For example, you might need to create a brand deck as a polished object, or a website design.But even for these more “formal” deliverables, you can take a more iterative and collaborative approach to various sections or parts of the work. And never lose sight of the ultimate objective.Some people call this approach outcomes over outputs, for example this project around web design that re-scopes based on outcomes not outputs:  Taproot leaders described the system that they wanted to build in terms of its features: It would have a way for volunteers to sign up, a way for volunteers to list their skills, a way for nonprofit organizations to look up volunteers based on these skills, and so on. We were concerned about this feature list. It was a long list, and although each item seemed reasonable, we thought we might be able to deliver more value faster with a smaller set of features.Recognizing &amp; Rejecting Formalized DeliverablesThe key to operating in this fashion is to scrutinize the formalized, named deliverables of your field. Every industry has their own language and concepts for what “deliverables” are expected. This standardization arises from a need for legibility and accountability - they arise because clients need standardized ways of asking for work from agencies, accepting proposals etc. Formalized deliverables however do not always map to where the most value can be created! Consider this list from the SEO industry:  Site audits  Keyword research  Competitive analysis  Link auditsOr this list from the UX design field:  Service blueprint  Consumer journey map  Personas  Ecosystem map  Competitive auditLegible deliverables that everyone agrees to are useful for clients to source bids from agencies, and for agencies to standardize and price work. But for independent consultants your advantage is operating on a different tempo - seeking more agile or alternative ways of working.  Example from my own work. A client engaged with me to do an “SEO audit” of their site (the named deliverable). After spending a few hours poking around it was abundantly clear that the opportunity ahead was convincing the organization to create more content - not from optimizing existing content or fixing technology issues.  After coming to this realization I presented some very small lift technical improvements that we can provide to the product team, outlined a rough back of the envelope market-size for the content opportunity and ran my client through my thinking.  From here the back of the envelope market sizing became slightly more robust and my point of contact and I then called a meeting with the head of the editorial team to discuss ways forward and better understand budgets, expectations and outputs from the content team.  In this example an initial request for a site audit becomes a faster, more iterative project that ends up exploring a business case for content investment - far away from the original ask but still focused on value for the client.Note how in this example we never actually reach the polished deliverable stage - instead there’s a handful of WIP documents, decks and ideas. Depending on the size and formality of the client we might need a formalized content investment case but in this example the client is smaller and we can operate without formalizing into polished documents.Doing Work No One Asked For  - aka Kairos ProjectsIf we double down on the idea of outcomes over outputs, it becomes obvious that there are certain types of work that we should instigate without asking. With the consultant’s unique view of the client (both client-as-organization and client-as-point-of-contact) we have the ability to spot self-directed and useful pieces of work.Kairos projects are things that nobody asked for, but which can be derived from the executives’ outcomes, both personal and organizational.The key, however, is not to sign up for arbitrary deliverables - but rather seek “just in time” WIP versions of the work to provide value and create momentum.Context-less plays often look very little like the formalized “named” deliverables that your industry might expect. Some of the context-less plays I’ve worked on recently:  Building a quick but useful exec-level dashboard in Data Studio  Creating a one-sentence narrative of the objectives of the executive to better communicate and organize the work across teams  Providing a list of 20 candidates on LinkedIn that fit the profile of the VP we’re trying to hireOften this context-less work can feel junior or routine. The key is that we’re focusing on the highest value work right now - oftentimes the key to unlocking momentum and growth is not fancy or difficult, but rather it’s about just doing the right thing at the right time.The key idea is understanding the client’s objectives and anticipating their needsConsider this example where an executive is looking to create a growth marketing team from scratch. The red bubbles are the client’s objectives, and the yellow bubbles are the example “just in time” Kairos projects that you might be able to work on to support those objectives:Juggling Multiple Clients in Kairos TimeConsultants are notorious for spending time embedded inside client organizations (in previous times, physically; now, remotely). This embedded nature can be taxing when it comes to juggling and managing multiple clients at once.When you’re working with senior execs - say the CEO of one company and the CMO of another - neither wants you to be “out of commission” for a few days at a time while you’re on-site with another client.I’ve been in this spot many times and it’s taxing - juggling time on executives calendars is hard at the best of times, let alone juggling executive’s calendars at multiple clients at once.The only way to handle this is by embracing the “just in time” value creation and stealing time from one client for another. But that can only work if the kind of work you’re delivering is fast and small - not large and slow. In short, signing yourself up for Chronos-based deliverables will quickly jam your time capacity - whereas operating on Kairos-based just in time work can be juggled, rearranged and done just-in-time more easily.I’ve lost count of the times I’ve taken a meeting for one client while technically working a full-day for another client. This kind of time splicing is the only way to handle the kind of Kairos effective consulting that I practice.As Venkatesh points out - for clients that know you well, the more valuable a spontaneous conversation can be:Your employee-instincts will balk at the idea of responding to client emails in &lt; 10 minutes. But I use this as the proto example of a “ridiculous expectation” - except it’s exactly the kind of situation you find yourself in a lot as an independent.The trick to responding to clients is not strictly high availability but rather a spider sense of the client’s stress. This enables you to parse in real time how dependent on you the client is.However this cuts both ways. Sometimes you can work a “full day” for a client but have relatively little valuable work to provide, so spend time working on more effective work for other clients - safe in the realization that you’ll do the same for this client when the need arises.This approach is fully decoupling billable hours and clock time from value creation, and frankly can be existentially terrifying (“what are they paying me for?”) but is actually a completely sound approach so long as you’re always returning to your north star:What are my client’s ultimate objectives and what is the most effective thing I can do for the client right now?And being ok with the answer sometimes being: nothing (or very little).This is because there’s a failure mode which is doing too much - disrupting the client’s system too much. Sometimes you need to let the work flow, let the changes propagate, observe, and wait.You can’t take this approach on day one though. You’d ruin your trust. So we need to map out how you transition from clock time to narrative time, from chronos to kairos.Part 3: Steering by Chronos / Steering by KairosIn order to be able to work on kairos time, we need to lay the groundwork and create the right environment. What ingredients are necessary to be able to operate in this way?  Flexible / broad enough scope of work (SOW)  Trust established between client/consultant  A good understanding of your point of contact, their working styles and personality  Enough wider context of the organizationYou likely won’t start an engagement with all these pieces in place. You can’t walk into an engagement and ignore their request for deliverables on day one.However, it is equally true that if you’re still operating in a request -&gt; deliverable mindset six months into an engagement, you’re almost certainly not being as effective and valuable as you could be.So you need to adapt your approach with a client over time. You start off steering by chronos and transition to steering by kairos.Click image to open full size or pinch to zoomEarly engagement: Steering by ChronosIn the original contract, you have to agree on deliverables and outline a timeline:  I will do X by YUnfortunately, at the beginning of the project the client needs, organizational dynamics, and project scope are almost always poorly defined and only map loosely to what the client actually needs and where you’re best placed to offer value.However, it’s important to deliver on your initial deliverables - it’s how you build trust. In parallel however you need to be learning how to work with the organization, merging with their tempo and expanding your contexts so that you can eventually step outside of chronos time.            Doing the work      Expanding your contexts                  Agree to deliverables, meet relevant stakeholders      Understand organizational tempo, understand culture, power dynamics, and the real problems at play, organizational history, calendar weather of execs              Deliver X by Y      Gain wider organizational context              Scheduled meetings &amp; communication      Map out power &amp; status, find alive players              Merge with the organizations chronos tempo - learn how to work within their rhythms      Learn working style of your point of contact      Good questions to reflect on if you’re finding yourself stuck in Chronos time:  Have I met my point of contact’s boss?  Do I understand the top 3-5 priorities for the whole organization?  What are my point of contact’s ambitions?  Is my point of contact above or below the clock line?This beginning engagement can last as short as a few weeks, or as long as six months, depending on how big the client is and how rigid the project is. During this period as a consultant, you’re mostly evaluated on the quality of your deliverables; how well you can deliver against the scope you’re given.The failure mode, meanwhile, is not doing enough during this time to learn about how the organization actually works: mapping power &amp; status &amp; understanding their culture.Eventually however, steering by Chronos and creating deliverable after deliverable will exhaust you - you’re stuck in a world of trying to be effective as a full time employee but with only a fraction of the time.Switching Gears to KairosSwitching gears mid-engagement is hard - the easy thing to do is to settle into established ways of working with your point of contact. But there’s always a way to go deeper.Sometimes the client is working with you to change and focus on value creation over time billed, sometimes they’re actively working against it. Either way, your job is to seek enough organizational context for your work and for your point of contact to be able to see a way to deliver value beyond, around and in-between the defined deliverables.As you spot these opportunities, it’s time to look for ways to cross the clock line and operate on a fast feedback schedule. This might look something like:  “Hey, want to spend an hour working on the board deck together?”  “You know I had a thought about how we talk about this project internally”  “Mind if I show you something I was just sketching out?”You’re basically inviting the client into a more collaborative, working relationship to explore work that sits outside of what a formal deliverable might look like.As you begin to do this - you’ll start to build up a relationship with the client where you can push back on more formalized deliverables:  “Instead of a full site audit let me just review the top priorities for us to discuss with the CPO?”  “Instead of a full customer research project let me talk to a few of the stakeholders across the leadership team and get their perspective and see what knowledge already exists inside the organization?”This kind of reframing of work helps teach the client that you’re focused on ultimate value, momentum, and outcome - not just the output of the deliverable.Late engagement: Steering by KairosOnce you reach the stage of steering by Kairos, there’s no end to how deeply you can play this game, so long as you’re focused on value creation. At this point it’s possible to build a more explicit working relationship designed around Kairos. For example this is where I’ve transitioned to a statement of work that reads “one phone call a week”.Once you’re operating on Kairos time you should be firmly anchored to creating value for your client-as-organization and client-as-individual. Helping the organization reach their goals, helping your point of contact succeed at their career, coaching them on new ways of working etc.At this stage, the consultant is evaluated primarily by how effective they are, beyond deliverables and output.Two examples of this transition from my own work:  Example: operating within a complex organizational structure can slow down your intuition. I was working with a larger organization and had initially agreed to run a brand workshop for each of their 9 sub-brands. This was a fairly large scope of work and a meaty project from the outset. Operating on-site with the client 3 days / week, however, made me feel like I would have a good chance of getting inside the client’s context to shift from deliverables to something more useful.  However - at least 3 months of work was spent running these brand workshops - planning, running, synthesizing, wrapping up. This deliverable-based work trapped me in Chronos time longer than I would have liked - partly because the client had a fairly complicated matrix organizational structure. It wasn’t at all clear who held the power and status inside the organization - with multiple layers of leadership for each of the sub-brands.  Ultimately, although we threw much of the workshop work away it was a necessary phase of work to build trust with my primary point of contact as well build trust across large parts of the organization. I was fortunate enough to throw much of it away and move onto more valuable projects better oriented to delivering value for the client but it’s a good reminder of the challenges of understanding your client’s organization and how it can slow you down.    Example: for smaller clients you can often break out of Chronos time in days not weeks. I was working with a startup a few years ago and we had agreed to a single day workshop to begin the project. This was the scope:    Following this initial day of work not only did I have some trust from the VP marketing, but we also had an agreed view of where value creation would come from. The follow-on scope looked like this:    But - note that all of the legibility and deliverables here are designed for finance gatekeepers. The actual work was already momentum and value based.In both of these examples, it’s the business size and complexity that dictates how quickly you can switch Chronos for Kairos.Wrapping Up  “Jazz is about freedom within discipline” - Dave BrubeckKairos consulting is an attempt to find freedom with discipline - to seek value creation even over adhering to the agreed scope and shape of work. It’s the only way to successfully integrate multiple high-value clients at the same time without reaching burnout.To be clear this Kairos approach is not somehow a way to be lazy on client projects. It’s just orienting your north star to your client’s north star and finding a way to manage your own time in the process.Ultimately, you will find your own tempo and balance of formalized work and improv work - and that’s a good thing. The specific balance and approach will need to fit your own working style, your type of work and your typical client profile. But one thing is clear - getting trapped in clock time is discipline without freedom.            Note that startups often operate on incredibly fast clocks - but there’s still a clock. And recognizing the mismatch between the exec teams clock and the employee clocks is a key idea for resolving tensions and frustrations. &#8617;              There’s a lot of overlap between the concepts of the clock line, above/below the API line from Venkatesh Rao and alive/dead players from Samo Burja that I’ll leave as an exercise for the reader. &#8617;      "

  "content": "Money is having a bit of a moment right now.Against the backdrop of Gamestop share trading via /r/wallstreetbets, and people buying tweets as NFTs, sometimes for ~$2k we’ve never seen more experimentation of media, markets and narratives.In the middle of this - there’s a little experiment, that might turn out to be a big idea. John Palmer is launching his next essay as an NFT crypto-asset, with a pre-sale for the essay token:I'm really excited to be trying something new this week: using crypto to crowdfund the next essay I'm writing, titled 'Scissor Labels.'Instead of publishing my work for free, or putting it behind a paywall, I'm doing something in between: raising funds to produce a new essay in exchange for ownership of the work. This will allow me to devote my full time to writing the piece, while allowing it to exist as a public good for anyone to read.Below is Mirror's new Crowdfunding Block, which contains everything you need to know about backing this project. The crowdfund will go live on Thursday, January 28th at 12pm PT. https://j.mirror.xyz/OgVaYso25gEqxn7N4RyPnPbMO9pbNQJZQKEUvV9pxv8Paid Subscribers vs Tokenized EssaysThe existing Substack model is also having a moment. We’re living through a cambrian explosion of creators going straight to audience. The same week Slate Star Codex re-launches on Substack, Twitter acquires paid newsletter platform Revue and the Everything bundle raises $600k and launches their own platform.The Substack model has proven highly effective. But it’s not the only model. Let’s sketch out a potential end-goal for an alternative tokenized model.Today, your paid substack looks like this:A flat fee per month, with a mix of paid and free newsletters. The paid ones are what you pay for, the free ones build hype and build audience.Under tokenized model you get something that looks like this:Where every post is free to read but every essay is an NFT - tradeable and ownable. It’s the same kind of idea of hype vs value - but skewed in some interesting ways.But where this gets really interesting is when you add the pre-sale component that John is pioneering. Then you get something like this:Here - every essay is a tradeable ownable NFT asset but upcoming essays go on sale via pre-sale of the tokens. This model allows all essays to be free to read but with significant hype and buzz-building potential of the pre-sale model.Over time it’s not hard to imagine this model providing significant returns. How much do you think seminal blog posts like status as a service or the gervais principle might fetch as ownable NFTs?Crypto Models Without Crypto GatekeepersWhat’s most interesting about this model is that the crypto-economics are all sub-surface. The essays are free to read so the majority of your audience is free to ignore the NFTs and simply enjoy the content. It’s a crypto implementation that doesn’t require large technical hurdles for the majority of your audience.A New Kind of BundlingOk, but what if we keep extending this idea? Bundling is one of the next big ideas for platforms like Substack and bundles can make very obvious economic sense. But today - they typically require you to bundle platform and payment. This crytpo-economic model of tokenized essays however allows for a radical new way of bundling. Creators can bundle not at the platform layer (i.e. publishing at the same place) but at the protocol layer (i.e. by selling their works on the same token).Through collaborating on a single token it’s possible to create an economic bundle distinct from the platform bundle - allowing all sorts of new ideas - and ownership models.Honestly, I’m no expert in NFTs or crypto but I’m excited for the coming wave that might just usher in some exciting new models. And maybe we’ll bring back blogging in the process.–Update #1: One more observation. Just like the Friends with Benefits tokenized community you can automatically unlock other things (e.g. communities, assets, access) to anyone who currently owns one of your essays. This might be a nice elegant way to open up newsletter+community style models…..Update #2: Perhaps this also unlocks even more radical forms of bundling - where there are ventures part employer owned, part individual owned. Or part community owned, exit to community style.Update #3: John’s crowd-funding was successful:Writers. @john_c_palmer just raised more than $13,000 to write an essay. That is probably more than you&#39;d get paid to write elsewhere. Check out @viamirror - https://t.co/E92SDwNwA5&mdash; Trev🙃r ~ skeet.eth (@whatdotcd) January 28, 2021"

  "title": "The Consultant Out of Time",
  "url": "/2021/01/26/kairos/",
  "date": "January 26, 2021",
  "content": "As a consultant you often find yourself working with multiple clients at once - switching between clients, contexts, businesses and engagement models. Sometimes several times a day.This context switching can be exhausting.If you don’t manage it correctly, you’ll run out of time. You’ll always feel like you’ve got your back against the wall - feeling like you have to juggle multiple client projects while also running business admin and striving to keep generating new clients.The title of this chapter is both the problem and the solution - to prevent the consultant from running out of time, the consultant has to operate outside the time perspective that your clients are operating in.Both deadlines and deliverables are designed for legibility - for the control and measurement of work - not for effectiveness. Once we embrace this we can learn to operate on shorter, faster feedback loops where our goal is not creating deliverables and meeting deadlines but creating momentum and change.This represents a mindset shift and different philosophy - that embraces context switching as core to the practice of consulting, and views context-switching as an advantage for the consultant. When done well, this approach allows you to work “just in time”, rejecting formalized deliverables and instead working on smaller, faster, more effective pieces of work that can save you 80% of the time.Operating this way is the key to dealing with multiple clients in parallel while avoiding burnout.In short - you need to think about time and tempo differently.Two ideas we’re going to return to often in this post:  Clock time is what the Greeks called Chronos - fixed, measurable, predictable time. Living in clock time is about carving time into fixed units. Employees inside organizations operate on clock time.  Narrative time is what the Greeks called Kairos - time moves when something happens. Living in narrative time is about carving time into events. Indie consultants operate on narrative time.However, you can’t start a client engagement in narrative time, rejecting deliverables and deadlines - instead you need to navigate and transition from clock time to narrative time. We’ll explore all of that in this post. But first, let’s look at how time works inside organizations to see why the status quo exists.Part 1: Clock Time Rules the WorldClock time is the operating logic of the working world - the time clock was invented to keep track of workers and calculate pay.Early time clock, made by National Time Recorder Co. Ltd. of Blackfriars, LondonEmployees Watch The ClockEmployees think about time by watching the clock. It’s almost the defining characteristic of full time work - to be inside a structure that operates in predictable and measurable beats.This is no accident. Clock time provides psychological safety and predictability for the worker and provides legibility and control for the employer. It’s part of the “job to be done” of full time work - providing employees shelter from narrative time.Employees are hired, paid and measured in fixed, measurable clock time.This creates expectations and tempo inside an organization - for example it’s typically against the rules for someone to ask for a piece of work with &lt; 1 day turnaround1.However, the further up the organization you go, the more you need to operate outside of clock time. Executives typically straddle clock time and narrative time, which is partly why being a manager/leader can be so draining. There’s no psychological safety of clock time; instead, you’re living according to narrative time. There’s no hiding behind your job description or your assigned priorities - when something needs to happen, it needs to happen, and you are supposed to find a way to make that work (often without disrupting your team’s clock time too much!).Executives already understand that productivity measured in time is meaningless - there’s no hiding behind “I did the work you asked on time”. It’s about progress, momentum, outputs, and results. And those things don’t work on clock time - they come in leaps and bounds, fits and starts.The Clock Chimes Midnight - It’s Crash TimeOf course even employees aren’t completely sheltered from narrative time. Every organization has a clock and sometimes that clock crashes. Narrative time overwhelmingly washes over the organization and everyone is pulled into narrative time.Sometimes this is an external event, like when a competitor launches a surprise, or some PR crisis happens. Or it can be an internal event, like when the CEO suddenly becomes obsessed with something new.When the clock chimes midnight, suddenly everyone is operating on narrative time - “war rooms”, “workshops”, “crunch time”. Everyone is scrambling to operate on extremely tight feedback loops - a conversation in the morning has to affect what work gets done in the afternoon.These periods are stressful for Chronos workers - being lifted out of clock time and into narrative time. The unwritten rules say that an organization can only do this infrequently to employees. It causes psychological anguish and burnout for clock-time employees.Executives operate above the Clock LineAt some point in every organization, as you get more senior, you can no longer operate fully on clock time. You cross over the clock line and into narrative time. Executives, operating above-the-clock-line are forced to live in narrative time - translating shifting real-time priorities into legible, predictable work for their below-the-clock line teams2.Where the clock line sits within an organization is highly variable, depending on the type and size of the company, but it’s usually one level below the “senior management” inner circle. The group of executives that is first called when “something happens” is the inner circle and fully above the clock line.Alive/dead players here as per Samo Burja’s definition.As a consultant, it’s important to try and identify the clock line of the organization and recognize whether you’re above or below the line. Ideally, as you advance in your consulting career, you should be striving and aiming for above-the-line clients, projects, and points of contact.But even if your primary point of contact is below the clock line, it’s important to recognize that every ask, deliverable, and project from the client likely started from an above-the-line ask:Your point of contact might take a measured approach to the project, reflecting their below-the-clock-line situation, but there’s always a more urgent, narrative context somewhere above waiting to be discovered.Enter the Kairos Consultant.Part 2: The Kairos ConsultantUnderstanding the clock line and the distinction between chronos and kairos is important for consultants that want to both control their own time management skills and become invaluable for clients by focusing on business value at all times.Time Out by Dave Brubeck quartet with the magnificent cover from Neil FujitaDeadlines Don’t ExistOne of the best pieces of advice my brother ever gave me: Deadlines (as handed from client to consultant) don’t exist. This is the gateway drug to suspending clock time and existing purely in narrative time.Typically, when you agree to a deadline with a client it’s to enforce legibility. It’s a way for the client to feel they’re in control and they’re getting their money’s worth, making sure the consultant is putting in the hours and doing the work.But most of the time the actual deadline is entirely arbitrary and not linked to a dependency or decision.For example, let’s say the client is looking for a complete competitive analysis. You discuss and agree to the deliverable 4 weeks from now. It’s a made up date that the client is using to control the relationship - to measure your output and ensure work is being done.Where there is a strict time deadline, it’s because the work you’re doing is an input to something else.  A real example from my own work - the client asks for a competitive benchmark, but when you offer a three-week completion time they push back. Asking what’s driving the urgency, you discover that there is a quarterly executive meeting next week and that they need two slides on competitive landscape for the presentation. Ok! Now we know where the real deadline is and what the real ask is - not only can we deliver that more easily in the timeframe but we also have a much better understanding of what this need is and who the stakeholders are. We can even go as far as creating the two slides for them (not something you’d typically create as part of a competitive analysis).Once you’ve been through this a few times, your instincts get honed; you’re always seeking the next level of insight into why you’re doing this work for the client and why now. Understanding the dependencies and temporal relevance of the work will unlock insights into the nested contexts of the work you’re doing.Deliverables don’t existOnce you start seeking these insights and dependencies, you can start to unlock a more efficient way of working, and this is the heart of “time management for independent consultants,” which is to only do 20% of the work.You might think I’m joking, but it is kind of that simple.Anyone who’s worked as a consultant or agency will tell you that only half of the work is useful. You just don’t know which half ahead of time!Well, it turns out that you can train yourself to guess which bits are the most useful, and you can deliberately operate in ways that allow you to discover which bits are most useful.How do you do this?  Understand the organizational context  Understand the temporal dependencies  Deliver a just-in-time rough version of the necessary deliverable  Iterate as needed, while driving change throughAlways ask “once I deliver this piece of work, what will the client do with it?” What change or impact will it have? How can we drive towards that change/impact more directly, instead of chasing the deliverable, which is (likely) only a poor proxy in the first place?The key here is delivering unfinished work. Delivering a WIP solution allows you to iteratively uncover the clients’ reaction, and find out what they’re going to do with it.How does this work? Here’s one mental model of doing work for clients:  Client request kicks off a discussion of some work to be done. A deadline is agreed with the consultant.  Consultant works on the deliverable  Some kind of review or presentation to the client  Final round of revisions / polish based on the review  Final delivery of the deliverable.If you’ve operated in this way with clients, you’ll notice two common failure modes:  While working on the deliverable, you often find that your initial assumptions of the deliverable are off - you don’t have enough information to do the work properly and/or you don’t have a clear enough understanding of what form the output should take  When you finally wrap up the deliverable it isn’t that effective at the client’s organization - what did they do with it? What are the next steps?Here’s an example from my own work where adhering too tightly to the named deliverables wasn’t the approach  The client asked for an “audience development strategy” and that was the line item in the SOW. I set to work and created a presentation that I’m still quite proud of - it’s a well crafted deck with a ton of good ideas. But I forgot to consider what the client would actually do with the audience development strategy.  At the client review stage - when 80% of the hours from the SOW have already been used - the client starts to open up about which resources and which editors are able to pick up some of these projects.  It’s at this point that I realize the error of my ways - creating the strategy deliverable, a tight presentation has neglected to closely consider the lived reality of the client and their actual needs. Despite the fact that they asked for a strategy and pushed for it in the SOW - we would have been in a much better spot if we’d had more frequent check-ins and abandoned the formalized deliverable much earlier.  Unfortunately, with 80% of the hours spent crafting the presentation there’s not enough room left in the project to properly handle the project planning / scoping / prioritization that happens afterwards (that the client actually wants) and there’s not enough value from the work done for the client to extend the scope and buy more time.  So the engagement ends and the client is only partially satisfied.Instead, consider a way of working that’s more collaborative and more iterative. It might go something like this:  Client request for a deliverable  Consultant sketches out possible outcomes, possible value - using back of the envelope data analysis or estimates  Check in and review with the client - with a focus on “how do we act on this information?”  Adjusting our final expectations and beginning work on implementation even before we’ve finished our initial formalized deliverable  Refining and polishing only those ideas that need formal presentation - and leaving the rest as estimates or outlines.Four key advantages of this approach:  Collaborate and uncover the information you need (you shape the deliverable with the client) and understand why they need it  By the second or third check-in you’re already moving forward, adding other people in the org to focus on the next steps as there’s enough clarity with the deliverable to move forward to the next step  Less elapsed time for the client - it’s faster  Less work time for the consultant - it’s more efficientAnd note - that often this approach leads somewhere different and more useful than you’d have arrived following the client request -&gt; deliverable model. See later on for a worked example.This is uniquely tailored to the kind of consulting work that is improv based and capacity expanding. Some kinds of work are more formalized and require more hard deliverables. For example, you might need to create a brand deck as a polished object, or a website design.But even for these more “formal” deliverables, you can take a more iterative and collaborative approach to various sections or parts of the work. And never lose sight of the ultimate objective.Some people call this approach outcomes over outputs, for example this project around web design that re-scopes based on outcomes not outputs:  Taproot leaders described the system that they wanted to build in terms of its features: It would have a way for volunteers to sign up, a way for volunteers to list their skills, a way for nonprofit organizations to look up volunteers based on these skills, and so on. We were concerned about this feature list. It was a long list, and although each item seemed reasonable, we thought we might be able to deliver more value faster with a smaller set of features.Recognizing &amp; Rejecting Formalized DeliverablesThe key to operating in this fashion is to scrutinize the formalized, named deliverables of your field. Every industry has their own language and concepts for what “deliverables” are expected. This standardization arises from a need for legibility and accountability - they arise because clients need standardized ways of asking for work from agencies, accepting proposals etc. Formalized deliverables however do not always map to where the most value can be created! Consider this list from the SEO industry:  Site audits  Keyword research  Competitive analysis  Link auditsOr this list from the UX design field:  Service blueprint  Consumer journey map  Personas  Ecosystem map  Competitive auditLegible deliverables that everyone agrees to are useful for clients to source bids from agencies, and for agencies to standardize and price work. But for independent consultants your advantage is operating on a different tempo - seeking more agile or alternative ways of working.  Example from my own work. A client engaged with me to do an “SEO audit” of their site (the named deliverable). After spending a few hours poking around it was abundantly clear that the opportunity ahead was convincing the organization to create more content - not from optimizing existing content or fixing technology issues.  After coming to this realization I presented some very small lift technical improvements that we can provide to the product team, outlined a rough back of the envelope market-size for the content opportunity and ran my client through my thinking.  From here the back of the envelope market sizing became slightly more robust and my point of contact and I then called a meeting with the head of the editorial team to discuss ways forward and better understand budgets, expectations and outputs from the content team.  In this example an initial request for a site audit becomes a faster, more iterative project that ends up exploring a business case for content investment - far away from the original ask but still focused on value for the client.Note how in this example we never actually reach the polished deliverable stage - instead there’s a handful of WIP documents, decks and ideas. Depending on the size and formality of the client we might need a formalized content investment case but in this example the client is smaller and we can operate without formalizing into polished documents.Doing Work No One Asked For  - aka Kairos ProjectsIf we double down on the idea of outcomes over outputs, it becomes obvious that there are certain types of work that we should instigate without asking. With the consultant’s unique view of the client (both client-as-organization and client-as-point-of-contact) we have the ability to spot self-directed and useful pieces of work.Kairos projects are things that nobody asked for, but which can be derived from the executives’ outcomes, both personal and organizational.The key, however, is not to sign up for arbitrary deliverables - but rather seek “just in time” WIP versions of the work to provide value and create momentum.Context-less plays often look very little like the formalized “named” deliverables that your industry might expect. Some of the context-less plays I’ve worked on recently:  Building a quick but useful exec-level dashboard in Data Studio  Creating a one-sentence narrative of the objectives of the executive to better communicate and organize the work across teams  Providing a list of 20 candidates on LinkedIn that fit the profile of the VP we’re trying to hireOften this context-less work can feel junior or routine. The key is that we’re focusing on the highest value work right now - oftentimes the key to unlocking momentum and growth is not fancy or difficult, but rather it’s about just doing the right thing at the right time.The key idea is understanding the client’s objectives and anticipating their needsConsider this example where an executive is looking to create a growth marketing team from scratch. The red bubbles are the client’s objectives, and the yellow bubbles are the example “just in time” Kairos projects that you might be able to work on to support those objectives:Juggling Multiple Clients in Kairos TimeConsultants are notorious for spending time embedded inside client organizations (in previous times, physically; now, remotely). This embedded nature can be taxing when it comes to juggling and managing multiple clients at once.When you’re working with senior execs - say the CEO of one company and the CMO of another - neither wants you to be “out of commission” for a few days at a time while you’re on-site with another client.I’ve been in this spot many times and it’s taxing - juggling time on executives calendars is hard at the best of times, let alone juggling executive’s calendars at multiple clients at once.The only way to handle this is by embracing the “just in time” value creation and stealing time from one client for another. But that can only work if the kind of work you’re delivering is fast and small - not large and slow. In short, signing yourself up for Chronos-based deliverables will quickly jam your time capacity - whereas operating on Kairos-based just in time work can be juggled, rearranged and done just-in-time more easily.I’ve lost count of the times I’ve taken a meeting for one client while technically working a full-day for another client. This kind of time splicing is the only way to handle the kind of Kairos effective consulting that I practice.As Venkatesh points out - for clients that know you well, the more valuable a spontaneous conversation can be:Your employee-instincts will balk at the idea of responding to client emails in &lt; 10 minutes. But I use this as the proto example of a “ridiculous expectation” - except it’s exactly the kind of situation you find yourself in a lot as an independent.The trick to responding to clients is not strictly high availability but rather a spider sense of the client’s stress. This enables you to parse in real time how dependent on you the client is.However this cuts both ways. Sometimes you can work a “full day” for a client but have relatively little valuable work to provide, so spend time working on more effective work for other clients - safe in the realization that you’ll do the same for this client when the need arises.This approach is fully decoupling billable hours and clock time from value creation, and frankly can be existentially terrifying (“what are they paying me for?”) but is actually a completely sound approach so long as you’re always returning to your north star:What are my client’s ultimate objectives and what is the most effective thing I can do for the client right now?And being ok with the answer sometimes being: nothing (or very little).This is because there’s a failure mode which is doing too much - disrupting the client’s system too much. Sometimes you need to let the work flow, let the changes propagate, observe, and wait.You can’t take this approach on day one though. You’d ruin your trust. So we need to map out how you transition from clock time to narrative time, from chronos to kairos.Part 3: Steering by Chronos / Steering by KairosIn order to be able to work on kairos time, we need to lay the groundwork and create the right environment. What ingredients are necessary to be able to operate in this way?  Flexible / broad enough scope of work (SOW)  Trust established between client/consultant  A good understanding of your point of contact, their working styles and personality  Enough wider context of the organizationYou likely won’t start an engagement with all these pieces in place. You can’t walk into an engagement and ignore their request for deliverables on day one.However, it is equally true that if you’re still operating in a request -&gt; deliverable mindset six months into an engagement, you’re almost certainly not being as effective and valuable as you could be.So you need to adapt your approach with a client over time. You start off steering by chronos and transition to steering by kairos.Click image to open full size or pinch to zoomEarly engagement: Steering by ChronosIn the original contract, you have to agree on deliverables and outline a timeline:  I will do X by YUnfortunately, at the beginning of the project the client needs, organizational dynamics, and project scope are almost always poorly defined and only map loosely to what the client actually needs and where you’re best placed to offer value.However, it’s important to deliver on your initial deliverables - it’s how you build trust. In parallel however you need to be learning how to work with the organization, merging with their tempo and expanding your contexts so that you can eventually step outside of chronos time.            Doing the work      Expanding your contexts                  Agree to deliverables, meet relevant stakeholders      Understand organizational tempo, understand culture, power dynamics, and the real problems at play, organizational history, calendar weather of execs              Deliver X by Y      Gain wider organizational context              Scheduled meetings &amp; communication      Map out power &amp; status, find alive players              Merge with the organizations chronos tempo - learn how to work within their rhythms      Learn working style of your point of contact      Good questions to reflect on if you’re finding yourself stuck in Chronos time:  Have I met my point of contact’s boss?  Do I understand the top 3-5 priorities for the whole organization?  What are my point of contact’s ambitions?  Is my point of contact above or below the clock line?This beginning engagement can last as short as a few weeks, or as long as six months, depending on how big the client is and how rigid the project is. During this period as a consultant, you’re mostly evaluated on the quality of your deliverables; how well you can deliver against the scope you’re given.The failure mode, meanwhile, is not doing enough during this time to learn about how the organization actually works: mapping power &amp; status &amp; understanding their culture.Eventually however, steering by Chronos and creating deliverable after deliverable will exhaust you - you’re stuck in a world of trying to be effective as a full time employee but with only a fraction of the time.Switching Gears to KairosSwitching gears mid-engagement is hard - the easy thing to do is to settle into established ways of working with your point of contact. But there’s always a way to go deeper.Sometimes the client is working with you to change and focus on value creation over time billed, sometimes they’re actively working against it. Either way, your job is to seek enough organizational context for your work and for your point of contact to be able to see a way to deliver value beyond, around and in-between the defined deliverables.As you spot these opportunities, it’s time to look for ways to cross the clock line and operate on a fast feedback schedule. This might look something like:  “Hey, want to spend an hour working on the board deck together?”  “You know I had a thought about how we talk about this project internally”  “Mind if I show you something I was just sketching out?”You’re basically inviting the client into a more collaborative, working relationship to explore work that sits outside of what a formal deliverable might look like.As you begin to do this - you’ll start to build up a relationship with the client where you can push back on more formalized deliverables:  “Instead of a full site audit let me just review the top priorities for us to discuss with the CPO?”  “Instead of a full customer research project let me talk to a few of the stakeholders across the leadership team and get their perspective and see what knowledge already exists inside the organization?”This kind of reframing of work helps teach the client that you’re focused on ultimate value, momentum, and outcome - not just the output of the deliverable.Late engagement: Steering by KairosOnce you reach the stage of steering by Kairos, there’s no end to how deeply you can play this game, so long as you’re focused on value creation. At this point it’s possible to build a more explicit working relationship designed around Kairos. For example this is where I’ve transitioned to a statement of work that reads “one phone call a week”.Once you’re operating on Kairos time you should be firmly anchored to creating value for your client-as-organization and client-as-individual. Helping the organization reach their goals, helping your point of contact succeed at their career, coaching them on new ways of working etc.At this stage, the consultant is evaluated primarily by how effective they are, beyond deliverables and output.Two examples of this transition from my own work:  Example: operating within a complex organizational structure can slow down your intuition. I was working with a larger organization and had initially agreed to run a brand workshop for each of their 9 sub-brands. This was a fairly large scope of work and a meaty project from the outset. Operating on-site with the client 3 days / week, however, made me feel like I would have a good chance of getting inside the client’s context to shift from deliverables to something more useful.  However - at least 3 months of work was spent running these brand workshops - planning, running, synthesizing, wrapping up. This deliverable-based work trapped me in Chronos time longer than I would have liked - partly because the client had a fairly complicated matrix organizational structure. It wasn’t at all clear who held the power and status inside the organization - with multiple layers of leadership for each of the sub-brands.  Ultimately, although we threw much of the workshop work away it was a necessary phase of work to build trust with my primary point of contact as well build trust across large parts of the organization. I was fortunate enough to throw much of it away and move onto more valuable projects better oriented to delivering value for the client but it’s a good reminder of the challenges of understanding your client’s organization and how it can slow you down.    Example: for smaller clients you can often break out of Chronos time in days not weeks. I was working with a startup a few years ago and we had agreed to a single day workshop to begin the project. This was the scope:    Following this initial day of work not only did I have some trust from the VP marketing, but we also had an agreed view of where value creation would come from. The follow-on scope looked like this:    But - note that all of the legibility and deliverables here are designed for finance gatekeepers. The actual work was already momentum and value based.In both of these examples, it’s the business size and complexity that dictates how quickly you can switch Chronos for Kairos.Wrapping Up  “Jazz is about freedom within discipline” - Dave BrubeckKairos consulting is an attempt to find freedom with discipline - to seek value creation even over adhering to the agreed scope and shape of work. It’s the only way to successfully integrate multiple high-value clients at the same time without reaching burnout.To be clear this Kairos approach is not somehow a way to be lazy on client projects. It’s just orienting your north star to your client’s north star and finding a way to manage your own time in the process.Ultimately, you will find your own tempo and balance of formalized work and improv work - and that’s a good thing. The specific balance and approach will need to fit your own working style, your type of work and your typical client profile. But one thing is clear - getting trapped in clock time is discipline without freedom.            Note that startups often operate on incredibly fast clocks - but there’s still a clock. And recognizing the mismatch between the exec teams clock and the employee clocks is a key idea for resolving tensions and frustrations. &#8617;              There’s a lot of overlap between the concepts of the clock line, above/below the API line from Venkatesh Rao and alive/dead players from Samo Burja that I’ll leave as an exercise for the reader. &#8617;      "

  "date": "December 10, 2020",
  "content": "The biggest challenge independent consultants face is generating new clients. When you sit down and analyze your lead flow it’s hard to draw meaningful conclusions - there aren’t that many leads to begin with so you’ve got a small sample size - and many leads appear to land in your lap “out of thin air” with no obvious way to trace back the source…So how do you generate more leads? In particular - how do you find good leads that are warm and primed for strategic work. In my previous post, Strange Attraction, I talked about the power of your network and why warm leads for strategic work is important:  It’s important for leads to be warm - because it’s hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)  It’s important for leads to be primed for long term strategic work - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you (this helps you get paid well and helps you have a bigger impact) and you want retained work that lasts.Building a resilient and strong network around you is obviously important but in this post I’m going to argue that weak ties are often at work behind the scenes - and that weak ties are where opportunity scales beyond your immediate close network.This works because of two key ideas:  Weak ties are more likely to be a bridge between disparate networks and so scale your reach beyond your strong ties  Weak ties can still make strong intros - not because they care about you but because they gain social capital by making a strong intro.In this post we’ll take a look at some network theory and a classic paper “the strength of weak ties” to examine these ideas and then explore ways to cultivate weak ties in your network.The Cozy Web &amp; Dark LeadsWho recognizes this kind of request - posted in a private Slack group?In this image I’m playing the role of client - fielding a client lead out into a Slack group.A ton of leads flow through these “dark” or “cozy”1 online spaces - Slack groups, discord groups, telegram groups, whatsapp chains, email lists and more. When a client is looking to hire a consultant or agency they first turn to their network, often in a closed space (vs an open space like LinkedIn or Twitter).Let’s call these asks for referrals “dark leads.”As an indie consultant - these “dark leads” are fascinating. It’s a hugely valuable source of leads, but by definition they’re hard to visualize, hard to grasp. Like dark matter, we can feel the gravitational pull of these dark leads but can’t see them.The key to unlocking these dark leads is through understanding our weak ties.The Strength of Weak TiesTo understand the flow of information and connections I went back to the original 1973 paper the strength of weak ties from Mark Granovetter. It’s a foundational paper and reading I was really struck by the core concepts. In essence - your weak ties are deeply valuable. Take this example from the paper:  In a random sample of recent professional, technical, and managerial job changers living in a Boston suburb 16.7% reported that they saw their contact often at the time, 55.6% said occasionally, and 27.8% rarely! The skew is clearly to the weak end of the continuum, suggesting the primacy of structure over motivation.  In many cases, the contact was someone only marginally included in the current network of contacts, such as an old college friend or a former workmate or employer, with whom sporadic contact had been maintained […]  It is remarkable that people receive crucial information from individuals whose very existence they have forgotten.“Suggesting the primacy of structure over motivation” - let’s pause on that. What this is saying is that the shape of your network, the structure of the ties, is more important than the motivation of your strong ties. Said another way, while your strong ties are motivated to help you and actively working on your side they also generally know the same people you do, while it’s your weak ties that are likely to be able to connect you to opportunities outside your core network.This concept of weak ties being powerful is actually not immediately intuitive - the original paper has some light maths but I’d encourage you to read it to get a feel for why this is true. One of the core reasons is because weak ties are more likely to be “bridging ties” - i.e. those that connect you from one group to another group. You can read the whole paper for more detail but in summary “except under unlikely conditions, no strong tie is a bridge” - or said another way, all of your bridges to other groups are weak ties.Look at the following image (from the paper) - where solid lines are strong ties, and dotted lines are weak ties:You can clearly see that there is no possible connection between D and B except via a weak tie.A more modern version of this chart might look something like this - where the only way to traverse these dark/cozy networks is via weak ties (note how the only lines between groups are dotted lines):Let’s return to that Slack request where I’m playing client - on the hunt for a UX designer for a client project:In my search, I posted in two Slack groups I’m part of and pinged two close friends I thought might have good referrals. The above chat with Elan was the one that struck gold - the next day I had an intro to a UX designer (thanks Elan!) who successfully partnered on the project with me.But, from the perspective of the UX designer, it would seem like this client project fell in his lap “out of nowhere” - a “dark lead” that he had no visibility into.Ok, so we know these dark leads operate via weak ties - but it’s still seemingly random. Is there a way to be more intentional? Is there a way to optimize our presence in the network to capture these dark leads? Let’s explore.Dark Leads have limited reach but are rich in social capitalLet’s look at the anatomy of a typical “dark lead.” In the example above it was a 1:1 DM that gained me the intro but in many cases these requests are put into group spaces:This request is in a #referrals slack channel in a group I’m part of with 121 members. There’s two interesting characteristics of dark leads:  Of the 120 people in the channel, it’s very rare for someone to re-share it into their own networks. Unless I have a strong tie with Jenna I’m highly unlikely to risk my social capital and invest time and energy in re-sharing the request. So these dark leads typically have a very low r0 (in 2020’s parlance!). They have a short half-life and don’t get re-shared. Their reach is limited to the immediate audience they’re shared to.  People are motivated to make intros because they gain social capital by doing so. Making a good intro to Jenna raises my social capital both with Jenna and with the group.The idea that these dark leads are rich in social capital - but have limited reach - is why weak ties are so valuable. For this dark lead to reach you, you need a weak tie to be present and able to make an intro - in other words you need to be able to source leads from people you don’t know in places you’re not in.Weak Ties &amp; Strong IntrosSo what does this mean for indie consultants? There are two key insights here:Firstly, you need a network that has reach - not just close ties but rather enough weak ties and adjacent people who you’re connected with that one of those 100 people in the Slack channel can make an intro for you. And they don’t need to like you, because:Secondly, people gain social capital from making good intros. People only gain social capital from making an intro that’s a good fit, and you only gain clients when you get a good client/consultant fit. So you need to educate and explain your work in a way that even weak ties have a good enough understanding of the kind of leads you’d be a good fit for.So what we’re looking for is a large surface area of weak ties - people capable of making a good intro. Remember that weak ties don’t need to like you, they just need to understand your work well enough to be able to make a strong intro (because it accrues them social capital).Cultivating Weak Ties - Why the “1000 true fans” model is unhelpfulIt’s obvious that a strong network and audience helps you gain clients - but often when people think about building an audience and expanding their network, they think of something like the “1000 true fans” model from Kevin Kelly. They believe that building a network of fans - people who are really rooting for you and pay attention to you - will drive clients and strong intros.I see many independent folks building intimate, deep connections with their audience. Tinyletter spaces often feel like this - places to foster deep connections with your audience. And certainly building 1000 true fans and deep connections is powerful and useful! But it’s not the whole picture - in my experience many indie consultants over-index on the smaller stronger network at the expense of cultivating a broader weaker network.The key is to look for balance - to build the kind of online presence that can support BOTH intimate relationships AND a broader surface area to cultivate weak ties.  Example: I cultivate my network in a variety of ways broad and deep. My Tinyletter is a more intimate space while my Twitter profile spans a variety of topics and groups. My discord group is a more intimate, smaller group while my blog reaches all kinds of folks.    For more on this idea see my post on setting up a discord server for my blog.The trend du jour is Substack - and it’s a great model. But I’d argue that many Substacks are about building deeper relationships with a subscriber base - where the goal is to engage a portion of your audience in every email.The difference between Substack and blogging might seem academic but it highlights a key point.Substack is a great way to build an audience and it can be a great way to build 1000 true fans. But the model is optimized for reaching the same audience consistently - not for building new audiences.Blogging, conversely, isn’t designed for building an audience in quite the same way - but is a better tool for reaching new and different audiences each time you publish. When blogging, you can feel more free to roam across subjects, themes and ideas while Substack’s form suggests a tighter and more consistent frame.Neither is right - but the blogging model can be useful for cultivating weak ties. Blogging reaches a slightly different audience each time and that’s a feature not a bug!Ensuring Weak Ties Have a Good Mental Model of your WorkBuilding weak ties however is only one part of the equation - we also need those weak ties to have a good enough mental model of your work that they can make a good intro. Remember - people only accrue social capital from making an intro if it’s a good match, and that requires them to remember you at the right time.Take this example, no offense to the tweeter here, I really love people trying to make intros for me! But this is not a great fit for my current work:Instead, this intro is a note from someone I barely know in a slack group:Note how the intro is primed around the kind of work that I’ve done in the past (audience growth strategy) and they have a reference point from a previous client project. This eventually turned into a client project that was a good fit for my skills.This is the key to ensuring weak ties can make strong intros - ensuring that they have a memetic image of your work in their mind so that they can correctly connect you to the right kind of leads.I use the word memetic here to suggest not only that people need to know clearly what kind of work you do but also that your brand, your image and your work needs to be memorable and designed to be re-shared in response to one of these dark leads.So how do you provide a strong mental model of your work to your weak ties? There are three key ideas:  You need to provide real examples of the work, not just the output  You need to project the right level of seniority  You need to be visible, sustainablyLet’s break those down:1. Show the process, not just the outputA great way to provide a look at your work is to peel back the curtain on your process. To demonstrate what the actual working relationship looks like - not just the output2.That’s why I’m a big fan of thinking in public, it’s a great way to give your network a feel for the actual work, and why I think typically this kind of publishing is more valuable for indie consultants than case studies. Case studies are difficult to produce, limited in scope and tend to overly focus on the results, while thinking in public is an approach that emphasizes sharing as you go, sharing half-finished work and ideas and allows you to roam across disciplines, industries and themes.  Example: my writing about consulting (meta alert!) showcases a bunch of real examples of my work. From recent posts: “working inside an organization attempting a large re-org each VP presented their own budgets and headcount plan to the c-suite” and “I was working with the market leader in a category who was getting complacent with growth” and “working with a media company to overhaul their strategy”Bonus points for describing your work in memorable language. From Strange Attraction:What’s the story here? The lesson is that language is a virus. Design your case studies to be pithy - talk about your work in small fragments that can be repeated in oral culture:“Commerce and content”“Hired a team of 10”“Interim CMO”These short phrases can sum up and signal so much to the right person at the right time - and you can use many of them at once. This is an ongoing project of listening to how people make intros for you - and noting the little phrases they use. How are people understanding and describing your work in the two-line email?@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/2. Project the right seniorityA key ingredient for getting client/consultant fit is finding the right seniority. These days I’m rarely working with anyone below VP-level, and typically working directly with the C-suite. It’s important to project the right signals here to ensure you don’t have a mis-aligned intro even for a project that you might otherwise be a good fit for.  Example: My post about navigating power and status is all about engaging with the VP/C-suite of client organizations. This kind of signaling correctly anchors my audience at the right level of engagement. Testimonials can do this well too - see Andy Raskin’s site that lists a whole bunch of founder/C-suite quotes.Projecting seniority is typically about as straight forward as name-dropping job titles… But there is a sensibility you can project of having a contextual view of a client’s business - see my post the strategic independent for more on the concentric circle of context idea.3. Find a way to sustain visibilityWhile all this theorizing is cute, one of the aspects most correlated with generating leads is simply being visible. Tweeting, posting, commenting, blogging, emailing. It doesn’t matter the medium, humans are hardwired for recency and if you’ve been visible recently you’re more likely to get a referral, especially from your weak ties.This is why building a network can be exhausting - there’s a constant pressure to publish, to promote, to ping. So it’s important to think about ways to build a sustainable way to be visible3.For some nuanced advice on this topic - I love Willa Koerner’s advice in “strategic digital gardening” about creating a digital presence that not only works for your audience but that works for you too. For anyone who feels like networking or blogging makes them want to vomit then this might be for you.Ultimately to find a sustainable way to be visible you’ll need to find your own medium, voice and style that works for you. This can take time to develop so seek some ways to get started in low-risk ways and look to create things that you want to create, not things that you think some abstract audience wants. And it doesn’t need to be writing - if you’re a visual thinker share a figma file or a deck, if you’re improvisational try a vlog or a podcast, if you’re a poet try poetry! You’ll have a lot more success by being sustainably visible in a medium where you feel comfortable than trying to force yourself to create content because you think you should in a way that makes you cringe.ConclusionWhen you first start out as an independent you won’t have a clear vision of the work you do and you’ll inevitably lean hard on your strong ties to generate clients. That’s fine! It’s how it’s supposed to work. But to succeed in building a sustainable practice you’ll need to learn how to cultivate a large surface area of weak ties and create a clear, memorable image of the work you do so that your weak ties can make strong intros.Of course, in practice work will flow through both strong ties and weak ties - I’m 6 years in and run roughly 50/50 for revenue generated through strong ties and weak ties.But perhaps by understanding the power of weak ties we can demystify the “random acts of client work” that come to us and learn how to be more deliberate in building networks that generate client work.            For more on the idea of cozy and dark spaces online see Venkatesh’s writing on the cozy web &#8617;              A key idea related to this is vibe. By working in public, sharing your approach and ideas, not just the finished work you can project a sensibility or vibe - and this can be a key attracting factor. Clients often look for a consultant that they can resonate with and form a working partnership with - this requires a shared sensibility and “way of looking at the world” beyond skills or experience. &#8617;              And don’t forget to close the loop when you do generate referrals via your network. A simple “thank you for the intro, it was a great fit” not only builds good will but also reinforces the memorable image of what a good lead looks like for your contact. &#8617;      "

When you sit down and analyze your lead flow it’s hard to draw meaningful conclusions - there aren’t that many leads to begin with so you’ve got a small sample size - and many leads appear to land in your lap “out of thin air” with no obvious way to trace back the source…So how do you generate more leads? In particular - how do you find good leads that are warm and primed for strategic work. In my previous post, Strange Attraction, I talked about the power of your network and why warm leads for strategic work is important:  It’s important for leads to be warm - because it’s hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)  It’s important for leads to be primed for long term strategic work - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you (this helps you get paid well and helps you have a bigger impact) and you want retained work that lasts.Building a resilient and strong network around you is obviously important but in this post I’m going to argue that weak ties are often at work behind the scenes - and that weak ties are where opportunity scales beyond your immediate close network.This works because of two key ideas:  Weak ties are more likely to be a bridge between disparate networks and so scale your reach beyond your strong ties  Weak ties can still make strong intros - not because they care about you but because they gain social capital by making a strong intro.In this post we’ll take a look at some network theory and a classic paper “the strength of weak ties” to examine these ideas and then explore ways to cultivate weak ties in your network.The Cozy Web &amp; Dark LeadsWho recognizes this kind of request - posted in a private Slack group?In this image I’m playing the role of client - fielding a client lead out into a Slack group.A ton of leads flow through these “dark” or “cozy”1 online spaces - Slack groups, discord groups, telegram groups, whatsapp chains, email lists and more. When a client is looking to hire a consultant or agency they first turn to their network, often in a closed space (vs an open space like LinkedIn or Twitter).Let’s call these asks for referrals “dark leads.”As an indie consultant - these “dark leads” are fascinating. It’s a hugely valuable source of leads, but by definition they’re hard to visualize, hard to grasp. Like dark matter, we can feel the gravitational pull of these dark leads but can’t see them.The key to unlocking these dark leads is through understanding our weak ties.The Strength of Weak TiesTo understand the flow of information and connections I went back to the original 1973 paper the strength of weak ties from Mark Granovetter. It’s a foundational paper and reading I was really struck by the core concepts. In essence - your weak ties are deeply valuable. Take this example from the paper:  In a random sample of recent professional, technical, and managerial job changers living in a Boston suburb 16.7% reported that they saw their contact often at the time, 55.6% said occasionally, and 27.8% rarely! The skew is clearly to the weak end of the continuum, suggesting the primacy of structure over motivation.  In many cases, the contact was someone only marginally included in the current network of contacts, such as an old college friend or a former workmate or employer, with whom sporadic contact had been maintained […]  It is remarkable that people receive crucial information from individuals whose very existence they have forgotten.“Suggesting the primacy of structure over motivation” - let’s pause on that. What this is saying is that the shape of your network, the structure of the ties, is more important than the motivation of your strong ties. Said another way, while your strong ties are motivated to help you and actively working on your side they also generally know the same people you do, while it’s your weak ties that are likely to be able to connect you to opportunities outside your core network.This concept of weak ties being powerful is actually not immediately intuitive - the original paper has some light maths but I’d encourage you to read it to get a feel for why this is true. One of the core reasons is because weak ties are more likely to be “bridging ties” - i.e. those that connect you from one group to another group. You can read the whole paper for more detail but in summary “except under unlikely conditions, no strong tie is a bridge” - or said another way, all of your bridges to other groups are weak ties.Look at the following image (from the paper) - where solid lines are strong ties, and dotted lines are weak ties:You can clearly see that there is no possible connection between D and B except via a weak tie.A more modern version of this chart might look something like this - where the only way to traverse these dark/cozy networks is via weak ties (note how the only lines between groups are dotted lines):Let’s return to that Slack request where I’m playing client - on the hunt for a UX designer for a client project:In my search, I posted in two Slack groups I’m part of and pinged two close friends I thought might have good referrals. The above chat with Elan was the one that struck gold - the next day I had an intro to a UX designer (thanks Elan!) who successfully partnered on the project with me.But, from the perspective of the UX designer, it would seem like this client project fell in his lap “out of nowhere” - a “dark lead” that he had no visibility into.Ok, so we know these dark leads operate via weak ties - but it’s still seemingly random. Is there a way to be more intentional? Is there a way to optimize our presence in the network to capture these dark leads? Let’s explore.Dark Leads have limited reach but are rich in social capitalLet’s look at the anatomy of a typical “dark lead.” In the example above it was a 1:1 DM that gained me the intro but in many cases these requests are put into group spaces:This request is in a #referrals slack channel in a group I’m part of with 121 members. There’s two interesting characteristics of dark leads:  Of the 120 people in the channel, it’s very rare for someone to re-share it into their own networks. Unless I have a strong tie with Jenna I’m highly unlikely to risk my social capital and invest time and energy in re-sharing the request. So these dark leads typically have a very low r0 (in 2020’s parlance!). They have a short half-life and don’t get re-shared. Their reach is limited to the immediate audience they’re shared to.  People are motivated to make intros because they gain social capital by doing so. Making a good intro to Jenna raises my social capital both with Jenna and with the group.The idea that these dark leads are rich in social capital - but have limited reach - is why weak ties are so valuable. For this dark lead to reach you, you need a weak tie to be present and able to make an intro - in other words you need to be able to source leads from people you don’t know in places you’re not in.Weak Ties &amp; Strong IntrosSo what does this mean for indie consultants? There are two key insights here:Firstly, you need a network that has reach - not just close ties but rather enough weak ties and adjacent people who you’re connected with that one of those 100 people in the Slack channel can make an intro for you. And they don’t need to like you, because:Secondly, people gain social capital from making good intros. People only gain social capital from making an intro that’s a good fit, and you only gain clients when you get a good client/consultant fit. So you need to educate and explain your work in a way that even weak ties have a good enough understanding of the kind of leads you’d be a good fit for.So what we’re looking for is a large surface area of weak ties - people capable of making a good intro. Remember that weak ties don’t need to like you, they just need to understand your work well enough to be able to make a strong intro (because it accrues them social capital).Cultivating Weak Ties - Why the “1000 true fans” model is unhelpfulIt’s obvious that a strong network and audience helps you gain clients - but often when people think about building an audience and expanding their network, they think of something like the “1000 true fans” model from Kevin Kelly. They believe that building a network of fans - people who are really rooting for you and pay attention to you - will drive clients and strong intros.I see many independent folks building intimate, deep connections with their audience. Tinyletter spaces often feel like this - places to foster deep connections with your audience. And certainly building 1000 true fans and deep connections is powerful and useful! But it’s not the whole picture - in my experience many indie consultants over-index on the smaller stronger network at the expense of cultivating a broader weaker network.The key is to look for balance - to build the kind of online presence that can support BOTH intimate relationships AND a broader surface area to cultivate weak ties.  Example: I cultivate my network in a variety of ways broad and deep. My Tinyletter is a more intimate space while my Twitter profile spans a variety of topics and groups. My discord group is a more intimate, smaller group while my blog reaches all kinds of folks.    For more on this idea see my post on setting up a discord server for my blog.The trend du jour is Substack - and it’s a great model. But I’d argue that many Substacks are about building deeper relationships with a subscriber base - where the goal is to engage a portion of your audience in every email.The difference between Substack and blogging might seem academic but it highlights a key point.Substack is a great way to build an audience and it can be a great way to build 1000 true fans. But the model is optimized for reaching the same audience consistently - not for building new audiences.Blogging, conversely, isn’t designed for building an audience in quite the same way - but is a better tool for reaching new and different audiences each time you publish. When blogging, you can feel more free to roam across subjects, themes and ideas while Substack’s form suggests a tighter and more consistent frame.Neither is right - but the blogging model can be useful for cultivating weak ties. Blogging reaches a slightly different audience each time and that’s a feature not a bug!Ensuring Weak Ties Have a Good Mental Model of your WorkBuilding weak ties however is only one part of the equation - we also need those weak ties to have a good enough mental model of your work that they can make a good intro. Remember - people only accrue social capital from making an intro if it’s a good match, and that requires them to remember you at the right time.Take this example, no offense to the tweeter here, I really love people trying to make intros for me! But this is not a great fit for my current work:Instead, this intro is a note from someone I barely know in a slack group:Note how the intro is primed around the kind of work that I’ve done in the past (audience growth strategy) and they have a reference point from a previous client project. This eventually turned into a client project that was a good fit for my skills.This is the key to ensuring weak ties can make strong intros - ensuring that they have a memetic image of your work in their mind so that they can correctly connect you to the right kind of leads.I use the word memetic here to suggest not only that people need to know clearly what kind of work you do but also that your brand, your image and your work needs to be memorable and designed to be re-shared in response to one of these dark leads.So how do you provide a strong mental model of your work to your weak ties? There are three key ideas:  You need to provide real examples of the work, not just the output  You need to project the right level of seniority  You need to be visible, sustainablyLet’s break those down:1. Show the process, not just the outputA great way to provide a look at your work is to peel back the curtain on your process. To demonstrate what the actual working relationship looks like - not just the output2.That’s why I’m a big fan of thinking in public, it’s a great way to give your network a feel for the actual work, and why I think typically this kind of publishing is more valuable for indie consultants than case studies. Case studies are difficult to produce, limited in scope and tend to overly focus on the results, while thinking in public is an approach that emphasizes sharing as you go, sharing half-finished work and ideas and allows you to roam across disciplines, industries and themes.  Example: my writing about consulting (meta alert!) showcases a bunch of real examples of my work. From recent posts: “working inside an organization attempting a large re-org each VP presented their own budgets and headcount plan to the c-suite” and “I was working with the market leader in a category who was getting complacent with growth” and “working with a media company to overhaul their strategy”Bonus points for describing your work in memorable language. From Strange Attraction:What’s the story here? The lesson is that language is a virus. Design your case studies to be pithy - talk about your work in small fragments that can be repeated in oral culture:“Commerce and content”“Hired a team of 10”“Interim CMO”These short phrases can sum up and signal so much to the right person at the right time - and you can use many of them at once. This is an ongoing project of listening to how people make intros for you - and noting the little phrases they use. How are people understanding and describing your work in the two-line email?@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/2. Project the right seniorityA key ingredient for getting client/consultant fit is finding the right seniority. These days I’m rarely working with anyone below VP-level, and typically working directly with the C-suite. It’s important to project the right signals here to ensure you don’t have a mis-aligned intro even for a project that you might otherwise be a good fit for.  Example: My post about navigating power and status is all about engaging with the VP/C-suite of client organizations. This kind of signaling correctly anchors my audience at the right level of engagement. Testimonials can do this well too - see Andy Raskin’s site that lists a whole bunch of founder/C-suite quotes.Projecting seniority is typically about as straight forward as name-dropping job titles… But there is a sensibility you can project of having a contextual view of a client’s business - see my post the strategic independent for more on the concentric circle of context idea.3. Find a way to sustain visibilityWhile all this theorizing is cute, one of the aspects most correlated with generating leads is simply being visible. Tweeting, posting, commenting, blogging, emailing. It doesn’t matter the medium, humans are hardwired for recency and if you’ve been visible recently you’re more likely to get a referral, especially from your weak ties.This is why building a network can be exhausting - there’s a constant pressure to publish, to promote, to ping. So it’s important to think about ways to build a sustainable way to be visible3.For some nuanced advice on this topic - I love Willa Koerner’s advice in “strategic digital gardening” about creating a digital presence that not only works for your audience but that works for you too. For anyone who feels like networking or blogging makes them want to vomit then this might be for you.Ultimately to find a sustainable way to be visible you’ll need to find your own medium, voice and style that works for you. This can take time to develop so seek some ways to get started in low-risk ways and look to create things that you want to create, not things that you think some abstract audience wants. And it doesn’t need to be writing - if you’re a visual thinker share a figma file or a deck, if you’re improvisational try a vlog or a podcast, if you’re a poet try poetry! You’ll have a lot more success by being sustainably visible in a medium where you feel comfortable than trying to force yourself to create content because you think you should in a way that makes you cringe.ConclusionWhen you first start out as an independent you won’t have a clear vision of the work you do and you’ll inevitably lean hard on your strong ties to generate clients. That’s fine! It’s how it’s supposed to work. But to succeed in building a sustainable practice you’ll need to learn how to cultivate a large surface area of weak ties and create a clear, memorable image of the work you do so that your weak ties can make strong intros.Of course, in practice work will flow through both strong ties and weak ties - I’m 6 years in and run roughly 50/50 for revenue generated through strong ties and weak ties.But perhaps by understanding the power of weak ties we can demystify the “random acts of client work” that come to us and learn how to be more deliberate in building networks that generate client work.            For more on the idea of cozy and dark spaces online see Venkatesh’s writing on the cozy web &#8617;              A key idea related to this is vibe. By working in public, sharing your approach and ideas, not just the finished work you can project a sensibility or vibe - and this can be a key attracting factor. Clients often look for a consultant that they can resonate with and form a working partnership with - this requires a shared sensibility and “way of looking at the world” beyond skills or experience. &#8617;              And don’t forget to close the loop when you do generate referrals via your network. A simple “thank you for the intro, it was a great fit” not only builds good will but also reinforces the memorable image of what a good lead looks like for your contact. &#8617;      "

  "content": "This is a post celebrating my 6 year indie-versary. 🥳On October 24th 2014 I stepped out into the unknown wilds of independent work and each year I write a recap of the year behind. This year’s post is late because I was not only metaphorically on the road but literally on the road - I’ve been spending 2020 on an extended road trip across the US with my family as a way to make the most of the pandemic situation.I’ve written before about how being independent feels like being on the road so it’s a nice metaphor that we’re spending the year actually on the road…I feel incredibly grateful, humbled and privileged to be able to take off onto the road with my family - to be able to still have work, let alone be able to work from the road. In the mess of 2020 I feel very lucky.Last year the theme was “sustainable independence” - this year I feel like there’s a been a subtle but powerful shift from independence to interdependence. More on that - but first, some reflections on 2020:The Quarantined IndependentClearly the dominating theme for the year was the pandemic and navigating the economy, WFH etc. Throw into the mix the elections and my son Indy being born and it was a wild year full of strange contradictions.I started a blogchain the-quarantined-independent in April to navigate the new world of work exploring:  The challenges of remote consulting and how you navigate context over zoom and slack  What comes after peacetime for indies? and a mental model of convergent / divergent timelines  How Calendly can replace the casual coffee meeting and what it means for new businessOverall as I worked through these challenges - I had one client lose their budget and cut the project short, and one client cancel the contract after signing. But I was mostly just glad to have any work at all during these times. Here’s the story so far:I think the pandemic probably took off 20-30% of this year’s income - and in a heart stopping moment gave me the first month with zero income in over 5 years!Notes from ConsultingAside from navigating the pandemic - some notes and themes from the year’s work:  Even though I had a sharp dip in work when the pandemic started, by late summer it was clear that new clients were out there and work was beginning to reboot. This gave me the confidence to take a real vacation and hit the national parks in Utah/Arizona with the family in October. A magical trip to remember so I’m glad I could do this and feel like there would be work waiting for me when I got back.  I did a project with Google, briefly working in the Google NYC office before lockdown and it was a surreal psychological experience… I thought being back in the Google office as a consultant would be a nice way to exorcise the memories of my time there full time but honestly I just kept glancing at the nooks and crannies of the office where I’d cried when I worked there….  I did some of my best work this year - helping a large client draw up an 8 figure content/SEO investment and then put the plan into practice via org design, hiring and strategy work. I realized that working directly in the SEO sphere again was a unique opportunity to leverage a wide range of skills at the executive level to really be effective.  I did a bunch of work with innovation labs. More on that below but helping clients develop new capabilities is increasingly the only frame I need for the work I do, and this year that meant working in the tech industry and working with innovation labs.  Since being introduced to Figma last year on a project with Toby it’s really dominated my workflow, allowing for new modes of collaboration and new forms of deliverables with clients - creating knowledge work that is not “design” but lives in Figma.Independence vs InterdependenceIf last year was “sustainable independence” this year shifted from independence to interdependence. I wrote recently about the amount of collaboration and partnerships I’ve done this year - it’s been a foundation of my consulting. I wrote about the economic power of the DMs.Not only have I worked on more partnerships in my consulting work but I’ve also built a discord community for indie consultants that has been deeply rewarding and important. We ran a series of salons on topics like:  The indie business model canvas  Thinking in public  What makes a good consulting page  Alumni networks for indiesThank you to everyone who’s been active member of the discord - I’ve really enjoyed the discussion and collaborations. While I’ve been traveling this community has been in prototype phase - watch this space for much more.If you want an invite, DM me.Writing - The BlogBlogging continues to be a continual source of joy, friends, collaborations, clients and creativity Some of my fave posts this year:  Narrative strategy exploring a new hybrid world of storytelling with strategy.  Filtered for… writing inside organizations  Library.json - a proposal for a decentralized GoodReads  And who could forget, Roxy’s first blog post! disaster!In addition to the posts on my own blog I recorded a bunch of podcasts and even wrote a guest post for Venkatesh’s newsletter Art of Gig which I’m very proud of: Sparring as TenureAnd as if blogging wasn’t already important enough to my identity, over the summer Toby Shorin and I built a tool for bloggers called Quotebacks.Writing - The BookWhat with gestures vaguely at 2020… I’ve not progressed quite as much as I’d like with the book but it’s coming! I wrote two posts which are some of my all time faves:  Navigating power &amp; status  The Contrary ConsultantI’ve written roughly 45k words so far in the book - peep the outline and read all the posts so far here.Working title: The Strategic Independent - theory &amp; practice for independent consultants.I have big plans for the book and hope to get the writing done by early 20211.Little FuturesBrian and I re-booted Little Futures for season 2 and shipped 6 more issues. Really proud of this project and this writing:  LF07 - Seamful Futures  LF08 - Embodied Futures  LF09 - Public Futures  LF10 - Permissionless Identities  LF11 - Cohort Futures  LF12 - Permeable OrganizationsWhile we’re still figuring out what Little Futures is exactly - it’s increasingly obvious to me that this is my vehicle for helping companies understand innovation and build and structure teams for doing new things (aka “innovation”)Sign up for season 3 coming soon.So what’s in store for the year ahead?Book + CommunityI’m gonna talk more about this soon but I’m beginning to realize that the way forward for my book is self publishing2 - and bundling the book with a paid community for indie consultants. There’s still a ton to figure out here but I’m excited to really create something of value for other indie consultants.Setting up Innovation TeamsI spent a bunch of time doing work for innovation labs this year - and while I have enjoyed this work it’s clear that there’s an opportunity to help organizations build, structure and organize innovation work. My work across narrative strategy, org design and capacity building feels well suited to this work. So I’m hoping to level up from doing work for innovation labs to helping clients set up innovation labs.This is where Little Futures fits - creating a practice and body of work around how companies organize around for “new”.Narrative StrategyI’ve been writing about the idea of Narrative Strategy in a few places and I’ve yet to write the definitive frame for it but it goes a little something like this (from my last Little Futures):Narrative strategy to negotiate with fractured publicsThis new world of permeable firms with fractured publics require a new kind of corporate comms and a new approach to strategy work. Strategy is no longer a moment in time internal activity - but rather an “always-on” negotiation with these fractured publics to coordinate strategic vision inside and outside the organization. (I’ve been calling this narrative strategy in my own work).For larger organizations - this reframes “corporate comms” as something more essential - the public message increasingly becomes intertwined with the internal strategy. The keynote not only announces the product roadmap, but the product roadmap is shaped by the narrative the keynote can support.For smaller firms and independents - it reframes blogging, working in public and weeknotes as acts of negotiation with a variety of fractured publics, from partners to clients to employees past and future.One could say that we’re moving from a product-first environment to an ecosystem-first environment as per Bob Moore, CEO of Crossbeam:Your place in an ecosystem of tech partners is just as important, if not moreso, than the quality of your product itself. Marc Andreesen was right when he quipped that “software is eating the world.” But in today’s marketplace, ecosystems are eating software.&nbsp;Tom Critchlow https://littlefutures.substack.com/p/lf12-permeable-organizationsI’m increasingly betting on narrative strategy as a way to create alignment between story and strategy. Removing barriers between “internal strategy” and “external comms”. A philosophy of strategy work that is alive and works for the networked age.What else is coming next year? Who knows. But I’m deeply grateful for the friends, partners, collaborators and mentors who have made this all possible and who I’ve crossed paths with out on the road.            Related: I’m terrified of finishing the book, because it’s been such a useful narrative foundation for my consulting journey. Ha. &#8617;              Unless Stripe Publishing wants it 😊 &#8617;      "

Here’s the story so far:I think the pandemic probably took off 20-30% of this year’s income - and in a heart stopping moment gave me the first month with zero income in over 5 years!Notes from ConsultingAside from navigating the pandemic - some notes and themes from the year’s work:  Even though I had a sharp dip in work when the pandemic started, by late summer it was clear that new clients were out there and work was beginning to reboot. This gave me the confidence to take a real vacation and hit the national parks in Utah/Arizona with the family in October. A magical trip to remember so I’m glad I could do this and feel like there would be work waiting for me when I got back.  I did a project with Google, briefly working in the Google NYC office before lockdown and it was a surreal psychological experience… I thought being back in the Google office as a consultant would be a nice way to exorcise the memories of my time there full time but honestly I just kept glancing at the nooks and crannies of the office where I’d cried when I worked there….  I did some of my best work this year - helping a large client draw up an 8 figure content/SEO investment and then put the plan into practice via org design, hiring and strategy work. I realized that working directly in the SEO sphere again was a unique opportunity to leverage a wide range of skills at the executive level to really be effective.  I did a bunch of work with innovation labs. More on that below but helping clients develop new capabilities is increasingly the only frame I need for the work I do, and this year that meant working in the tech industry and working with innovation labs.  Since being introduced to Figma last year on a project with Toby it’s really dominated my workflow, allowing for new modes of collaboration and new forms of deliverables with clients - creating knowledge work that is not “design” but lives in Figma.Independence vs InterdependenceIf last year was “sustainable independence” this year shifted from independence to interdependence. I wrote recently about the amount of collaboration and partnerships I’ve done this year - it’s been a foundation of my consulting. I wrote about the economic power of the DMs.Not only have I worked on more partnerships in my consulting work but I’ve also built a discord community for indie consultants that has been deeply rewarding and important. We ran a series of salons on topics like:  The indie business model canvas  Thinking in public  What makes a good consulting page  Alumni networks for indiesThank you to everyone who’s been active member of the discord - I’ve really enjoyed the discussion and collaborations. While I’ve been traveling this community has been in prototype phase - watch this space for much more.If you want an invite, DM me.Writing - The BlogBlogging continues to be a continual source of joy, friends, collaborations, clients and creativity Some of my fave posts this year:  Narrative strategy exploring a new hybrid world of storytelling with strategy.  Filtered for… writing inside organizations  Library.json - a proposal for a decentralized GoodReads  And who could forget, Roxy’s first blog post! disaster!In addition to the posts on my own blog I recorded a bunch of podcasts and even wrote a guest post for Venkatesh’s newsletter Art of Gig which I’m very proud of: Sparring as TenureAnd as if blogging wasn’t already important enough to my identity, over the summer Toby Shorin and I built a tool for bloggers called Quotebacks.Writing - The BookWhat with gestures vaguely at 2020… I’ve not progressed quite as much as I’d like with the book but it’s coming! I wrote two posts which are some of my all time faves:  Navigating power &amp; status  The Contrary ConsultantI’ve written roughly 45k words so far in the book - peep the outline and read all the posts so far here.Working title: The Strategic Independent - theory &amp; practice for independent consultants.I have big plans for the book and hope to get the writing done by early 20211.Little FuturesBrian and I re-booted Little Futures for season 2 and shipped 6 more issues. Really proud of this project and this writing:  LF07 - Seamful Futures  LF08 - Embodied Futures  LF09 - Public Futures  LF10 - Permissionless Identities  LF11 - Cohort Futures  LF12 - Permeable OrganizationsWhile we’re still figuring out what Little Futures is exactly - it’s increasingly obvious to me that this is my vehicle for helping companies understand innovation and build and structure teams for doing new things (aka “innovation”)Sign up for season 3 coming soon.So what’s in store for the year ahead?Book + CommunityI’m gonna talk more about this soon but I’m beginning to realize that the way forward for my book is self publishing2 - and bundling the book with a paid community for indie consultants. There’s still a ton to figure out here but I’m excited to really create something of value for other indie consultants.Setting up Innovation TeamsI spent a bunch of time doing work for innovation labs this year - and while I have enjoyed this work it’s clear that there’s an opportunity to help organizations build, structure and organize innovation work. My work across narrative strategy, org design and capacity building feels well suited to this work. So I’m hoping to level up from doing work for innovation labs to helping clients set up innovation labs.This is where Little Futures fits - creating a practice and body of work around how companies organize around for “new”.Narrative StrategyI’ve been writing about the idea of Narrative Strategy in a few places and I’ve yet to write the definitive frame for it but it goes a little something like this (from my last Little Futures):Narrative strategy to negotiate with fractured publicsThis new world of permeable firms with fractured publics require a new kind of corporate comms and a new approach to strategy work. Strategy is no longer a moment in time internal activity - but rather an “always-on” negotiation with these fractured publics to coordinate strategic vision inside and outside the organization. (I’ve been calling this narrative strategy in my own work).For larger organizations - this reframes “corporate comms” as something more essential - the public message increasingly becomes intertwined with the internal strategy. The keynote not only announces the product roadmap, but the product roadmap is shaped by the narrative the keynote can support.For smaller firms and independents - it reframes blogging, working in public and weeknotes as acts of negotiation with a variety of fractured publics, from partners to clients to employees past and future.One could say that we’re moving from a product-first environment to an ecosystem-first environment as per Bob Moore, CEO of Crossbeam:Your place in an ecosystem of tech partners is just as important, if not moreso, than the quality of your product itself. Marc Andreesen was right when he quipped that “software is eating the world.” But in today’s marketplace, ecosystems are eating software.&nbsp;Tom Critchlow https://littlefutures.substack.com/p/lf12-permeable-organizationsI’m increasingly betting on narrative strategy as a way to create alignment between story and strategy. Removing barriers between “internal strategy” and “external comms”. A philosophy of strategy work that is alive and works for the networked age.What else is coming next year? Who knows. But I’m deeply grateful for the friends, partners, collaborators and mentors who have made this all possible and who I’ve crossed paths with out on the road.            Related: I’m terrified of finishing the book, because it’s been such a useful narrative foundation for my consulting journey. Ha. &#8617;              Unless Stripe Publishing wants it 😊 &#8617;      "

  "content": "I’ve done more collaborations in 2020 than any other year in my indie consulting career. So far this year:Gig #1 - Worked alongside Erica Heinz on a product R&amp;D sprint. This was the first time working together but we had exposure to each other in a shared Slack group, and had met for a coffee meeting end of last year to share notes and get to know each other.Gig #2 - I pulled in a social media influencer I knew IRL to run some campaigns for a client and potentially also broker a series of influencer deals.Gig #3 - Working for a large company I helped bring in a VP SEO - someone I’d worked with previously. LinkedIn DMs was the medium to broker the deal.Gig #4 - Toby Shorin and I collaborated on a product vision and roadmap project for a client.Two more potential leads are on the table this year that both include collaborations.And I’ve joined the Yak Collective and set up my own !&amp; discord space for indie consultants.Setting up a discord space has been super interesting - there’s a handful of folks active in there who I would now consider “on the bench” if the right project came up - i.e. I have an established communication stream with them and enough of an understanding of the kind of work they do to feel like I can pull them in quickly.Some quick thoughts:  High availability chat channels are key - whether it’s Twitter DMs, Slack groups, discord DMs - the ability to ping someone and engage in real time dialogue is crucial to the kind of “just in time” work that indies do  Familiarity with work is important - what kind of work do they do? How do they work typically? Without some insight here you’re flying blind on labels like “UX Designer” and attempting to guess if they’ll be relevant for this project.  Transparent pricing that goes both ways. Ballpark what do you think they charge for their work? Once you’ve been indie for a while you can typically eyeball this - based on how senior and experienced they appear and what kind of posture they have. Only occasionally am I off here. Every engagement I’m in I’m always open to letting the other party know my rates and fees to create a mutual transparency.  Trust that the person you’re working with isn’t going to ghost you or disappear. This is gained through exposure - either reading someone’s blog, engaging on social or chatting with them in a discord space.These map pretty well to the three kinds of transaction costs that firms reduce:Search and information costs are costs such as in determining that the required good is available on the market, which has the lowest price, etc.Bargaining and decision costs are the costs required to come to an acceptable agreement with the other party to the transaction, drawing up an appropriate contract and so on. In game theory this is analyzed for instance in the game of chicken. On asset markets and in market microstructure, the transaction cost is some function of the distance between the bid and ask.Policing and enforcement costs are the costs of making sure the other party sticks to the terms of the contract, and taking appropriate action (often through the legal system) if this turns out not to be the case. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_costSearch and information costs = high availability DMsBargaining and decision costs = transparent pricing &amp; understanding of what the actual work looks likePolicing and enforcement costs = trust gained through exposure🤔🤔🤔Here’s some links and further riffing around indie consulting collectives, partnerships and collaborations:Theory of FirmFirstly - I think often about this great piece from Matt Webb where he muses on the modern state of Coase’s theory of the firm:Why do companies exist? In The Nature of the Firm (1937), Ronald Coase put it down to transaction costs. In short, companies exist because it’s cheaper to have an organisation that does the necessary activity internally than to use the free market outside it. Why? Because using the market - the price mechanism - itself has costs.Here’s a summary of Coase’s paper:There are costs to using the price mechanism for coordinating economic activity. ‘transaction costs’ or ‘marketing costs’For example, if you want someone to carry your goods from the warehouse to your shop, first you have to find someone. That’s tough. It’s easier when lots of people who need carriage and lots of people who provide carriage come together – on a website or in the Yellow Pages. That’s a marketplace. But at a certain threshold, it’s easier still to just employ those people.Firms exist to economize on the cost of coordinating economic activity.Firms are characterized by the absence of the price mechanism.Matt Webb http://interconnected.org/home/2014/12/23/corporationsThese last two points feel key - when coordinating indie collaborations you need coordination (i.e. open communication channels and ways of working) and the absence of price mechanism. In this instance - the absence of price mechanism is implied as “I can bring indie consultant in on project X and understand how much you will charge (roughly) and share costs transparently so neither of us is gouging the other”.How does this core economic theory change when it comes to indie consultants?Fourth Wave ConsultingVenkatesh Rao writes a very provocative post about “fourth wave consulting” through the framework of “fourth wave coffee”In the fourth wave, which is just over two years old, the indie world is transitioning from individual business nerdery and personal brands/networks to more of a science, and creating a landscape dominated by shared networks rather than individual indie consultants. The Yak Collective is one such network that I’ve helped instigate, one with a focus on pragmatism and delivery, and devoted to consulting as something of an empirical science you can study and get better at through trial and error.Venkatesh Rao https://artofgig.substack.com/people/2264734-venkatesh-raoThis idea is provocative and potentially very early as a trend but not necessarily true per se. The post asks the question - is fourth wave consulting the next wave?Certainly the Yak Collective is interesting - and I’ve seen a lot of benefit from my own discord group. It expands the surface area of indie consultants to open up to each other, show work and broker collaborations (client work or otherwise).A more mature example of this - I’m very impressed by the output from the ResearchOps group: Research Skills Framework.Are these groups actually values based as Venkat describes? Or are loose affiliations and collectives more valuable simply by virtue of creating domestic cozy spaces for indie consultants? The jury is still out on that one.Collaboration &amp; Coordination EnvironmentsEvery project as an independent consultant is a form of collaboration - and I’m still yearning for a good “shared space” computing environment that isn’t Google Docs folders or… email??Every time I start a new client project I pine for a robust notion of &quot;shared digital space&quot; and yet somehow it&#39;s still lacking&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) January 10, 2020I’m definitely intrigued therefore by platforms like Wethos:Wethos builds tools for independent creatives &amp; strategists to team up and make more.Designed for a new wave of entrepreneurs who swap and share projects in real-time, our platform makes it easy to price work, co-pitch services, and transparently pay your partners.&nbsp; https://www.wethos.coCertainly whether it’s 1:1 indie:client or a small group loosely joined we need better shared computing environments that enable the kind of collaboration beyond the document level. I need google docs collaboration across spaces not documents. Wethos seems to be attacking this from the billing pain point.Is there enough of a pain point around shared billing and coordination here for this product? Not sure but I’m paying attention.Teams &amp; CamaraderieReading The Uncertainty Mindset (highly recommended) it was the first time in a long time that I actually missed working in a team. The tight knit working environment, high performance and dance of collaboration. Through the lens of cooking and R&amp;D kitchens Vaughn paints a picture of small, agile, high performing teams able to work together intimately. It’s almost 10 years since I felt like I was working as part of a small highly functioning team (I never got this experience at Google).Certainly 2020 has created the right environment squads as Toby and crew point out:How big is BIG SQUAD ENERGY? Yes, squads are friends empowered by digital tools, but this is much more than new chat apps and online \"community platforms.\" This is the movement. Squaddom is about new ways of being together, learning, and making meaning in an increasingly complex world. Squads are groups fueled by vibes, memes, and values, but they are not mindless swarms. Rather squads are proto-institutions that engage the world on their own terms.Squads are a collective redefinition of value.otherinter.net https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth/Squads clearly create emotional value beyond economic value - to what extent could or should an indie consulting network create squad energy? What emerging forms of camaraderie exist beyond formal teams? Is collaborating with other indies good for the soul as well as good economics?Good bundling and bad bundlingAt the same time I see a lot of newer indie consultants attempting to form brands and mini agency like structures - in particular a key mistake here is grouping together with other indies who do the same work as you. This agency-like structure feels good and enables the creation of shared identity and brand - but doesn’t actually solve the key problem: sourcing good work.Banding together with others who do the same kind of work as you only works when there is an abundance of leads for a certain kind of work. But by far and away the #1 problem indies face is finding good clients. Bundling together with other indies where the work is fungible only creates more overhead. Instead - you should aim to bundle together with folks who can generate adjacent leads and collaborations - the situation where 1 + 1 = 3 as it were.All of my collaborations are with people who do adjacent things I can’t do: UX researchers, product designers, brand strategists.🤔🤔🤔In summary - I’m increasingly realizing the power of the “group DM space” to organize, coordinate and trust other indies.Maybe the key idea is that engaging in collaborations as an indie makes your work more sustainable (both emotionally and economically) and more resilient (by enabling a wider range of work).Thoughts?"

  "content": "A few months ago I wrote up an outline of a spec for a decentralized GoodReads: Library JSON - A Proposal for a Decentralized Goodreads. It had a bunch of interesting replies and comments and I’ve yet to get around to writing a followup.This post is not that followup.But - Sarah Manavis from New Statesman recently interviewed me via email for a piece she wrote about GoodReads. You should read her piece but I thought it was worth posting my replies in full here:Sarah:  Could you tell me a bit about yourself? Where you’re based, professional background, etc (just to explain who you are in the piece)I’m Tom Critchlow, an independent strategy consultant. I’m from the UK originally and been living in Brooklyn for almost a decade with my partner and two kids. I’m a blogger and currently writing a book for independent strategy consultants.Also relevant for this conversation - I launched a books website called 7books (now offline) back in 2010 that had about 6k signups but ultimately never went anywhere but did launch my career in a certain way (this post got a lot of traction and was at the top of Hacker News for a while). So I’ve been circling this books idea for a long time! Screenshot of 7bks website here.Sarah: You wrote the blog of course – but could you explain in slightly more detail why you think Goodreads has been able to hold onto this monopoly?In my mind there’s three core reasons that Goodreads remains dominant:  They are the incumbent with a large user base, ties to Amazon and an incredible amount of SEO traffic  Building a competing product requires a robust books database. Unfortunately there really isn’t a good open database that competes with Amazon’s - so if you want to compete seriously you would be building on top of the Amazon API and that would make me nervous as Amazon has showed no mercy when dealing with competitors before. Open library is likely the best thing you could use for a books database but is certainly not as robust as Amazon’s.  Monetizing books is incredibly hard. Margins on books are razor thin (if not negative!) and almost all the demand goes through Amazon - so again, if you were to compete you would need significant scale before you could either monetize meaningfully and/or rely on Amazon’s affiliate program. Amazon’s affiliate program for books is a small % and again you’d be dealing with Amazon directly…It should be noted - that I think a “better Goodreads” is alluring because reading books and sharing books is an incredibly emotional experience and we try and project and shape our individual identities via books. But! The Goodreads experience for keeping a list of books you’ve read and want to read is actually served pretty well by Goodreads.Most of the imagined features and social ideas are not actually that useful or would never be used often. So many people who dream of disrupting Goodreads focus on the wrong things (myself included!)Sarah: Why do you think Amazon doesn’t invest in making Goodreads better?Feels like the same reason that they don’t invest in making the Kindle better. Amazon I think views both the Kindle and Goodreads as good enough for the core experience (reading, book lists respectively) and sees no real threat so isn’t about to invest behind any major new development.Sarah: What would, in your opinion, a good competitor look like now?There are I think a few viable paths:1) Great polished UX combined with real book community work (reader talks, Q&amp;A, maybe even exclusive releases etc). Basically just a more exciting and culturally relevant Goodreads. Easy to imagine, very hard to build scale.2) Focus on community. Perhaps by starting with a specific niche (e.g. non fiction books, poetry etc) and build a real engaged userbase and then expand from there. Perhaps Literati could build a foundation of community to eventually challenge Goodreads?3) Build some new tools that actually change the reading experience. Something like Highlighter could potentially become this.4) Directly address the unit economics of books. Bookshop.org is attempting to do this through a new affiliate program and direct book purchases. Admirable effort though two problems I see: a) they appear indie but actually are owned by the American Booksellers Association - something they make non obvious to find out. and b) see how much more expensive books are here which makes me think they face a long uphill battle.5) Similar to point 4, perhaps there’s a new economic model for books around the corner.

  "content": "A few months ago I wrote up an outline of a spec for a decentralized GoodReads: Library JSON - A Proposal for a Decentralized Goodreads. It had a bunch of interesting replies and comments and I’ve yet to get around to writing a followup.This post is not that followup.But - Sarah Manavis from New Statesman recently interviewed me via email for a piece she wrote about GoodReads. You should read her piece but I thought it was worth posting my replies in full here:Sarah:  Could you tell me a bit about yourself? Where you’re based, professional background, etc (just to explain who you are in the piece)I’m Tom Critchlow, an independent strategy consultant. I’m from the UK originally and been living in Brooklyn for almost a decade with my partner and two kids. I’m a blogger and currently writing a book for independent strategy consultants.Also relevant for this conversation - I launched a books website called 7books (now offline) back in 2010 that had about 6k signups but ultimately never went anywhere but did launch my career in a certain way (this post got a lot of traction and was at the top of Hacker News for a while). So I’ve been circling this books idea for a long time! Screenshot of 7bks website here.Sarah: You wrote the blog of course – but could you explain in slightly more detail why you think Goodreads has been able to hold onto this monopoly?In my mind there’s three core reasons that Goodreads remains dominant:  They are the incumbent with a large user base, ties to Amazon and an incredible amount of SEO traffic  Building a competing product requires a robust books database. Unfortunately there really isn’t a good open database that competes with Amazon’s - so if you want to compete seriously you would be building on top of the Amazon API and that would make me nervous as Amazon has showed no mercy when dealing with competitors before. Open library is likely the best thing you could use for a books database but is certainly not as robust as Amazon’s.  Monetizing books is incredibly hard. Margins on books are razor thin (if not negative!) and almost all the demand goes through Amazon - so again, if you were to compete you would need significant scale before you could either monetize meaningfully and/or rely on Amazon’s affiliate program. Amazon’s affiliate program for books is a small % and again you’d be dealing with Amazon directly…It should be noted - that I think a “better Goodreads” is alluring because reading books and sharing books is an incredibly emotional experience and we try and project and shape our individual identities via books. But! The Goodreads experience for keeping a list of books you’ve read and want to read is actually served pretty well by Goodreads.Most of the imagined features and social ideas are not actually that useful or would never be used often. So many people who dream of disrupting Goodreads focus on the wrong things (myself included!)Sarah: Why do you think Amazon doesn’t invest in making Goodreads better?Feels like the same reason that they don’t invest in making the Kindle better. Amazon I think views both the Kindle and Goodreads as good enough for the core experience (reading, book lists respectively) and sees no real threat so isn’t about to invest behind any major new development.Sarah: What would, in your opinion, a good competitor look like now?There are I think a few viable paths:1) Great polished UX combined with real book community work (reader talks, Q&amp;A, maybe even exclusive releases etc). Basically just a more exciting and culturally relevant Goodreads. Easy to imagine, very hard to build scale.2) Focus on community. Perhaps by starting with a specific niche (e.g. non fiction books, poetry etc) and build a real engaged userbase and then expand from there. Perhaps Literati could build a foundation of community to eventually challenge Goodreads?3) Build some new tools that actually change the reading experience. Something like Highlighter could potentially become this.4) Directly address the unit economics of books. Bookshop.org is attempting to do this through a new affiliate program and direct book purchases. Admirable effort though two problems I see: a) they appear indie but actually are owned by the American Booksellers Association - something they make non obvious to find out. and b) see how much more expensive books are here which makes me think they face a long uphill battle.5) Similar to point 4, perhaps there’s a new economic model for books around the corner. Substack, patreon etc have unbundled the economics of all kinds of things. Maybe books are next? Maybe some kind of Kickstarter dedicated to books and authors that allows them to build their own distribution? Leanpub is interesting here. Also Craig Mod recently sold his book on a ‘Craigstarter’ model - his own home-built version of a Kickstarter campaign.6) Some kind of decentralized model like my library.json proposal.Sarah: Do you think there ever will be one?I’m sure - though a singular replacement might be the wrong model.

  "date": "August 18, 2020",
  "content": "This is the final piece of the 5-part Yes! And… series exploring the relationship between the theatre of work and the consultant as improv actor. Catch up on chapter 1 here.Many independent workers are outsiders. However, as an indie consultant there’s often a pressure and anxiety to fit in - to step back inside “the system” working within the established processes and rules of the client organization.This pressure to conform causes anxiety for an indie consultant - fitting in directly conflicts with your outsider and solitary nature - and gets magnified when working with high status actors like senior executives, CEOs, investors, and founders.How do you resolve the tension of this duality - of being an outsider on the inside? As an actor outside the system, working to change the client’s systems the key is remembering your purpose:When helping clients do new things, your job is to fight the status quo. New things don’t emerge from fitting in.Even further - in this post I’m going to try and unpack the ways in which you can feel empowered by not fitting in. In fact, the key is to embrace the ways in which pushing back against the status quo and leaning into your outsider status can be rewarding and fulfilling.Remember: when helping clients do new things, their mental models and incentive structures actively work against the change needed. This puts you at odds with the status quo at their organization.And yet, in Optimism as an Operating System I said:  “If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.”So which is it? How do we rail against the system without criticising the client? How do we create a positive environment and at the same time disrupt the status quo?The archetype we’re looking for is the fool:Part 1: The FoolThe fool represents someone outside the system - the archetype of the fool is the court jester, an advisor and confidant to the royal court.In King Lear, the fool has the ear of the king and is the only one capable of telling the truth. In the tarot the Fool card is one of the major arcana and can be either un-numbered, or 0 (low) or 22 (high).The fool is contrary, naive and uneducated -  but at the same time wise and capable of surprise and delight. An outsider, but with the ear of the ruling class.The idea of the jester as a change agent has been explored before - this paper Fooling Around: The Corporate Jester as an Effective Change Agent for Technological Innovation by Tom McMaster, David Wastell and Helle Zinner Henriksen1 has some great observations and draws parallels between key change agent traits and the traits of the jester:So playing the fool can be effective if you’re seeking to drive change - but it’s not just about being effective, I believe the archetype of the fool runs deeper and independents can gain strength and power from playing the fool and not fitting in.The Contrary FoolThe Yes! And… series (start from the beginning with part 1 here) is inspired by the book Impro and here I want to draw inspiration from Keith Johnstone. He has a whole section called “Notes on Myself” where he has a passage on contrariness:  Contrariness  At about the age of nine I decided never to believe any-thing because it was convenient. I began reversing every statement to see if the opposite was also true. This is so much a habit with me that I hardly notice I’m doing it any more. As soon as you put a ‘not’ into an assertion, a whole range of other possibilities opens out-especially in drama, where everything is supposition anyway.  When I began teaching, it was very natural for me to reverse everything my own teachers had done. I got my actors to make faces, insult each other, always to leap before they looked, to scream and shout and misbehave in all sorts of ingenious ways. It was like having a whole tradition of improvisation teaching behind me. In a normal education everything is designed to suppress spontaneity, but I wanted to develop it.As a perpetual outsider this idea of continual questioning, spontaneity and provocation felt true.I re-wrote this contrariness section in my own words focused on my own practice:  The Contrary Consultant  Every consulting engagement starts with reversing the client’s beliefs - challenging every foundational notion to see where there are strongly held beliefs, and where there are inconsistencies. A “not” opens up a problem and reveals all strategy is supposition anyway.  During a consulting project it’s natural for me to misbehave in all sorts of ingenious ways relative to the status quo - to craft alternatives to the existing structures. Normal business operations are designed to suppress spontaneity but I seek to develop it.  I have personally integrated these two archetypes - contrariness from Keith Johnstone and the fool from the tarot - into a personal approach to consulting that seeks surprise, questions over answers and can speak truth to power.This idea of contrary consultant - playing the fool archetype - is helpful because it reminds me that… there is no choice. Indie consultants are often not just outsiders but perpetual outsiders. There’s a value in being contrary - but there’s no way out for perpetual outsiders. We’re often weirdos and oddballs who can’t help but question and poke the status quo… So creating a sense of purpose, identity and acting that “resolves” this tension is deeply important.Let’s take a closer look at themes of the fool: surprise, questioning &amp; speaking truth to power:SurpriseEven though the client has hired you to change their organization - convincing them to change can still be challenging. Organizations are explicitly designed to prevent too much change too fast (even if many employees will deny this and corporate marketing will try to convince you otherwise). Think about how much chaos would be generated if every employee with an idea could act on it…So, in order to convince a client to do something new, you need to be able to surprise them. To bring a client to not just a desire for change but also novel insight that provokes them to take action - to shake them from their status quo.I wrote about interrupting routines to create surprise in chapter 3 - blocking and unblocking clients:This paralyzed reaction to the “make up a story” prompt is exactly the same as many employees and teams when faced with a question of “doing a new thing” (i.e. building a new capacity).Further - employees and teams are heavily incentivized to maintain the status quo. Even if it’s made clear the importance of doing something new their muscle memory is built around maintaining and optimizing the status quo…@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/As weirdos, outsiders and fools we’re often well placed to generate surprise. It can come in the form of new insights about the industry &amp; competitors, it can come from questioning routine assumptions and “the way things are done” or it can come from just doing things in your own way.These surprises are all designed explicitly to generate new momentum and to unblock clients - to demonstrate that there is a way forward when before there seemed none, to create new initiatives from scratch - and they require a healthy disregard for fitting in.Before you can surprise a client, however, you need to find some truth - truths about the situation, about their beliefs, about the project you’re working on. This requires you to take the process of asking questions seriously.QuestionsRemember how naive the fool is. Especially at the start of an engagement it’s key to try and assemble a mental model of the client’s organization from first principles - and the only way to that is through questioning. Questions are one of the most powerful tools you have as a consultant.When you ask a question and the client answers how do you respond?  Beginner consultant: here’s an answer to your problem…  Experienced consultant: here’s some possible answers to your problem…  Advanced consultant: let me ask another question…  Guru consultant: ok, let me ask the same question another way…Don’t take shortcuts or assumptions - start at the beginning.Leaping to the “solution” phase of consulting too soon is a mistake. (In fact many consulting engagements literally never get to the “solution” phase - there’s just a continual cycle of exploration). And further - clients are often pretty bad at describing their own problems2.Questions and inquisition are at the heart of good consulting - you can’t truly know the problem until you understand:  What the client thinks the problem is  What the actual problem might be  How the current system operates  Why the current system caused the problem  Why the current system can’t solve its own problemThis requires a beginner’s mind - and a healthy curiosity. I wrote about this contrary line of questioning in my piece on workshops:Don’t look for smart questions, look for dumb questions.&nbsp;“Ok, this might be a stupid question but why don’t we just build this the way we built the last one?”.My favorite dumb question: “Seems like you have a good handle on the problem and the solution - what do you need me for?”@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/09/23/workshops/Playing the naive fool is perfect for asking “dumb questions” that provoke reaction and surface truths - ideally some truths about the organization, the situation and your point of contact as a human - and allow you to get some insight into “what is really going on here?”Once we’ve assembled some truths and we’ve started some surprising behaviors it’s time to speak truth to power.Speaking Truth to PowerThe unique viewpoint of the consultant - and the unique ability to act as an outsider (and a fool!) provide you as the consultant a special opportunity to say things that people inside the organization might have trouble with.Remember - the fool in the tarot is part of the major arcana but neither high nor low. Often un-numbered. When working in highly political orgs I like to think of myself as the “un-numbered VP” - part of the major arcana but unlike the others.This ability to speak truth to power is a fine line - playing the fool and being an outsider doesn’t automatically give you the right to run your mouth. Instead you still need to carefully size your moments and positions to attempt to shine a light on the truth. Truth is dangerous. But the truth here can unlock great forces of change within an organization.There’s three ways organizations are blind to the truth: blind to the obvious, blind to the outside world and blinded by politics. Let’s unpack them one by one:Blind to the ObviousAs a consultant trying to build new capacities you often end up “strolling across the organization” - meeting many different parts of the business and working with teams and individuals at all levels and departments. When you stroll across the organization you often pick up a pretty complete picture of the organization as it is today without the frame and bias of previous experience, previous activity and history. In short - you get a clear eyed view of what is going on, without any baggage.This allows you to point out things that are “obvious” but that people internally might not want to talk about - or might have conditioned themselves to be blind to.Example: Working with a media company to overhaul their strategy people were looking for big ideas - when the smallest idea was the most powerful. That the content was simply not good enough. People internally were so wrapped up in how the work was made, the process that made it, why it’s made etc that they ceased looking at the output in any objective manner and had abstracted it to reports in spreadsheets. My ability to point out that the output was simply not good and below competitors was helpful and surprising. No one argued that the content was high quality - but it was still a surprise for someone to point it out to them.Blind to the outside worldIn addition to strolling across the client’s organization, as a consultant you stroll across many different organizations as you work with multiple clients. As you stroll across organizations you’re able to bring a little bit of the outside in. Often, when I work with an organization, there’s a team who have been advocating for some change for a long time without success. They feel frustrated and demoralized because of their inability to change the system. Often (not always!) it can be the consultant’s place to dust off the argument and re-frame it with some additional external context that helps executives finally agree to the change3.Example: I was working with the market leader in a category who was getting complacent with growth. A simple survey of satisfaction of their website vs their competitors showed how their market position was under threat. I presented this alongside some internal change agents who had a suite of changes they wanted to lead and helped them gain executive buy-in through a sprinkling of external reality.Blinded by PoliticsThe consultant often holds a very unusual role inside an organization - simultaneously a senior figure and an outsider at the same time. The consultant has no place on the map. Because of this - especially in larger political organizations - it’s possible for the consultant to be able to say things without agenda.Of course, let’s be real, no speech is apolitical and nothing the consultant does is without agenda. But in the eyes of the CEO/board - a consultant can sometimes be seen as less biased than a suite of VPs all jockeying and vying for a small number of SVP spots. The consultant has their own agenda but it’s often orthogonal to the org chart and job title politics that VPs play.In this way - the consultant can have a small voice and a big impact on issues where the organization is otherwise politically deadlocked. 4Example: working inside an organization attempting a large re-org each VP presented their own budgets and headcount plan to the c-suite. Obviously every team pitches for more than they need so the CEO turned to me as a more impartial judge of what teams actually need - not in a formal way but rather in a hallway conversation - I’m a source of “truth” in a highly political situation.Use this speech wisely.&amp;So far we’ve looked at productive, positive versions of the fool archetype - but negative versions abound. Now in part 2 let’s consider some of the potential flaws that come with being a perpetual outsider and weirdo…&amp;Part 2: The Dangerous FoolI’ve spent the last few years actively seeking out and building a peer group of other indie consultants so I’ve seen many different flavors of weird. There are as many different flavors of indie consultants as there are different flavors of rejections that drive us - because to be independent requires a rejection - either the system rejected you or you rejected the system.Some start out weird and get rejected by the system - some get rejected by the system and, untethered from structure, become weird. Either way you develop your own sense of weirdness and eccentricity.From all the indie consultants I’ve met however there is a consistent behavior that can be dangerous - that is holding too tightly to your weirdness and outsider nature.Productively Weird vs Defensively WeirdMany outsiders are distrustful and skeptical of “the system” - almost by definition the system has not worked for them - so they’re skeptical. And further, outsiders are fearful of conforming because it’s seen as the first step on a path to fitting in.So outsiders rebel against the system - they become contrary, surprising and question everything. This is healthy but can be taken too far, this energy can be channeled in unproductive ways and can come across as defensive instead of generative.I think about it like this: when asked to do something that feels like fitting into the system (such as lead weekly standups), I often find myself having defensive reactions and inclinations to distance myself. My knee-jerk reaction rejection and emotions span fear (what if I become just like an employee?), disgust (that’s beneath me) and distrust (do they see me as not capable of surprise?).It’s important to recognize when you are projecting these emotional responses on the client. Examples of this might include “this organization doesn’t have anyone to run standups?” or “these standups are a waste of time” or “I should be doing something more important”. These defenses are a response to the perceived threat of compromising your identity and position as an outsider, your fear of being “taken over” by the organization.The game to play here is to view fitting in as a disruptive act. To enjoy fitting in - the fool masquerading as status quo. The joy of fitting in is understanding how the status quo works to successfully overthrow it.I like to think about this as focusing on generative destruction not defensive destruction. Remember - you’re there to change the client’s organization, but you’re not there to burn it down. And every client organization is likely far more functional than you give it credit for - sure there will be broken, counterproductive and inefficient parts of the system but the system as a whole is more functional than you think.So pick your battles carefully - maybe you don’t want to lead the weekly standup meeting, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should rail against stand up meetings as a practice. Maybe you don’t want to create a weekly report but by doing so you can attend the weekly executive meeting.Forming a complete and integrated self identity is hard work and takes time (and by the way is something no one ever tells you when you start out on your own). I’ve written about this before in my piece I, consultant - but the gist is this: if you can find an identity you’re comfortable with you’ll feel safer making “insider transgressions” - i.e. fitting in at times. And often you’ll find that your assumptions about fitting in was flawed in the first place.It’s important to look in the mirror and attempt to clearly see the client and your own behavior in context. In chapter 3 I claimed that often you’re the one blocking the client:All of this talk of blocked clients however misses something important - in my own work, 80% of the time when you feel the client is blocked - it is you the consultant that is blocking the client!The consultant’s ego places a high value on your own ideas - you want to be the hero that has the “right” answers. And in fact you can feel like a fraud if you work on a consulting project where you don’t have any original ideas.This thinking will lead you into trouble.@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/So tread carefully, question the ego and seek to develop a strong sense of identity. Swallow your pride and seek ways of generative destruction not defensive destruction.Remember: your outsider identity gives you energy and drive but can be taken too far.You have to be careful not to fit in for too long though….The Dangerous Fool: Outsider or Outcast?The fear of the fool is to be an outcast. To transition from outsider to outcast (or worse to clueless). To be an outcast is to be an outsider that isn’t allowed in. For a free player consultant (vs a process consultant see definition) we’ve explored the winning move of surprise, but there are two losing moves:  Fitting in for too long. Through fitting in and following the rules for too long we lose our outsider status and lose the ability to surprise our client. This path leads to employee-dom.  Being boring. Even if we don’t follow the rules and fit in - if we fail to bring surprise then we become boring for our point of contact. This path leads to being marginalized and ignored - an outcast.We can visualize this map in a 2x2  (drawn from the perspective of the free-player consultant or fool):Becoming clueless - i.e. an insider incapable of surprise - is bad, but worse is being an outcast. The fear for indie consultants who are trying to “stay alive” (in the samo burja sense of live players and dead players) is becoming an outcast - being fully and completely rejected not just by one organization but by all organizations.When client work dries up I feel this existential terror. Have I stopped being able to surprise clients?The way through this is to recognize surprise as a core part of your identity - to be weird in ways that bring delight to clients. To prance, dance and perform for clients in ways that test boundaries, that explore new territory and question assumptions but without being rejected wholesale and becoming an outcast.ConclusionRecognizing and developing a sense of identity that is true and strong as an indie consultant is hard. It’s a long road. I hope this Yes! And… series has given some hope for those wrestling with organizations - attempting to change them, to see them, to work with them without falling into clueless or outcast status. To be effective and playful.I sent a draft of this piece to an old client and she said this:  “Sending these over in case it sparks something….  Humor, Humility, and Humanity  These are words that come to mind when I hear “wink and a chuckle”. Initially I think Santa Clause and his deep belly laugh. I ask: “How does one discover or sustain childlike wonder in the workplace? How do we find humor when stakes are high and serious means business?

  "content": "This is the final piece of the 5-part Yes! And… series exploring the relationship between the theatre of work and the consultant as improv actor. Catch up on chapter 1 here.Many independent workers are outsiders. However, as an indie consultant there’s often a pressure and anxiety to fit in - to step back inside “the system” working within the established processes and rules of the client organization.This pressure to conform causes anxiety for an indie consultant - fitting in directly conflicts with your outsider and solitary nature - and gets magnified when working with high status actors like senior executives, CEOs, investors, and founders.How do you resolve the tension of this duality - of being an outsider on the inside? As an actor outside the system, working to change the client’s systems the key is remembering your purpose:When helping clients do new things, your job is to fight the status quo. New things don’t emerge from fitting in.Even further - in this post I’m going to try and unpack the ways in which you can feel empowered by not fitting in. In fact, the key is to embrace the ways in which pushing back against the status quo and leaning into your outsider status can be rewarding and fulfilling.Remember: when helping clients do new things, their mental models and incentive structures actively work against the change needed. This puts you at odds with the status quo at their organization.And yet, in Optimism as an Operating System I said:  “If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.”So which is it? How do we rail against the system without criticising the client? How do we create a positive environment and at the same time disrupt the status quo?The archetype we’re looking for is the fool:Part 1: The FoolThe fool represents someone outside the system - the archetype of the fool is the court jester, an advisor and confidant to the royal court.In King Lear, the fool has the ear of the king and is the only one capable of telling the truth. In the tarot the Fool card is one of the major arcana and can be either un-numbered, or 0 (low) or 22 (high).The fool is contrary, naive and uneducated -  but at the same time wise and capable of surprise and delight. An outsider, but with the ear of the ruling class.The idea of the jester as a change agent has been explored before - this paper Fooling Around: The Corporate Jester as an Effective Change Agent for Technological Innovation by Tom McMaster, David Wastell and Helle Zinner Henriksen1 has some great observations and draws parallels between key change agent traits and the traits of the jester:So playing the fool can be effective if you’re seeking to drive change - but it’s not just about being effective, I believe the archetype of the fool runs deeper and independents can gain strength and power from playing the fool and not fitting in.The Contrary FoolThe Yes! And… series (start from the beginning with part 1 here) is inspired by the book Impro and here I want to draw inspiration from Keith Johnstone. He has a whole section called “Notes on Myself” where he has a passage on contrariness:  Contrariness  At about the age of nine I decided never to believe any-thing because it was convenient. I began reversing every statement to see if the opposite was also true. This is so much a habit with me that I hardly notice I’m doing it any more. As soon as you put a ‘not’ into an assertion, a whole range of other possibilities opens out-especially in drama, where everything is supposition anyway.  When I began teaching, it was very natural for me to reverse everything my own teachers had done. I got my actors to make faces, insult each other, always to leap before they looked, to scream and shout and misbehave in all sorts of ingenious ways. It was like having a whole tradition of improvisation teaching behind me. In a normal education everything is designed to suppress spontaneity, but I wanted to develop it.As a perpetual outsider this idea of continual questioning, spontaneity and provocation felt true.I re-wrote this contrariness section in my own words focused on my own practice:  The Contrary Consultant  Every consulting engagement starts with reversing the client’s beliefs - challenging every foundational notion to see where there are strongly held beliefs, and where there are inconsistencies. A “not” opens up a problem and reveals all strategy is supposition anyway.  During a consulting project it’s natural for me to misbehave in all sorts of ingenious ways relative to the status quo - to craft alternatives to the existing structures. Normal business operations are designed to suppress spontaneity but I seek to develop it.  I have personally integrated these two archetypes - contrariness from Keith Johnstone and the fool from the tarot - into a personal approach to consulting that seeks surprise, questions over answers and can speak truth to power.This idea of contrary consultant - playing the fool archetype - is helpful because it reminds me that… there is no choice. Indie consultants are often not just outsiders but perpetual outsiders. There’s a value in being contrary - but there’s no way out for perpetual outsiders. We’re often weirdos and oddballs who can’t help but question and poke the status quo… So creating a sense of purpose, identity and acting that “resolves” this tension is deeply important.Let’s take a closer look at themes of the fool: surprise, questioning &amp; speaking truth to power:SurpriseEven though the client has hired you to change their organization - convincing them to change can still be challenging. Organizations are explicitly designed to prevent too much change too fast (even if many employees will deny this and corporate marketing will try to convince you otherwise). Think about how much chaos would be generated if every employee with an idea could act on it…So, in order to convince a client to do something new, you need to be able to surprise them. To bring a client to not just a desire for change but also novel insight that provokes them to take action - to shake them from their status quo.I wrote about interrupting routines to create surprise in chapter 3 - blocking and unblocking clients:This paralyzed reaction to the “make up a story” prompt is exactly the same as many employees and teams when faced with a question of “doing a new thing” (i.e. building a new capacity).Further - employees and teams are heavily incentivized to maintain the status quo. Even if it’s made clear the importance of doing something new their muscle memory is built around maintaining and optimizing the status quo…@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/As weirdos, outsiders and fools we’re often well placed to generate surprise. It can come in the form of new insights about the industry &amp; competitors, it can come from questioning routine assumptions and “the way things are done” or it can come from just doing things in your own way.These surprises are all designed explicitly to generate new momentum and to unblock clients - to demonstrate that there is a way forward when before there seemed none, to create new initiatives from scratch - and they require a healthy disregard for fitting in.Before you can surprise a client, however, you need to find some truth - truths about the situation, about their beliefs, about the project you’re working on. This requires you to take the process of asking questions seriously.QuestionsRemember how naive the fool is. Especially at the start of an engagement it’s key to try and assemble a mental model of the client’s organization from first principles - and the only way to that is through questioning. Questions are one of the most powerful tools you have as a consultant.When you ask a question and the client answers how do you respond?  Beginner consultant: here’s an answer to your problem…  Experienced consultant: here’s some possible answers to your problem…  Advanced consultant: let me ask another question…  Guru consultant: ok, let me ask the same question another way…Don’t take shortcuts or assumptions - start at the beginning.Leaping to the “solution” phase of consulting too soon is a mistake. (In fact many consulting engagements literally never get to the “solution” phase - there’s just a continual cycle of exploration). And further - clients are often pretty bad at describing their own problems2.Questions and inquisition are at the heart of good consulting - you can’t truly know the problem until you understand:  What the client thinks the problem is  What the actual problem might be  How the current system operates  Why the current system caused the problem  Why the current system can’t solve its own problemThis requires a beginner’s mind - and a healthy curiosity. I wrote about this contrary line of questioning in my piece on workshops:Don’t look for smart questions, look for dumb questions.&nbsp;“Ok, this might be a stupid question but why don’t we just build this the way we built the last one?”.My favorite dumb question: “Seems like you have a good handle on the problem and the solution - what do you need me for?”@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/09/23/workshops/Playing the naive fool is perfect for asking “dumb questions” that provoke reaction and surface truths - ideally some truths about the organization, the situation and your point of contact as a human - and allow you to get some insight into “what is really going on here?”Once we’ve assembled some truths and we’ve started some surprising behaviors it’s time to speak truth to power.Speaking Truth to PowerThe unique viewpoint of the consultant - and the unique ability to act as an outsider (and a fool!) provide you as the consultant a special opportunity to say things that people inside the organization might have trouble with.Remember - the fool in the tarot is part of the major arcana but neither high nor low. Often un-numbered. When working in highly political orgs I like to think of myself as the “un-numbered VP” - part of the major arcana but unlike the others.This ability to speak truth to power is a fine line - playing the fool and being an outsider doesn’t automatically give you the right to run your mouth. Instead you still need to carefully size your moments and positions to attempt to shine a light on the truth. Truth is dangerous. But the truth here can unlock great forces of change within an organization.There’s three ways organizations are blind to the truth: blind to the obvious, blind to the outside world and blinded by politics. Let’s unpack them one by one:Blind to the ObviousAs a consultant trying to build new capacities you often end up “strolling across the organization” - meeting many different parts of the business and working with teams and individuals at all levels and departments. When you stroll across the organization you often pick up a pretty complete picture of the organization as it is today without the frame and bias of previous experience, previous activity and history. In short - you get a clear eyed view of what is going on, without any baggage.This allows you to point out things that are “obvious” but that people internally might not want to talk about - or might have conditioned themselves to be blind to.Example: Working with a media company to overhaul their strategy people were looking for big ideas - when the smallest idea was the most powerful. That the content was simply not good enough. People internally were so wrapped up in how the work was made, the process that made it, why it’s made etc that they ceased looking at the output in any objective manner and had abstracted it to reports in spreadsheets. My ability to point out that the output was simply not good and below competitors was helpful and surprising. No one argued that the content was high quality - but it was still a surprise for someone to point it out to them.Blind to the outside worldIn addition to strolling across the client’s organization, as a consultant you stroll across many different organizations as you work with multiple clients. As you stroll across organizations you’re able to bring a little bit of the outside in. Often, when I work with an organization, there’s a team who have been advocating for some change for a long time without success. They feel frustrated and demoralized because of their inability to change the system. Often (not always!) it can be the consultant’s place to dust off the argument and re-frame it with some additional external context that helps executives finally agree to the change3.Example: I was working with the market leader in a category who was getting complacent with growth. A simple survey of satisfaction of their website vs their competitors showed how their market position was under threat. I presented this alongside some internal change agents who had a suite of changes they wanted to lead and helped them gain executive buy-in through a sprinkling of external reality.Blinded by PoliticsThe consultant often holds a very unusual role inside an organization - simultaneously a senior figure and an outsider at the same time. The consultant has no place on the map. Because of this - especially in larger political organizations - it’s possible for the consultant to be able to say things without agenda.Of course, let’s be real, no speech is apolitical and nothing the consultant does is without agenda. But in the eyes of the CEO/board - a consultant can sometimes be seen as less biased than a suite of VPs all jockeying and vying for a small number of SVP spots. The consultant has their own agenda but it’s often orthogonal to the org chart and job title politics that VPs play.In this way - the consultant can have a small voice and a big impact on issues where the organization is otherwise politically deadlocked. 4Example: working inside an organization attempting a large re-org each VP presented their own budgets and headcount plan to the c-suite. Obviously every team pitches for more than they need so the CEO turned to me as a more impartial judge of what teams actually need - not in a formal way but rather in a hallway conversation - I’m a source of “truth” in a highly political situation.Use this speech wisely.&amp;So far we’ve looked at productive, positive versions of the fool archetype - but negative versions abound. Now in part 2 let’s consider some of the potential flaws that come with being a perpetual outsider and weirdo…&amp;Part 2: The Dangerous FoolI’ve spent the last few years actively seeking out and building a peer group of other indie consultants so I’ve seen many different flavors of weird. There are as many different flavors of indie consultants as there are different flavors of rejections that drive us - because to be independent requires a rejection - either the system rejected you or you rejected the system.Some start out weird and get rejected by the system - some get rejected by the system and, untethered from structure, become weird. Either way you develop your own sense of weirdness and eccentricity.From all the indie consultants I’ve met however there is a consistent behavior that can be dangerous - that is holding too tightly to your weirdness and outsider nature.Productively Weird vs Defensively WeirdMany outsiders are distrustful and skeptical of “the system” - almost by definition the system has not worked for them - so they’re skeptical. And further, outsiders are fearful of conforming because it’s seen as the first step on a path to fitting in.So outsiders rebel against the system - they become contrary, surprising and question everything. This is healthy but can be taken too far, this energy can be channeled in unproductive ways and can come across as defensive instead of generative.I think about it like this: when asked to do something that feels like fitting into the system (such as lead weekly standups), I often find myself having defensive reactions and inclinations to distance myself. My knee-jerk reaction rejection and emotions span fear (what if I become just like an employee?), disgust (that’s beneath me) and distrust (do they see me as not capable of surprise?).It’s important to recognize when you are projecting these emotional responses on the client. Examples of this might include “this organization doesn’t have anyone to run standups?” or “these standups are a waste of time” or “I should be doing something more important”. These defenses are a response to the perceived threat of compromising your identity and position as an outsider, your fear of being “taken over” by the organization.The game to play here is to view fitting in as a disruptive act. To enjoy fitting in - the fool masquerading as status quo. The joy of fitting in is understanding how the status quo works to successfully overthrow it.I like to think about this as focusing on generative destruction not defensive destruction. Remember - you’re there to change the client’s organization, but you’re not there to burn it down. And every client organization is likely far more functional than you give it credit for - sure there will be broken, counterproductive and inefficient parts of the system but the system as a whole is more functional than you think.So pick your battles carefully - maybe you don’t want to lead the weekly standup meeting, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should rail against stand up meetings as a practice. Maybe you don’t want to create a weekly report but by doing so you can attend the weekly executive meeting.Forming a complete and integrated self identity is hard work and takes time (and by the way is something no one ever tells you when you start out on your own). I’ve written about this before in my piece I, consultant - but the gist is this: if you can find an identity you’re comfortable with you’ll feel safer making “insider transgressions” - i.e. fitting in at times. And often you’ll find that your assumptions about fitting in was flawed in the first place.It’s important to look in the mirror and attempt to clearly see the client and your own behavior in context. In chapter 3 I claimed that often you’re the one blocking the client:All of this talk of blocked clients however misses something important - in my own work, 80% of the time when you feel the client is blocked - it is you the consultant that is blocking the client!The consultant’s ego places a high value on your own ideas - you want to be the hero that has the “right” answers. And in fact you can feel like a fraud if you work on a consulting project where you don’t have any original ideas.This thinking will lead you into trouble.@tomcritchlow https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/So tread carefully, question the ego and seek to develop a strong sense of identity. Swallow your pride and seek ways of generative destruction not defensive destruction.Remember: your outsider identity gives you energy and drive but can be taken too far.You have to be careful not to fit in for too long though….The Dangerous Fool: Outsider or Outcast?The fear of the fool is to be an outcast. To transition from outsider to outcast (or worse to clueless). To be an outcast is to be an outsider that isn’t allowed in. For a free player consultant (vs a process consultant see definition) we’ve explored the winning move of surprise, but there are two losing moves:  Fitting in for too long. Through fitting in and following the rules for too long we lose our outsider status and lose the ability to surprise our client. This path leads to employee-dom.  Being boring. Even if we don’t follow the rules and fit in - if we fail to bring surprise then we become boring for our point of contact. This path leads to being marginalized and ignored - an outcast.We can visualize this map in a 2x2  (drawn from the perspective of the free-player consultant or fool):Becoming clueless - i.e. an insider incapable of surprise - is bad, but worse is being an outcast. The fear for indie consultants who are trying to “stay alive” (in the samo burja sense of live players and dead players) is becoming an outcast - being fully and completely rejected not just by one organization but by all organizations.When client work dries up I feel this existential terror. Have I stopped being able to surprise clients?The way through this is to recognize surprise as a core part of your identity - to be weird in ways that bring delight to clients. To prance, dance and perform for clients in ways that test boundaries, that explore new territory and question assumptions but without being rejected wholesale and becoming an outcast.ConclusionRecognizing and developing a sense of identity that is true and strong as an indie consultant is hard. It’s a long road. I hope this Yes! And… series has given some hope for those wrestling with organizations - attempting to change them, to see them, to work with them without falling into clueless or outcast status. To be effective and playful.I sent a draft of this piece to an old client and she said this:  “Sending these over in case it sparks something….  Humor, Humility, and Humanity  These are words that come to mind when I hear “wink and a chuckle”. Initially I think Santa Clause and his deep belly laugh. I ask: “How does one discover or sustain childlike wonder in the workplace? How do we find humor when stakes are high and serious means business? How do we find humility in a world that has historically rewarded hubris?”Rather than try and integrate this comment into the essay I want to leave it as is.

  "date": "August 6, 2020",
  "content": "A few indie consultants convened in the !&amp; discord space recently to discuss the topic of “small group consulting”. We were inspired by a range of interesting readings:  Learning Communities of Place: Situating Learning Towns Within A Nested Concept of Social Learning Environments (pdf)  Small groups and consultancy and coffee mornings (interconnected.org)  Improving Management with Individual and Group-Based Consulting (pdf)  The Importance of Sharing Experiences (theatlantic.com)We touched on many themes and ideas - initially excited to explore small group consultancy in the context of one consultant gathering multiple clients together we quickly realized that alumni networks play a key role in indie consulting:The Power of Alumni NetworksI was shocked when I actually ran the numbers recently:40% of my consulting revenue has come from Distilled alumni.Ok I knew this number was high but that number surprised even me. My brother’s company that I used to work at Distilled&nbsp;has been a significant source of leads. This is not referrals from Distilled - none of these leads came as “official” referrals from Distilled the agency, but rather introductions from Distilled alumni who have spread far and wide and now lead lots of fascinating work across many different agencies, consulting practices and more.So, for me Distilled has functioned like an institution. I imagine this is the power people talk about of the kind of network you get doing an MBA etc.Perhaps there’s something to be learned from building institutions. How might you do that? What would it look like?tomcritchlow.com https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/26/unbundling-nyc-calendly/And this was validated via discussions with other indie consultants - alumni networks have been powerful forces for generating client work.Why is that? We posited:  Alumni networks provide shared experience and actual work environments for people to build trust and working relationships  Crucially however, alumni networks are diverse. Your colleagues at a company span different departments and skillsWhat this alumni network makes is a set of people who you trust and who deeply understand your skills. They are typically not competing with you for work and are motivated to make warm intros and able to spot situations where you’ll be a good fit.My friend Brian Dell put together this sketch of a 2x2 to outline where and how alumni networks are valuable:Mmm. Lots to noodle on here.The Mistake Indies MakeThe mistake many indies make is to band together with people who do work like them. A set of three strategists clubbing together to build a virtual agency - the theory goes that you can “act bigger than you are” to get bigger clients. Unfortunately this strategy is inherently flawed - most indies don’t have trouble closing business, they have trouble generating leads.In fact you could say that the defining challenge of an indie consultant is generating clients.Let’s illustrate with an example:Let’s say 3 indie strategists club together to form a virtual agency. Let’s say each gets 10 strategy client leads a year. So now they have 30 leads a year but 3x the mouths to feed. Yes they might be able to collaborate on work and so on but nothing really has changed.Instead consider an example where indies club together with differing skillsets:Let’s say an indie developer and an indie writer club together. If the indie developer has 10 developer leads a year (that they can service) and 2 writing leads a year (that they can’t service), while the writer has 10 writing leads a year (that they service) and 3 developer leads a year (which they can’t service) - now instead of 10 leads each a year they have 12 and 13 leads a year.This dumb example highlights the importance of aligning yourself with people who have leads you need but can’t service.Career development for indie consultantsInterestingly - indie consultants are hungry for professional development:The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of managing your own labels.

  "content": "A few indie consultants convened in the !&amp; discord space recently to discuss the topic of “small group consulting”. We were inspired by a range of interesting readings:  Learning Communities of Place: Situating Learning Towns Within A Nested Concept of Social Learning Environments (pdf)  Small groups and consultancy and coffee mornings (interconnected.org)  Improving Management with Individual and Group-Based Consulting (pdf)  The Importance of Sharing Experiences (theatlantic.com)We touched on many themes and ideas - initially excited to explore small group consultancy in the context of one consultant gathering multiple clients together we quickly realized that alumni networks play a key role in indie consulting:The Power of Alumni NetworksI was shocked when I actually ran the numbers recently:40% of my consulting revenue has come from Distilled alumni.Ok I knew this number was high but that number surprised even me. My brother’s company that I used to work at Distilled&nbsp;has been a significant source of leads. This is not referrals from Distilled - none of these leads came as “official” referrals from Distilled the agency, but rather introductions from Distilled alumni who have spread far and wide and now lead lots of fascinating work across many different agencies, consulting practices and more.So, for me Distilled has functioned like an institution. I imagine this is the power people talk about of the kind of network you get doing an MBA etc.Perhaps there’s something to be learned from building institutions. How might you do that? What would it look like?tomcritchlow.com https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/26/unbundling-nyc-calendly/And this was validated via discussions with other indie consultants - alumni networks have been powerful forces for generating client work.Why is that? We posited:  Alumni networks provide shared experience and actual work environments for people to build trust and working relationships  Crucially however, alumni networks are diverse. Your colleagues at a company span different departments and skillsWhat this alumni network makes is a set of people who you trust and who deeply understand your skills. They are typically not competing with you for work and are motivated to make warm intros and able to spot situations where you’ll be a good fit.My friend Brian Dell put together this sketch of a 2x2 to outline where and how alumni networks are valuable:Mmm. Lots to noodle on here.The Mistake Indies MakeThe mistake many indies make is to band together with people who do work like them. A set of three strategists clubbing together to build a virtual agency - the theory goes that you can “act bigger than you are” to get bigger clients. Unfortunately this strategy is inherently flawed - most indies don’t have trouble closing business, they have trouble generating leads.In fact you could say that the defining challenge of an indie consultant is generating clients.Let’s illustrate with an example:Let’s say 3 indie strategists club together to form a virtual agency. Let’s say each gets 10 strategy client leads a year. So now they have 30 leads a year but 3x the mouths to feed. Yes they might be able to collaborate on work and so on but nothing really has changed.Instead consider an example where indies club together with differing skillsets:Let’s say an indie developer and an indie writer club together. If the indie developer has 10 developer leads a year (that they can service) and 2 writing leads a year (that they can’t service), while the writer has 10 writing leads a year (that they service) and 3 developer leads a year (which they can’t service) - now instead of 10 leads each a year they have 12 and 13 leads a year.This dumb example highlights the importance of aligning yourself with people who have leads you need but can’t service.Career development for indie consultantsInterestingly - indie consultants are hungry for professional development:The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of managing your own labels.

  "date": "July 8, 2020",
  "content": "I’m interested in new ways of creating conversation and discussion online. Quotebacks is a kind of attempt at encouraging cross-blog conversation. But in reality if we think of this blog as my “home” on the web - then conversation happens in a variety of spaces, but mostly on twitter.But Twitter comments are of a particular type (the medium is the message!) - and are open by default. Increasingly I’m interested in slightly deeper conversations - the kind of things that happen in twitter DMs or over email. But these are often 1:1 - where many of them would be much more interesting as small group discussions.So if my blog is one “space” and twitter is another “space” - what new spaces might exist?  Twitter: A realtime fully public commons  Website: A fully public but slower space  Tinyletter: A cozy space but a slower pace  Discord: A semi-public space for realtime conversationDiscord - a Realtime Cozy Chat SpaceI’ve set up a “tomcritchlow” discord space1. I’m planning on using it for:  Longer/deeper discussions triggered from my blog or twitter (“take it to the discord!” instead of “take it to the DMs!”).  A more persistent space for people who want to review blog post drafts  A space to host real-time sessionsThe plan is for this space to be fairly small, fairly quiet and more intimate than my public blog/twitter spaces. It looks like this:I anticipate only a handful of active users at once and the number of channels is going to be limited. For now there’s discussion for:  #cafe: Casual chat and conversation  #introductions: Introduce yourself!  #indie-consulting: Chatting all things indie consulting  #blogging: Chatting all things blogs  #tomcritchlow-rss: RSS will auto-post blog posts hereThe First Open Discord Session: Thinking in PublicI’m going to run an open session next Tuesday (14th July) at 1pm EST on the topic of Thinking in Public.Hopefully this will be useful for:  Bloggers who are stuck  People who want to start blogging  Agencies interested in “content marketing” that doesn’t suck  Fans of the blog!The format is going to be discord voice channel + a figma file. We’re gonna jam live!Discord’s FutureLet’s not call it a community. Discord feels more like a space than a community - there’s no user accounts (you make a discord account not a tomcritchlow-discord account). And increasingly the open social spaces like twitter are fragmenting into smaller semi-public or private discord spaces. In my own groups Discord is rapidly out-pacing Slack as the default “space” for conversation.Once they add threading Discord will really arrive 😂Come and go as you please in my Discord - you can take or leave the chat spaces. Maybe you just want to join the session next Tuesday and that’s totally fine! Or maybe you want to really stick around and get comfortable - in which case great, grab a coffee and hang out.Finally - because Discord is free I hope there are no (fewer) power dynamics at play. I can make this my own space, how I like. Want your own? Go get it!Join my Discord here (Note access is now closed - DM me for an invite)            Note I did try and set up a web-based chat space for my website using web sockets. It was fun and let us jam to music in sync but I could never quite get my code robust enough to actually work…. So here we are. &#8617;      "

  "content": "I’m interested in new ways of creating conversation and discussion online. Quotebacks is a kind of attempt at encouraging cross-blog conversation. But in reality if we think of this blog as my “home” on the web - then conversation happens in a variety of spaces, but mostly on twitter.But Twitter comments are of a particular type (the medium is the message!) - and are open by default. Increasingly I’m interested in slightly deeper conversations - the kind of things that happen in twitter DMs or over email. But these are often 1:1 - where many of them would be much more interesting as small group discussions.So if my blog is one “space” and twitter is another “space” - what new spaces might exist?  Twitter: A realtime fully public commons  Website: A fully public but slower space  Tinyletter: A cozy space but a slower pace  Discord: A semi-public space for realtime conversationDiscord - a Realtime Cozy Chat SpaceI’ve set up a “tomcritchlow” discord space1. I’m planning on using it for:  Longer/deeper discussions triggered from my blog or twitter (“take it to the discord!” instead of “take it to the DMs!”).  A more persistent space for people who want to review blog post drafts  A space to host real-time sessionsThe plan is for this space to be fairly small, fairly quiet and more intimate than my public blog/twitter spaces. It looks like this:I anticipate only a handful of active users at once and the number of channels is going to be limited. For now there’s discussion for:  #cafe: Casual chat and conversation  #introductions: Introduce yourself!  #indie-consulting: Chatting all things indie consulting  #blogging: Chatting all things blogs  #tomcritchlow-rss: RSS will auto-post blog posts hereThe First Open Discord Session: Thinking in PublicI’m going to run an open session next Tuesday (14th July) at 1pm EST on the topic of Thinking in Public.Hopefully this will be useful for:  Bloggers who are stuck  People who want to start blogging  Agencies interested in “content marketing” that doesn’t suck  Fans of the blog!The format is going to be discord voice channel + a figma file. We’re gonna jam live!Discord’s FutureLet’s not call it a community. Discord feels more like a space than a community - there’s no user accounts (you make a discord account not a tomcritchlow-discord account). And increasingly the open social spaces like twitter are fragmenting into smaller semi-public or private discord spaces. In my own groups Discord is rapidly out-pacing Slack as the default “space” for conversation.Once they add threading Discord will really arrive 😂Come and go as you please in my Discord - you can take or leave the chat spaces. Maybe you just want to join the session next Tuesday and that’s totally fine! Or maybe you want to really stick around and get comfortable - in which case great, grab a coffee and hang out.Finally - because Discord is free I hope there are no (fewer) power dynamics at play. I can make this my own space, how I like. Want your own? Go get it!Join my Discord here (Note access is now closed - DM me for an invite)            Note I did try and set up a web-based chat space for my website using web sockets. It was fun and let us jam to music in sync but I could never quite get my code robust enough to actually work…. So here we are. &#8617;      "

  "date": "June 24, 2020",
  "content": "This is part 4 of the Yes! And… series. Start with part 1 here.In chapter 3 we looked at the difference between “problem solving” and “capacity building” consultants. Reframing consulting as capacity building opens up the ability to work on long open-ended projects with a fundamentally collaborative stance with the client. Per Paresha &amp; Philip1:  “Long-term fulfillment of social obligations, as part of a community of practice.”Unlike problem solving - capacity building fundamentally requires the consultant to learn how to get things done within the “community of practice” of the client’s organization -  working across a wide range of teams, people and projects.The consultant - operating on a faster feedback loop than an employee - needs to learn how to map the org, sense the flow of power, and set the correct status all within a short span of time in order to get things done.Mapping &amp; navigating an organization requires appreciating that the org chart is a political map, drawn by those at the top of the organization and holding certain symbolic and functional power. But also only crudely (if at all) mapping to the actual power flows and status games inside an organization.Getting things done and changing an organization begins with understanding the power dynamic of the people and teams involved.Let’s start with the org chart and gradually peel away the layers to get to deeper concepts like power potholes and status games…Part 1: Mapping The Org ChartAt the beginning of an engagement the org chart is all we have. Mapping an org chart starts simple and scrappy and rapidly evolves to something more useful. Here’s a sample sketch to illustrate how it works (and yes I often literally sketch these in my notebook):Day 0 - initial contact - typically I don’t get much more information than the position title of the person looking to hire - “VP Marketing” or something similar.Day 1 - the first day of work - you meet a few people and begin to develop a rudimentary working assumption of the local org chart around your point of contact. So maybe there’s two teams that report into the VP and you have a name for the person running each team but little more.However, especially in cases of  embedded work where I’m on-site with the client, by day 15 my understanding of the org chart might look something like this:At this point our fictional org chart map starts to show some new features:  The VP point of contact is now situated relative to the CEO, relative to the growth executive team  The CEO is loosely situated relative to the board  Certain actors on the map are “cancelled” - closed door conversations suggest certain VPs are on their way out (or have lost the faith of the CEO)  Conversely, it’s becoming obvious that some actors are more effective than others - able to get things done inside the organizationWhile this model of the org chart continues to evolve, it becomes less useful as a tool to “navigate” the organization. The legible connections between teams and people are clearer but the underlying power structures are only just starting to emerge.An Org Chart is designed for legibility not accuracySketching out the org chart is helpful in the early days - but org charts are incredibly simplistic when it comes to actually mapping the organization. As Venkatesh says about org charts:  “A good deal of the process is about imposing anxiety-alleviating platonic structural beauty.”The org chart of boxes and lines shows reporting structures in a legible way, but does little else. If you’re using the org chart to get the “lay of the land” it’s necessary to understand its limitations.The org chart tells us about the topology of the organization, i.e. the formal connections between people. It tells us nothing of the topography, i.e. the lay of the land. The messy distortions.Layering influence on top of a network topology starts to give a clearer picture of what’s really going on:This illustration comes from a fascinating analysis that Carta conducted examining the influence inside their organization.This network-model showing a small number of highly connected nodes accurately represents the lived experience of working inside a dynamic and complex organization.These network graphs however only tell you so much about power. The node graph above shows influence &amp; communication channels but not necessarily power flows.For the consultant attempting to get things done - relational power dynamics are everything and as much as you’re understanding culture inside an organization, you need to understand the flows of power.I start on day zero with a crude org chart sketched in my notebook, and over the first week convert the org chart into a network graph which then grows into a crazy wall2 with key power players mapped.Understanding Localized PowerOnce you’ve mapped a few organizations - you begin to realize some key insights. Firstly - power is often centralized in a very small number of people. And these people are not always found in the c-suite.There are three common types of people who hold power inside organizations - decision makers, gatekeepers and makers:Decision makers are the most common and most obvious type of power player - typically these are executives or senior employees. The kind of people who need to be consulted to make a decision - or have the latitude to make decisions themselves. One type of decision maker you might forget to pay attention to is the in-house expert with a history of success:Example: I worked with a client where the executive team was mostly the usual suspects (i.e. old white dudes) but anytime the executive team got together they included a more junior senior director. This senior director had managed to get inside the inner circle not by seniority but by expertise - he was an expert at SEO strategy and when making decisions that impacted SEO the senior executive team would defer to him. This in-house expert can hold significant power because for certain decisions the exec team defers to them for sign-off.Gatekeepers come in two common forms, gatekeepers of time and gatekeepers of data. Executive assistants control significant power through owning executives time and schedule. Less obvious are those people who control access to data:Example: I had a client where a small in-house data team was responsible for pulling reporting, generating analyses etc. The organization lacked robust dashboards or shared views of data so almost all requests for data went through the data team - this led to the situation of the senior leaders in the org consistently putting requests through the data team. This caused the team to wield significant power (while also overwhelming themselves via constantly getting urgent requests from the exec team).Makers are the least commonly understood power nodes in my experience. On the one hand it’s as simple as - those who can make things hold power - but on the other hand that doesn’t quite capture the unreasonable power that (often relatively junior) employees can have through being able to make things. This is especially true for people who can combine skillsets in unique ways:Example: I worked with a publishing client a few years ago and I worked with a series of editors. Each responsible for a section of the website. Only one editor however combined the ability to make content with the sufficient know-how in HTML &amp; design to actually build new and innovative content experiences (i.e. page templates, in-line elements etc). As a result this editor ended up being a significant source of power - often pulled aside by senior execs to help build something new, prototype a new idea or just make something better in a hurry.There’s one universal rule to spot power nodes - look for who gets brought into the room.When an executive stops the meeting to demand someone else should be in the room - that’s a sign of significant power. When a conversation constantly references someone’s name (e.g. an exec assistant) that’s a sign of significant power3.The Behavior of Power NodesOnce you realize that power is localized into a small number of people and that they are spread across the org chart - you need to pay close attention to the way those people operate. Their ways of working - while they might seem trivial - represent an opportunity for the consultant to accelerate their own learning curve and learn to get things done inside a client’s organization.One example of this localized ways of working is what Venkatesh calls “calendar weather”:Consulting Tip #11: Pay attention to calendar management practices in client organizations, especially around senior executive schedules, and chat with admins whenever possible to learn the typical patterns of calendar craziness and how they cope.&mdash; The Art of Gig (@artofgig) June 5, 2019“Calendar weather” is a great example of a small way of working - a localized piece of organizational culture that can have outsized impact when viewed through the lens of network graphs.A key individual in the system can have mental models, ways of working or personal habits that can become associated with “the way to get ahead” or “how to get things done”. Emulating these ways of working and adopting them for your own projects inside the organization can instantly give you momentum.Power PotholesThe opposite of localized power is power potholes. Areas of the org chart that at first glance might look safe (“they’re a VP! They should have buy-in and the ability to get things done!”) but when leaned on turn out to be weak and can’t support your weight.In the early days of a client engagement - watch and listen closely for unusual instances of cause and effect - i.e. when someone says or does something that doesn’t make sense. When something that you think should usually or rationally lead to X instead leads to Y you’re usually missing a hidden undercurrent of power.Notice turns of phrase, rejected ideas or a statement that turns the room to silence. These mis-steps are power potholes in the consultant’s path. Notice them, write them down, meditate on them, and try and ask yourself: what power structures exist here to explain this anomaly?Example 1: in my own consulting work I led a design sprint to build a new product within the organization, using a VP as exec sponsor. Unfortunately, only during the project did I realize that the VP was weak and lacked buy-in and support from the other execs. In theory that VP should have supported that project but in practice, like stepping in a pothole accidentally, the system jolts and the project stalls for non visible reasons.Example 2: In the early stages of a client project I’m trying to coordinate a new workstream - and I suggest that the editorial director can lead the review of existing content. I haven’t met this person yet and I’m leaning on the org chart and job titles. This idea gets rejected and new options emerge. This gives me pause in the moment (why not the editorial director?) but only later in the project do I realize that the editorial director is out of favor with the executive team.Power potholes and localized power nodes matter for full-time employees too. Employees, however, have the luxury of time to settle into and understand power structures.The consultant on the other hand, is on a tighter timeline and often operating cross-functionally far more than traditional employees so understanding these dynamics, and understanding them quickly is critically important to effective strategy work.&amp;To wrap part 1 of this piece - it’s clear that to get things done inside a client’s organization you need to create your own map. Something more nuanced than the org chart that maps the flow of influence and power. Once you have this map you can better understand how things get done.This perspective mostly treats the consultant as a silent observer. Now, in part 2 let’s more closely examine the role the consultant plays as an outsider entering and disrupting these power flows.&amp;Part 2: The Consultant Has No Place on the MapUnderstanding the flows of power on the map is one thing - understanding your own place in those flows is another entirely.As we map the org chart and the network graph we begin to see: the consultant has no place on the map.Capacity building consulting requires necessarily working across functions, teams and people. Momentum for new capacity inside organizations comes from getting buy-in and wind in your sails - which requires some kind of strolling across the organization4.However, as you stroll across the organization there’s often no fixed home for the consultant, no stable identity to tie back to. The best you have is your executive sponsor as an anchor to the org chart, but even that can be tenuous depending how much autonomy you have.I like to imagine the consultant as a quantum structure on top of a classical map (the org chart). While the map is fixed and tangible, the quantum structure behaves strangely and has bizarre properties like non-locality. This non-locality of the consultant brings with it an uncertainty with regards to power structures.Employees inside the organization settle into a stable view of the existing power flows, while the consultant creates an unknown quantity - partly as an outsider and partly because capacity building explicitly requires building or re-arranging parts of the existing power structures.For employees, status relationships are often stable and clear inside organizations. Not only who you report to but a vague sense of “who am I senior to” and “who is senior to me”.But the consultant has no place on the org chart - in fact they “move around the org chart” constantly.Example: an 18 month engagement might see me working across design, product, editorial, strategy, content, marketing etc over the course of the engagement as various projects and needs arise. This can be a mix of senior projects working with the VP Product or a small fast project working directly with the freelance content writers. The high/low and lateral movement across the org chart can be far and wide.This lateral movement across the map requires a minimum social capital and charm to be able to appear in meetings or across teams without offending stakeholders. Winning hearts and minds across the org. This is a very high stakes and nuanced game5.The only way to play this high-stakes game is by realizing and recognizing status games.Status Games &amp; TransactionsBecause the consultant has no place on the map - they have no assigned status. This is unnerving at first and brings with it a unique challenge - the consultant has to set their own status.It can be a shock to realize that your status relationships are not fixed - you have to set your status relationship with each person you meet individually.This means that you might end up with strange non-continuous status relationships - i.e. you might be above the status of the VP of marketing in one context, but below the status of a marketing manager in another:While this might seem esoteric - status has ultimate power in determining your social interactions. Here’s a quote from the book Impro by Keith Johnstone:  ‘Try to get your status just a little above or below your partner’s,’ I said, and I insisted that the gap should be minimal. The actors seemed to know exactly what I meant and the work was transformed. The scenes became ‘authentic’, and actors seemed marvelously observant. Suddenly we understood that every inflection and movement implies a status, and that no action is due to chance, or really ‘motiveless’. It was hysterically funny, but at the same time very alarming.There is a lot to unpack once you start noticing status transactions, particularly once you start to think of status as something that can be changed (again, from Impro):  All our secret maneuverings were exposed. If someone asked a question we didn’t bother to answer it, we concentrated on why it had been asked. No one could make an ‘innocuous’ remark without everyone instantly grasping what lay behind it. Normally we are ‘forbidden’ to see status transactions except when there’s a conflict. In reality status transactions continue all the time. In the park we’ll notice the ducks squabbling, but not how carefully they keep their distances when they are not.As you establish status with everyone you meet your aim should be a “minimal” status gap, as Keith suggests. Aiming to be slightly above or slightly below their status provides the most fruitful and effective environment to get work done.But when to set high status and when to set low status?Strategy, Stewardship &amp; StatusI’ve written before about my mental model for retained strategy projects: strategy &amp; stewardship6.What’s interesting about these two modes of work is that they often require blending different high/low status ideas.Effective work looks something like this status 2x2:Working with executives: strategy is default high status, stewardship is default low status.Working with employees: strategy is default low status, stewardship is default high status.Let’s unpack that:Strategy StatusDuring periods of strategy work there are typically two modes of working:  Gathering insights, data and knowledge from across the org  Presenting work to execs or sparring with execsIn 1) the consultant has to stroll across the organization and attempt to get knowledge, buy-in and insights from employees who likely have little clue who the consultant is, and have not worked with them before. Personally - I find the mode of low status most helpful here. Attempting not to assert authority but rather persuade that helping me gather information is useful for them too.Conversely - in 2) I find the correct posture is high status. Executives almost universally thrive on confidence and presenting a strategy roadmap usually requires equal parts real experience and some projected confidence and enthusiasm for the ideas.Stewardship StatusWhen working on stewardship projects there are typically two modes of working:  Running processes, project management &amp; operations  Reporting &amp; communicating those projects back to the exec teamHere - the status is flipped. For 1) the most useful status is high status - essentially acting like a manager and leader to ensure that the wheels are turning, projects are shipping on time etc. Providing leadership and clarity for teams you’re working with that “things are OK” and “here’s why we’re doing this”.And in 2) we’re acting more like a VP than a consultant - presenting low-status to report “up” to the exec team on what’s going on.Remember that “high status” is more correctly “just above the status of the executive” and “low status” is more correctly “just below the status of the executive.Why does this all work?Working with Executives - long term retainers work best when you start high status, i.e. where you can be the expert in the room. But over time no executive wants to stay low status so you have to switch at some point to them telling you what to do. This is a direct result of shifting from strategy to stewardship.Working with Employees - every employee is threatened by external consultants coming in so you have to begin by playing low status - this way you can gain their confidence. Then as you increasingly gain context for the business and knowledge of how they work you can switch to high status to begin owning stewardship initiatives you outlined early.Fast Status Switching &amp; Improv StrategyThere’s one more wrinkle. If we recall this chart of strategy (green) and stewardship (blue):We see that neither line ever truly hits zero - there’s always some combination of strategy and stewardship.And we know that strategy relies on spontaneous moments (see: the serendipity deficit from chapter 1).A defining characteristic of executives is the ability to hold a short-term and long-term view at the same time. So a single interaction might blend both short-term priorities, tasks, operations and long-term vision and mission questions.So as a consultant operating in the theatre of work, it’s possible that you have to switch status between tasks in a single day, or even harder - switch status within a single conversation!Let’s take a look at this sample conversation to illustrate (highly simplified and exaggerated):Exec: Hey, when are we presenting the roadmap to the board?Consultant: The meeting is set for next Thursday, but that means Mark the VP of product can’t make it because they’re on vacation.Exec: Ok, do we have everything we need from Mark before he heads out on vacation?Consultant: Yes. But actually I think we should remove the product section of the roadmap. I think we’re already presenting a complicated roadmap and we don’t have enough confidence in the product parts of the roadmap. I think it  would undermine our confidence that we have elsewhere in the org. Let’s take that section and trim it down to a few slides to show the full roadmap and impact as coming later.Can you spot the status switch?

  "content": "This is part 4 of the Yes! And… series. Start with part 1 here.In chapter 3 we looked at the difference between “problem solving” and “capacity building” consultants. Reframing consulting as capacity building opens up the ability to work on long open-ended projects with a fundamentally collaborative stance with the client. Per Paresha &amp; Philip1:  “Long-term fulfillment of social obligations, as part of a community of practice.”Unlike problem solving - capacity building fundamentally requires the consultant to learn how to get things done within the “community of practice” of the client’s organization -  working across a wide range of teams, people and projects.The consultant - operating on a faster feedback loop than an employee - needs to learn how to map the org, sense the flow of power, and set the correct status all within a short span of time in order to get things done.Mapping &amp; navigating an organization requires appreciating that the org chart is a political map, drawn by those at the top of the organization and holding certain symbolic and functional power. But also only crudely (if at all) mapping to the actual power flows and status games inside an organization.Getting things done and changing an organization begins with understanding the power dynamic of the people and teams involved.Let’s start with the org chart and gradually peel away the layers to get to deeper concepts like power potholes and status games…Part 1: Mapping The Org ChartAt the beginning of an engagement the org chart is all we have. Mapping an org chart starts simple and scrappy and rapidly evolves to something more useful. Here’s a sample sketch to illustrate how it works (and yes I often literally sketch these in my notebook):Day 0 - initial contact - typically I don’t get much more information than the position title of the person looking to hire - “VP Marketing” or something similar.Day 1 - the first day of work - you meet a few people and begin to develop a rudimentary working assumption of the local org chart around your point of contact. So maybe there’s two teams that report into the VP and you have a name for the person running each team but little more.However, especially in cases of  embedded work where I’m on-site with the client, by day 15 my understanding of the org chart might look something like this:At this point our fictional org chart map starts to show some new features:  The VP point of contact is now situated relative to the CEO, relative to the growth executive team  The CEO is loosely situated relative to the board  Certain actors on the map are “cancelled” - closed door conversations suggest certain VPs are on their way out (or have lost the faith of the CEO)  Conversely, it’s becoming obvious that some actors are more effective than others - able to get things done inside the organizationWhile this model of the org chart continues to evolve, it becomes less useful as a tool to “navigate” the organization. The legible connections between teams and people are clearer but the underlying power structures are only just starting to emerge.An Org Chart is designed for legibility not accuracySketching out the org chart is helpful in the early days - but org charts are incredibly simplistic when it comes to actually mapping the organization. As Venkatesh says about org charts:  “A good deal of the process is about imposing anxiety-alleviating platonic structural beauty.”The org chart of boxes and lines shows reporting structures in a legible way, but does little else. If you’re using the org chart to get the “lay of the land” it’s necessary to understand its limitations.The org chart tells us about the topology of the organization, i.e. the formal connections between people. It tells us nothing of the topography, i.e. the lay of the land. The messy distortions.Layering influence on top of a network topology starts to give a clearer picture of what’s really going on:This illustration comes from a fascinating analysis that Carta conducted examining the influence inside their organization.This network-model showing a small number of highly connected nodes accurately represents the lived experience of working inside a dynamic and complex organization.These network graphs however only tell you so much about power. The node graph above shows influence &amp; communication channels but not necessarily power flows.For the consultant attempting to get things done - relational power dynamics are everything and as much as you’re understanding culture inside an organization, you need to understand the flows of power.I start on day zero with a crude org chart sketched in my notebook, and over the first week convert the org chart into a network graph which then grows into a crazy wall2 with key power players mapped.Understanding Localized PowerOnce you’ve mapped a few organizations - you begin to realize some key insights. Firstly - power is often centralized in a very small number of people. And these people are not always found in the c-suite.There are three common types of people who hold power inside organizations - decision makers, gatekeepers and makers:Decision makers are the most common and most obvious type of power player - typically these are executives or senior employees. The kind of people who need to be consulted to make a decision - or have the latitude to make decisions themselves. One type of decision maker you might forget to pay attention to is the in-house expert with a history of success:Example: I worked with a client where the executive team was mostly the usual suspects (i.e. old white dudes) but anytime the executive team got together they included a more junior senior director. This senior director had managed to get inside the inner circle not by seniority but by expertise - he was an expert at SEO strategy and when making decisions that impacted SEO the senior executive team would defer to him. This in-house expert can hold significant power because for certain decisions the exec team defers to them for sign-off.Gatekeepers come in two common forms, gatekeepers of time and gatekeepers of data. Executive assistants control significant power through owning executives time and schedule. Less obvious are those people who control access to data:Example: I had a client where a small in-house data team was responsible for pulling reporting, generating analyses etc. The organization lacked robust dashboards or shared views of data so almost all requests for data went through the data team - this led to the situation of the senior leaders in the org consistently putting requests through the data team. This caused the team to wield significant power (while also overwhelming themselves via constantly getting urgent requests from the exec team).Makers are the least commonly understood power nodes in my experience. On the one hand it’s as simple as - those who can make things hold power - but on the other hand that doesn’t quite capture the unreasonable power that (often relatively junior) employees can have through being able to make things. This is especially true for people who can combine skillsets in unique ways:Example: I worked with a publishing client a few years ago and I worked with a series of editors. Each responsible for a section of the website. Only one editor however combined the ability to make content with the sufficient know-how in HTML &amp; design to actually build new and innovative content experiences (i.e. page templates, in-line elements etc). As a result this editor ended up being a significant source of power - often pulled aside by senior execs to help build something new, prototype a new idea or just make something better in a hurry.There’s one universal rule to spot power nodes - look for who gets brought into the room.When an executive stops the meeting to demand someone else should be in the room - that’s a sign of significant power. When a conversation constantly references someone’s name (e.g. an exec assistant) that’s a sign of significant power3.The Behavior of Power NodesOnce you realize that power is localized into a small number of people and that they are spread across the org chart - you need to pay close attention to the way those people operate. Their ways of working - while they might seem trivial - represent an opportunity for the consultant to accelerate their own learning curve and learn to get things done inside a client’s organization.One example of this localized ways of working is what Venkatesh calls “calendar weather”:Consulting Tip #11: Pay attention to calendar management practices in client organizations, especially around senior executive schedules, and chat with admins whenever possible to learn the typical patterns of calendar craziness and how they cope.&mdash; The Art of Gig (@artofgig) June 5, 2019“Calendar weather” is a great example of a small way of working - a localized piece of organizational culture that can have outsized impact when viewed through the lens of network graphs.A key individual in the system can have mental models, ways of working or personal habits that can become associated with “the way to get ahead” or “how to get things done”. Emulating these ways of working and adopting them for your own projects inside the organization can instantly give you momentum.Power PotholesThe opposite of localized power is power potholes. Areas of the org chart that at first glance might look safe (“they’re a VP! They should have buy-in and the ability to get things done!”) but when leaned on turn out to be weak and can’t support your weight.In the early days of a client engagement - watch and listen closely for unusual instances of cause and effect - i.e. when someone says or does something that doesn’t make sense. When something that you think should usually or rationally lead to X instead leads to Y you’re usually missing a hidden undercurrent of power.Notice turns of phrase, rejected ideas or a statement that turns the room to silence. These mis-steps are power potholes in the consultant’s path. Notice them, write them down, meditate on them, and try and ask yourself: what power structures exist here to explain this anomaly?Example 1: in my own consulting work I led a design sprint to build a new product within the organization, using a VP as exec sponsor. Unfortunately, only during the project did I realize that the VP was weak and lacked buy-in and support from the other execs. In theory that VP should have supported that project but in practice, like stepping in a pothole accidentally, the system jolts and the project stalls for non visible reasons.Example 2: In the early stages of a client project I’m trying to coordinate a new workstream - and I suggest that the editorial director can lead the review of existing content. I haven’t met this person yet and I’m leaning on the org chart and job titles. This idea gets rejected and new options emerge. This gives me pause in the moment (why not the editorial director?) but only later in the project do I realize that the editorial director is out of favor with the executive team.Power potholes and localized power nodes matter for full-time employees too. Employees, however, have the luxury of time to settle into and understand power structures.The consultant on the other hand, is on a tighter timeline and often operating cross-functionally far more than traditional employees so understanding these dynamics, and understanding them quickly is critically important to effective strategy work.&amp;To wrap part 1 of this piece - it’s clear that to get things done inside a client’s organization you need to create your own map. Something more nuanced than the org chart that maps the flow of influence and power. Once you have this map you can better understand how things get done.This perspective mostly treats the consultant as a silent observer. Now, in part 2 let’s more closely examine the role the consultant plays as an outsider entering and disrupting these power flows.&amp;Part 2: The Consultant Has No Place on the MapUnderstanding the flows of power on the map is one thing - understanding your own place in those flows is another entirely.As we map the org chart and the network graph we begin to see: the consultant has no place on the map.Capacity building consulting requires necessarily working across functions, teams and people. Momentum for new capacity inside organizations comes from getting buy-in and wind in your sails - which requires some kind of strolling across the organization4.However, as you stroll across the organization there’s often no fixed home for the consultant, no stable identity to tie back to. The best you have is your executive sponsor as an anchor to the org chart, but even that can be tenuous depending how much autonomy you have.I like to imagine the consultant as a quantum structure on top of a classical map (the org chart). While the map is fixed and tangible, the quantum structure behaves strangely and has bizarre properties like non-locality. This non-locality of the consultant brings with it an uncertainty with regards to power structures.Employees inside the organization settle into a stable view of the existing power flows, while the consultant creates an unknown quantity - partly as an outsider and partly because capacity building explicitly requires building or re-arranging parts of the existing power structures.For employees, status relationships are often stable and clear inside organizations. Not only who you report to but a vague sense of “who am I senior to” and “who is senior to me”.But the consultant has no place on the org chart - in fact they “move around the org chart” constantly.Example: an 18 month engagement might see me working across design, product, editorial, strategy, content, marketing etc over the course of the engagement as various projects and needs arise. This can be a mix of senior projects working with the VP Product or a small fast project working directly with the freelance content writers. The high/low and lateral movement across the org chart can be far and wide.This lateral movement across the map requires a minimum social capital and charm to be able to appear in meetings or across teams without offending stakeholders. Winning hearts and minds across the org. This is a very high stakes and nuanced game5.The only way to play this high-stakes game is by realizing and recognizing status games.Status Games &amp; TransactionsBecause the consultant has no place on the map - they have no assigned status. This is unnerving at first and brings with it a unique challenge - the consultant has to set their own status.It can be a shock to realize that your status relationships are not fixed - you have to set your status relationship with each person you meet individually.This means that you might end up with strange non-continuous status relationships - i.e. you might be above the status of the VP of marketing in one context, but below the status of a marketing manager in another:While this might seem esoteric - status has ultimate power in determining your social interactions. Here’s a quote from the book Impro by Keith Johnstone:  ‘Try to get your status just a little above or below your partner’s,’ I said, and I insisted that the gap should be minimal. The actors seemed to know exactly what I meant and the work was transformed. The scenes became ‘authentic’, and actors seemed marvelously observant. Suddenly we understood that every inflection and movement implies a status, and that no action is due to chance, or really ‘motiveless’. It was hysterically funny, but at the same time very alarming.There is a lot to unpack once you start noticing status transactions, particularly once you start to think of status as something that can be changed (again, from Impro):  All our secret maneuverings were exposed. If someone asked a question we didn’t bother to answer it, we concentrated on why it had been asked. No one could make an ‘innocuous’ remark without everyone instantly grasping what lay behind it. Normally we are ‘forbidden’ to see status transactions except when there’s a conflict. In reality status transactions continue all the time. In the park we’ll notice the ducks squabbling, but not how carefully they keep their distances when they are not.As you establish status with everyone you meet your aim should be a “minimal” status gap, as Keith suggests. Aiming to be slightly above or slightly below their status provides the most fruitful and effective environment to get work done.But when to set high status and when to set low status?Strategy, Stewardship &amp; StatusI’ve written before about my mental model for retained strategy projects: strategy &amp; stewardship6.What’s interesting about these two modes of work is that they often require blending different high/low status ideas.Effective work looks something like this status 2x2:Working with executives: strategy is default high status, stewardship is default low status.Working with employees: strategy is default low status, stewardship is default high status.Let’s unpack that:Strategy StatusDuring periods of strategy work there are typically two modes of working:  Gathering insights, data and knowledge from across the org  Presenting work to execs or sparring with execsIn 1) the consultant has to stroll across the organization and attempt to get knowledge, buy-in and insights from employees who likely have little clue who the consultant is, and have not worked with them before.

  "content": "There’s very little writing and knowledge available for indie consultants that is any good. So I’ve long admired Art of Gig from Venkatesh as a breath of fresh air and thinking. It’s helped me a ton in my own journey as an independent. So it was a great honor to get to write a guest issue for the newsletter. See the original here. Thanks Venkatesh. I’ve published a copy here for my archives:I’ve long aspired to be an indie consultant with a default mode of sparring work. From reading about it on Venkatesh’s website to experiencing it in brief flashes on consulting projects (often waking up on the mat, dizzy, wondering what hit me), sparring has been an aspirational end goal; something to quest towards.I’ve been an indie consultant for ~6 years and have gradually managed to secure sparring consulting engagements. But rather than operate on stand-alone sparring engagements they’ve been embedded (often at the end of) a “more traditional” consulting engagement focused on deliverables and such.However, I recently participated in the first sparring training dojo as part of the Yak Collective and came to the realization that pure consulting sparring is an odd thing to quest for. For starters, it’s not very lucrative, as Venkatesh outlines:  I estimate that a good sparring partner can support no more than half a dozen active clients in any given month without burning out. And it typically takes half a dozen meetings of 60-90 minutes across six months or so for the sessions to become truly high-value.  Most importantly, though you might be able to bill at a high rate, due to the individualized, automation-resistant, time-intensive nature of it, you’re not going to get mega-rich doing it. Sparring is an artisanal kind of consulting. You can make a decent living from it, but if you’re solving for big money from a 4-hour work week, you should look to a different kind of consulting business model.  Introduction to executive sparringContrast this to a more traditional consulting gig that might be 5 figures a month and involve several days of work a week.So how can it be that sparring is such an aspirational model for indie consultants?Thinking vs DoingI believe the answer lies in the aspirational nature of sparring work — in short, it’s thinking for a living.Maybe the best analogy is: reaching a point as an indie consultant where you can generate enough clients to be sparring as your sole consulting work is like reaching tenure. You’re set.Let’s illustrate with a dumb graphic:My theory goes:When you start out consulting most of your billable hours are spent doing. You get hired for things like writing content, managing ad campaigns, photo shoots, executing campaigns, building websites.As you get more senior, more experience and as you get access to more senior executives the work starts to include thinking. Your website design project is so good that you’re included in the brand refresh project, your marketing campaign was so good you are invited to restructure the marketing org, your project management was so good you’re invited to help shape OKRs for the company, etc.Thinking for a living is more fun.Thinking - the work where you’re looking at client’s organizations as complex systems with access to real decision makers is where the rewarding high value work comes in.As you get a taste of thinking for a living it becomes tempting to want to spend all your time thinking.The (wrong!) mental model here is of the indie consultant rising to partner status — a partner at McKinsey or Bain spends all day long thinking, not doing. So we chase the same as an indie consultant — aspiring to get paid handsome sums of money to think all day long.Except. As an indie typically there’s no one to delegate to.  So you need to roll up your sleeves and blend doing and thinking. (I’ve written about this concept under the label “strategy and stewardship” in this post the strategic independent).This is where I find myself 6 years into my indie consulting career. Blending executive sparring with executive level capacity building for clients. This might look like:      A weekly sparring session with the CMO, and:        2-3 days a week working with the marketing org on various strategic initiatives  The first feels like getting paid to think, the second feels like getting paid to do.My hunch however is that this is a local revenue maximum. I often work with clients where I get paid approximately a sparring day rate across all my work — both the thinking and the doing — and this lets me bill well and log a good number of hours per client.While I’d love to abandon the doing work and focus on the thinking — on the sparring — I think it’s a mistake to prematurely optimize for thinking for a living. Especially while I am young enough to have some doing left in me.But — 6 years into my indie consulting career — I’m laying the foundation for transitioning to sparring in the next few years. Sounds crazy? There are some good reasons.The Benefits of Sparring: Owning your TimeSo is sparring just an intellectually stimulating but less-well-paid version of consulting?No — there are some clear benefits of chasing sparring as consulting.Firstly, I’m a decade younger than Venkatesh and still able to pull stunts like billing 3 days a week to one client and 3 days a week to another client. Dipping into energy reserves and sprinting on work for sustained periods throughout the year. Much like physical fitness I can already feel my capacity for this declining.Secondly, doing captures a large portion of your head space. When you’re managing a marketing org you can’t “take Thursday and Friday offline to write blog posts”. Operational work requires high availability and an “always-on” mentality. Especially if you’re in doing mode for multiple clients at once. It can be incredibly demanding on your time and any side project / writing / teaching / long-term research gets consistently interrupted, paused or put on hold.Thirdly, doing is not resilient work. Doing work is much more reliant on the economy, access to local clients and more. Conversely, sparring work thrives in uncertainty as Nicolas Colin wrote in Launching My Executive Sparring Practice:  What do you do as an executive in a world perpetually ridden with uncertainty—because of the nature of computing and networks, because of macroeconomic ups and downs, because of the public constantly threatening to erupt in revolt, because of activists that are all too happy to fuel that perpetual fire to force you to comply with whatever they demand?  What you do is find a good sparring partner who will help you navigate the uncertainty with clear strategic insights and frequent adjustments to your worldview, helping you to constantly refine your long-term thesis.Shifting to remote consulting has been a big strain on my consulting practice — not so much on Venkatesh’s.In a nutshell, sparring work is long-term stable, well-paid work relative to the amount of headspace and energy required.Tenure-track not Partner-trackWhich brings me to the (correct) mental model — not of an indie consultant reaching “partner” but of indie consultant reaching “tenure”. The ability to consistently generate sparring clients is a great way to earn steady money, thinking for a living and with a reinforced OODA loop that connects the value you create for clients to the value you generate personally from sparring. As Venkatesh outlined:  You and the client are each driving complementary OODA loops that intersect in the practice of sparring. You are inside each other’s OODA loops in a way that mutually reinforces both your learning processes. Yours is an appreciative learning process, theirs is an instrumental learning process.  The guru factorThe ability to earn good stable money while keeping a significant amount of time and headspace free is not to be under-estimated. It maps to the idea of a tenured professor in the way that they are free to explore self-directed initiatives and projects.Let’s update that doing/thinking chart form above to include a third wave of “self-directed” work:As the doing work gives way to sparring work, so too does sparring work give way to self directed work. I’ve plotted myself and Venkatesh (roughly) on the chart to illustrate roughly where we both land.Venkatesh, obviously, has been busy: Ribbonfarm, ArtofGig, Breaking Smart, Refactor Camp, Tempo, being a Berggruen Fellow, book #2 etc and is now earning a not insignificant income from self-directed projects.And this is the end goal — the aspirational nature of yearning for sparring work — it’s that it’s a path, an enablement to get to a place where you can have some model of “tenure” to explore your own self-directed projects without having to force those projects to live on their own immediately. You leverage skill in doing into sparring work and you leverage skill in sparring work to get to self-directed projects and revenue.Personally, I’ve updated my mental model. I’m no longer chasing sparring as it’s own goal but rather chasing sparring as a means to create leverage to maximize time, energy, and self-directed interests.The Compound Interest of Networked WritingThe final point I’ll make here is about how to chase sparring. For indie consultants who want to follow this path (and to be clear there are other paths to follow) the evolution and progression across this chart from doing -thinking -self-directed is defined by the volume and quality of the thinking in public.As Venkatesh illustrated in the guru factor:  About 90% of your effectiveness as a sparring partner derives from the depth of your appreciative world view, developed and expressed through critical reading, writing, podcasts, and talks. Only about 10% depends on your in-session sparring skills.So we might overlay on the graph above a model of thinking in public (writing or podcasting or public speaking or vlogging):Thinking in public is both a product of spending time sparring with clients and a necessary driver of getting sparring clients. In short, chasing sparring as a consulting model (and ultimately chasing the self-directed “tenure” model) requires investing in thinking in public, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop of clients hiring you for thinking and higher quality thinking in public."

I really loved this piece of writing on Context over control: the future of remote work)What I love about Pulse is the idea of in-context knowledge. Something friend Noah Brier is doubling down on with his startup Variance:Knowledge, as they say, is power. But knowledge without context is often meaningless. Last year I was introduced to the idea of the “skills transfer gap” in a Harvard Business Review article about executive education. The gap is the one between where a skill is learned and where it is practiced, and can be the deciding factor on whether someone actually internalizes something. From the article:One of the biggest complaints we hear about executive education is that the skills and capabilities developed don’t get applied on the job. This challenges the very foundation of executive education, but it is not surprising. Research by cognitive, educational, and applied psychologists dating back a century, along with more-recent work in the neuroscience of learning, reveals that the distance between where a skill is learned (the locus of acquisition) and where it is applied (the locus of application) greatly influences the probability that a student will put that skill into practice.While they’re talking about executive education, it could just as easily be applied to the problems we face in documenting everyday practices and processes. The further the learning space is from the doing space, the harder it is to internalize and put into practice. Ultimately organizing your documentation is about finding ways to shrink this gap and make it easier to discover and use the knowledge stored in your documentation when you need it most.Noah Brierhttps://www.variance.com/posts/organizing-your-documentationOf course - the ur-god of company writing and blogging is Amazon and their famous 6-page memos:Six-Page Narratives We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structuredsix-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing.They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.  In thehandstand example, it’s pretty straightforward to recognize high standards. It wouldn’t be difficult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well-executed handstand, and then you’re either doing it or you’re not. Thewriting example is very different. The difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I find that much of the time,readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable. Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard,but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more!They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right.

I really loved this piece of writing on Context over control: the future of remote work)What I love about Pulse is the idea of in-context knowledge. Something friend Noah Brier is doubling down on with his startup Variance:Knowledge, as they say, is power. But knowledge without context is often meaningless. Last year I was introduced to the idea of the “skills transfer gap” in a Harvard Business Review article about executive education. The gap is the one between where a skill is learned and where it is practiced, and can be the deciding factor on whether someone actually internalizes something. From the article:One of the biggest complaints we hear about executive education is that the skills and capabilities developed don’t get applied on the job. This challenges the very foundation of executive education, but it is not surprising. Research by cognitive, educational, and applied psychologists dating back a century, along with more-recent work in the neuroscience of learning, reveals that the distance between where a skill is learned (the locus of acquisition) and where it is applied (the locus of application) greatly influences the probability that a student will put that skill into practice.While they’re talking about executive education, it could just as easily be applied to the problems we face in documenting everyday practices and processes. The further the learning space is from the doing space, the harder it is to internalize and put into practice. Ultimately organizing your documentation is about finding ways to shrink this gap and make it easier to discover and use the knowledge stored in your documentation when you need it most.Noah Brierhttps://www.variance.com/posts/organizing-your-documentationOf course - the ur-god of company writing and blogging is Amazon and their famous 6-page memos:Six-Page Narratives We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structuredsix-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of “study hall.” Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing.They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.  In thehandstand example, it’s pretty straightforward to recognize high standards. It wouldn’t be difficult to lay out in detail the requirements of a well-executed handstand, and then you’re either doing it or you’re not. Thewriting example is very different. The difference between a great memo and an average one is much squishier. It would be extremely hard to write down the detailed requirements that make up a great memo. Nevertheless, I find that much of the time,readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it’s not easily describable. Here’s what we’ve figured out. Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard,but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more!They’re trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we’re not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, setaside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind.

  "title": "The Challenges of Remote Consulting",

  "date": "May 6, 2020",
  "content": "Being a remote consultant is tough. I’ll be honest, I’m having a hard time being as effective as usual.There’s three core issues I’m seeing with remote consulting:  Lack of business context  Lack of improv people context  Faster planning cyclesI’m going to walk through them and see if we can find solutions together…1. Lack of Business ContextI talked in my post the strategic independent about how being strategic is fundamentally about understanding the overlapping contexts that your work sits in:So when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts:However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:                   @tomcritchlowThe Strategic Independent Go to text →  The challenge in remote work is that you get less access to adjacent contexts.It’s harder to gain awareness of the things that are happening outside your specific project - especially as a consultant. For example, I often get an @client.com email address but I’m usually not on the everyone@ emails. So I’m like a liminal pseudo-employee that misses some company-wide context.When you’re in the office it’s easier to soak this in via the peripheral. But there’s no peripheral vision when working remotely.The only way to address this is via over-communicating.A lot is said about the overwhelming status checkins while working remotely but, as a consultant, if anything you should be over-indexing on status updates.How to do this without overwhelming yourself of course is the challenge…2. Lack of Improv &amp; People ContextLacking business context is one thing - but lacking people context is another. What is your point of contact working on? What are they worrying about? How are they feeling?I often find myself being surprisingly effective as a consultant prioritizing my work around the just-in-time priorities of my point of contact rather than adhering strictly to a pre-defined project roadmap. This allows for a more agile approach (an approach often not available to regular employees!). But this improv-thinking and improv-working relies on the in-between people context.I wrote before about the way that consultants operate at a serendipity deficit:A failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.                   @tomcritchlowYes! and... Go to text →  And I’ve written before about the idea of missed feedback due to over-polishing work:Missed feedback - It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.                   @tomcritchlowYes! and... Go to text →  Except - without the IRL feedback this un-polished work can land poorly. You lose the in-context feedback loop working remotely:The solution here is…? Unclear.One anecdote - the successful client projects I’ve worked on remotely in the past have all relied on: a phone call habit with my point of contact.i.e. not a zoom or video chat, not a “meeting” - just a plain voice chat, often unscheduled. I think there’s something about this more improv and intimate conversation mode that allows for some of the above people-context-gathering.3. Faster OODA LoopsFinally - a third challenge, not specific to remote work but specific to times of uncertainty, is faster OODA loops. Companies are operating on faster cycles than ever before - shorter horizons and faster decision making:“Re-work the plan. Immediately. Not in a quarter. Not in a few weeks,” says Simon Khalaf, the current SVP and GM for Messaging at Twilio. (Back in 2008, he was the President and CEO of Flurry Analytics.) In other words, you shouldn’t be operating at the same tempo as you were 90 days ago, but it can be tough to go from planning quarterly to planning weekly. “We are at a time of incredible uncertainty. Changes that might have happened in a year are happening in a week. Macro shifts are happening fast, but the micro-level of what’s happening in your business — signed contracts, churn and so on — still may be slow,” says First Round’s Josh Kopelman.                   First RoundThe Founder's Field Guide for Navigating This Crisis — Advice from Recession-Era Leaders, Investors and Current CEOs Go to text →  Some of this I think is just going to be a new-normal as companies realize their planning cycles were far too long anyway. But as a consultant specifically we need to think about ways to re-scope work around shorter time frames.One challenge is juggling multiple client projects at once - previously you could buy yourself room for managing multiple timelines at once by setting reasonable expectations (“we’ll do the first round of design concepts in 2-3 weeks”). But increasingly these time-arbitrage windows are becoming razor-thin.Juggling multiple client projects then becomes a delicate balancing act of everything now. I find personally that it’s possible to operate at this level while consulting - threading the needle between back to back zoom calls, re-claiming 15mins due an early meeting end etc - but only for exceptionally short periods.A closing thought on sparring as a way throughAll of this - worryingly - points to my usual consulting style being less effective and more stressful.But there is one way to get through this - rescoping projects around the concept of sparring:As Venkatesh points out - sparring is an inherently 1:1 scoped work-stream where people-context and improv is built in by design.I’ve done a bunch of sparring-style work but mostly it’s emerged out of a long-term retainer. My personal challenge is going to be building an offering and persuading clients to leap to the sparring phase off the bat.We’ll see how it goes.How are you managing consulting remotely in times of uncertainty?"

But increasingly these time-arbitrage windows are becoming razor-thin.Juggling multiple client projects then becomes a delicate balancing act of everything now. I find personally that it’s possible to operate at this level while consulting - threading the needle between back to back zoom calls, re-claiming 15mins due an early meeting end etc - but only for exceptionally short periods.A closing thought on sparring as a way throughAll of this - worryingly - points to my usual consulting style being less effective and more stressful.But there is one way to get through this - rescoping projects around the concept of sparring:As Venkatesh points out - sparring is an inherently 1:1 scoped work-stream where people-context and improv is built in by design.I’ve done a bunch of sparring-style work but mostly it’s emerged out of a long-term retainer. My personal challenge is going to be building an offering and persuading clients to leap to the sparring phase off the bat.We’ll see how it goes.How are you managing consulting remotely in times of uncertainty?"

  "title": "After Peacetime",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/13/after-peacetime/",
  "date": "April 13, 2020",
  "content": "There’s a bunch of discussion right now about the peacetime CEO / wartime CEO mental model (for example here).For those not familiar, from Ben Horowitz at A16Z:Ben Horowitz in Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO - Andreessen Horowitz              Go to text →In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company’s survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission.           Unfortunately this model was never useful for independents. Being independent is a continual process of cycling through feast and famine - busy and quiet.In a regular year you might get hungry for new work 4 or 5 times1.Hunting for workEvery time your work slows down as an indie you get hungry. Even though I’ve been lucky enough to build up some reserves I feel the bite of negative cash flow very keenly. In short - I get hungry and go hunting.For paycheck types - hunting for work is typically a discrete event. You’re either looking for a job or you’re not. And those events are typically spaced out 12-24 months at a time. It’s a time of crisis for paycheck types because it’s all or nothing - when you’re out of work your income is zero.For indies - hunting for work is an “always on” activity. You’re often working for clients but not at full capacity and a typical gig lasts months not years so you’re always rolling off some client project and rolling onto another.This is where the peacetime/wartime analogy starts to break down. For companies and paycheck types you can more safely operate in “modes” like times of peace and times of war. Indies are hired guns where hunting is the only business we know and we’ve learned to be at peace with living on the hunt.But there are context switches and mode changes. What changes for indies is not if you’re hunting but rather how you hunt.Convergent Times / Convergent HuntingIn more normal times the way you hunt is to try and springboard every client engagement into bigger and better client engagements.For example - I spent the last 3-4 years working in media. First with commerce media, then in bigger commerce media then in audience development, then in media innovation. This laddering wasn’t exactly intentional but certainly reflected a series of clients, contacts and blog posts in that space.Every client engagement in a niche gives you:  Situational awareness for the industry / niche  Contacts and network of people &amp; agencies in the space  Insights and interesting things to write about  New case studies and further validationThe default mode is convergent - new clients are often building off previous ones. In fact in more normal (convergent) times this can even feel like a drag as you try and escape being pigeon-holed and boxed in. Some efforts are made to branch out but usually half-heartedly and broadly lazily if enough work is coming your way via convergent means.Divergent Times / Divergent HuntingBut these are not normal times. There’s nothing convergent about it - the world is hard-forking and the various branches of reality are fighting for dominance.My first instinct was to turtle my way out of it - shore up enough reserves to outlast the crisis. In my last post I said this:Tom Critchlow in The Quarantined Independent              Go to text →Finally - if you have the cash reserves to see you through this (big if…) then you should consider going subterranean and working on projects that won’t see the light of day until next year.           But I’m beginning to think this is the wrong mindset. Imagining there is a “return” to anything next year is misguided. Reality just hard forked and there’s no going back. The economy may return in some fashion or a new economy may emerge but life won’t ever look the same again.While on the one hand independents are royally f-ed with zero safety net - on the other hand independents have been training for years for this kind of uncertainty. We’ve been hunting for years. Indies are the most adept at exploring new frontiers. As Venkatesh said:Venkatesh Rao in The Free-Agent Diverarchy - Breaking Smart              Go to text →Work&nbsp;in the free-agent mode is a divergent economic activity, an evolutionary phenomenon that explores outward from a constantly expanding frontier,&nbsp;and acquires more depth, richness, and variety with every passing year. I call this a diverarchy -- the historical trace of a naturally divergent, expansionary, evolutionary pattern based on variation and natural selection of relatively stable forms.           Let’s call this divergent hunting - exploring possibility space to find the emergent clients, contracts, behaviors and ways of working and respond to them faster than anyone else. It’s the “constantly expanding frontier” that Venkatesh references that aims to find the small buds, shoots and green leaves of the “new normal” whatever that looks like.Here’s two explicit strategies for hunting in divergent times:1. Continuous Sensemaking in times of UncertaintyWe’re likely too early for much real signs of life for what comes next - but we can and should be developing our sensemaking skills and continuously iterating on our ideas to keep a sharp eye for what’s next.Something like this:Cedric Chin in Career Moats in a Recession              Go to text →The tricky thing about all of this is that skill markets are not perfectly observable. You’ll have to go hunting for trends. I’ll probably schedule a bunch of meetings at the end of this year, assuming COVID-19 blows over.

  "date": "April 13, 2020",
  "content": "There’s a bunch of discussion right now about the peacetime CEO / wartime CEO mental model (for example here).For those not familiar, from Ben Horowitz at A16Z:Ben Horowitz in Peacetime CEO/Wartime CEO - Andreessen Horowitz              Go to text →In peacetime, leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity. As a result, peacetime leaders employ techniques to encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. In wartime, by contrast, the company typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target. The company’s survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission.           Unfortunately this model was never useful for independents. Being independent is a continual process of cycling through feast and famine - busy and quiet.In a regular year you might get hungry for new work 4 or 5 times1.Hunting for workEvery time your work slows down as an indie you get hungry. Even though I’ve been lucky enough to build up some reserves I feel the bite of negative cash flow very keenly. In short - I get hungry and go hunting.For paycheck types - hunting for work is typically a discrete event. You’re either looking for a job or you’re not. And those events are typically spaced out 12-24 months at a time. It’s a time of crisis for paycheck types because it’s all or nothing - when you’re out of work your income is zero.For indies - hunting for work is an “always on” activity. You’re often working for clients but not at full capacity and a typical gig lasts months not years so you’re always rolling off some client project and rolling onto another.This is where the peacetime/wartime analogy starts to break down. For companies and paycheck types you can more safely operate in “modes” like times of peace and times of war. Indies are hired guns where hunting is the only business we know and we’ve learned to be at peace with living on the hunt.But there are context switches and mode changes. What changes for indies is not if you’re hunting but rather how you hunt.Convergent Times / Convergent HuntingIn more normal times the way you hunt is to try and springboard every client engagement into bigger and better client engagements.For example - I spent the last 3-4 years working in media. First with commerce media, then in bigger commerce media then in audience development, then in media innovation. This laddering wasn’t exactly intentional but certainly reflected a series of clients, contacts and blog posts in that space.Every client engagement in a niche gives you:  Situational awareness for the industry / niche  Contacts and network of people &amp; agencies in the space  Insights and interesting things to write about  New case studies and further validationThe default mode is convergent - new clients are often building off previous ones. In fact in more normal (convergent) times this can even feel like a drag as you try and escape being pigeon-holed and boxed in. Some efforts are made to branch out but usually half-heartedly and broadly lazily if enough work is coming your way via convergent means.Divergent Times / Divergent HuntingBut these are not normal times. There’s nothing convergent about it - the world is hard-forking and the various branches of reality are fighting for dominance.My first instinct was to turtle my way out of it - shore up enough reserves to outlast the crisis. In my last post I said this:Tom Critchlow in The Quarantined Independent              Go to text →Finally - if you have the cash reserves to see you through this (big if…) then you should consider going subterranean and working on projects that won’t see the light of day until next year.           But I’m beginning to think this is the wrong mindset. Imagining there is a “return” to anything next year is misguided. Reality just hard forked and there’s no going back. The economy may return in some fashion or a new economy may emerge but life won’t ever look the same again.While on the one hand independents are royally f-ed with zero safety net - on the other hand independents have been training for years for this kind of uncertainty. We’ve been hunting for years. Indies are the most adept at exploring new frontiers. As Venkatesh said:Venkatesh Rao in The Free-Agent Diverarchy - Breaking Smart              Go to text →Work&nbsp;in the free-agent mode is a divergent economic activity, an evolutionary phenomenon that explores outward from a constantly expanding frontier,&nbsp;and acquires more depth, richness, and variety with every passing year. I call this a diverarchy -- the historical trace of a naturally divergent, expansionary, evolutionary pattern based on variation and natural selection of relatively stable forms.           Let’s call this divergent hunting - exploring possibility space to find the emergent clients, contracts, behaviors and ways of working and respond to them faster than anyone else. It’s the “constantly expanding frontier” that Venkatesh references that aims to find the small buds, shoots and green leaves of the “new normal” whatever that looks like.Here’s two explicit strategies for hunting in divergent times:1. Continuous Sensemaking in times of UncertaintyWe’re likely too early for much real signs of life for what comes next - but we can and should be developing our sensemaking skills and continuously iterating on our ideas to keep a sharp eye for what’s next.Something like this:Cedric Chin in Career Moats in a Recession              Go to text →The tricky thing about all of this is that skill markets are not perfectly observable. You’ll have to go hunting for trends. I’ll probably schedule a bunch of meetings at the end of this year, assuming COVID-19 blows over. And in those meetings, I’ll be listening carefully for the organisational changes my friends are experiencing at their companies.           Except don’t schedule those meetings for the end of the year - that’s turtle thinking - instead act faster and more continuously to sense emergent ideas early.

  "content": "For the past few years I’ve been writing a book, serializing the posts on my blog: The Strategic Independent.I’ve always thought of this book as trying to be a “201” level reference - useful for those who already figured out the basics.It contains things like how to effectively embed yourself inside client organizations, balancing strategy &amp; execution &amp; the theatre of work.But we’re all beginners now.These topics feel out of touch with reality, while the underlying goal is the same: help indies survive and thrive. So I’m putting the book on pause and launching a new mini-series - a more urgent and hopefully more actionable series1:New Blogchain: The Quarantined IndependentThe series home will be here: The Quarantined Independent. Posts will drop out serially on my blog (and there’s always the rss feed).My plan is to think through what indies can do to find &amp; keep work, stay alive in the crisis and generally.Here’s some quick and dirty notes and ideas to kick us off:1. Indies are f-edNo one knows how this ends. And no one knows how long it’s gonna last. At the beginning of this 3-months of runway might have felt safe. Now I’m not sure 12 months of runway feels safe..And indies are due for even less support than everyone else.So shore up reserves, collect on your invoices right now, check your free cash flow…The new world order that emerges after this may well be more indie-friendly, but for now we’re in for a rough ride.2. Mutual aid for indiesThe last thing we need in these times is a cult of personality. Now more than ever we need collaboration and cooperation between indies.What does this look like?Pitch work with collaborators, pull in other indies to help out on projects, look for ways to extend contracts around to other indies. This also helps protect you psychologically from clients balking at your fees - it’s not only a self serving proposal but you’re gonna spread that money around.3. Focus your engagementsIn the current environment you should expect: shorter cycles of planning, execution, investment. Think projects not retainers, think actionable in 30 days not actionable this year.This is true for existing client work and any future leads that come in. Look for ways to establish a foothold with a smaller project before closing the larger retainer.For many clients there is still budget floating around but it’ll get spent in smaller, more clearly defined chunks. Everyone is going to have more scrutiny on SOWs and finance is gonna have real teeth in these discussions.So look for defined projects with clear scope that you can execute on quickly. Note this doesn’t necessarily mean it’s cheap - don’t undersell yourself just because money is tight - if you can stomach it you should hold rates steady. Even if you close your usual rate for a project work is going to get scarce so it’s important to get well paid where you can.4. Start your writingLet’s be clear - we’re not going to blog our way out of the slump. But writing is like compound interest - investing in a blogging habit now will pay off next year in spades when the economy gets going again.Every independent I know generates leads through their writing.Some reading:  Strategic Digital Gardening  Strange AttractionAnd, crucially - don’t forget to keep it weird. This age is the great weirding and the world that comes next isn’t going to want your LinkedIn “10 ways I….” bro-post. Let a little blogpunk creep in.5. Show the ProcessIf you’re tempted to spend some time getting your case studies in order might I humbly suggest that your time would be better spent becoming a thought leader. Thought leader?! Ugh. Well, actually no:  If you want to be good at “thought leadership”, the last thing you should do is say on your home page: “We are thought leaders,” or “We do thought leadership.”  Just declaring your organisation “thought leaders” does not make it a leader of anything, except perhaps PR.   Instead, you should actually lead with some thinking.   Start blogging or writing about what your thoughts are. It doesn’t matter if they’re half-formed or thoughts-in-progress (you can be explicit about that from the start, nobody will mind). The main thing is to show that you are capable of thinking about things, and to write clearly and simply about what your thoughts are.From the great Giles: don’t say you’re a thought leader.Ok - how do you lead with some thinking?For me - it often comes down to showing the process. The main thing most case studies miss is any real notion of showing the thinking and process behind the work2.Craig Mod has been doing this wonderfully. Nothing braggy or showy. Just showing up and livestreaming the work. Note how the work here is not even client work - but it shows off the range of capabilities wonderfully.6. Find communityEvery indie is already part of 12 slack channels and groups and forums but right now these mutual-aid support communities are more important than ever. These communities are a great place to practice and get feedback on all of these ideas from writing to coping.Community only works when you contribute though - so don’t lurk in 12 slack channels. Instead be active in 3. Find the high value ones you want to engage with and double down.The art of gig newsletter run by Venkat now has a community discord attached to it and is shaping up very nicely if you don’t know where else to go ($5 / month).7. Go subterraneanFinally - if you have the cash reserves to see you through this (big if…) then you should consider going subterranean and working on projects that won’t see the light of day until next year.Side projects might be regenerative for your emotional reserves right now3 but if your client work dries up it’s not the correct response. Take the time to look after yourself then start preparing for the regrowth.If you can cobble together the reserves spend 2020 working on a project that will generate revenue in 2021. Here’s what that might look like for me:Creating a course with full syllabus, videos, materials ready to launch and accept signups next year would be a great investment in future you..If you can invest $X of sweat equity in 2020 you gotta believe those dollars are worth more in 2021….–What other tips and tricks are indies gonna use to stay alive? Post some comments.Stay safe. Much love.            The only blogging I’ve been doing has been “domestic cozy” blogging as a retreat from reality. As Toby says: For three weeks, I have wondered: how much of what I’ve thought and written about on this site is even relevant now? - but Toby concludes there is a way through - urgently and critically through reexamining our core values. Thank you Toby. &#8617;              Yes I know the best case studies do both - but most don’t so don’t @ me. Also - you can only write one case study per work object! You should publish more frequently than that. &#8617;              I actually have a side project cooking right now but I’m firmly positioning this as self-care. It’s not work, and when I’m ready I’m gonna get back to work. &#8617;      "

  "date": "February 20, 2020",
  "content": "It’s no surprise that a single narrative can shape a company’s fate.But it’s just as obvious, though perhaps less talked about, that narrative can also dominate an individuals career path, or a project’s fate.In fact one of the slippery concepts around “narrative” is that it it’s not just confined to “inside the company” or “outside the company” but that these narratives combine and mingle the internal and external realities of companies.I work as an independent consultant and spend a lot of time embedded inside organizations - often co-creating strategy roadmaps with my clients.But clients are people too - and they have narratives, narratives about who they are, narratives about how their markets function and narratives around the strategies they’re creating.And sometimes - as an indie consultant - my work crosses from “consulting” to something that looks more like coaching or advising. For example with a client I’ve been working with for 2 years embedded in their office, we might reach a point where the consulting engagement ends but the executive hiring me keeps me on for “a phone call a week”.And that’s where things get interesting. What is this work?I’m certainly not a qualified executive coach. And during these calls I retain my usual feisty opinionated perspective on my client’s business. But then again - having spent significant time embedded inside the client’s organization I have a ton of context that a traditional advisor wouldn’t understand. I can talk confidently about levels of work, teams and people and strategies with varying levels of abstraction - all the way down the to details.What I’ve come to believe about this “advisory” work is that done well it’s about helping the client shape narratives. What I call: narrative strategyNarrative StrategyWe know strategy is an unfolding network of associations:  The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade.And we know that only 30% of employees can articulate a company’s strategy.And I believe in the hyper-connected age we live in both of these things are becoming more true - that strategy is increasingly “in motion” and that most organizations are realizing their OODA loops are too slow for the modern world.This causes the articulation of strategy to stall and get left behind - how do you articulate something in motion? It’s easier to write strategy down when it doesn’t change right?As a result - there’s a widening gap between the perspective on strategy that the executive team has and the received ideas of the company’s direction that teams and employees have.And this is where narrative strategy comes in. It turns out that serialized writing is the perfect medium for ensuring that strategy “in motion” is articulated, circulated and understood by a greater number of people within the company.Of course - this narrative strategy isn’t confined within the company, much of it can and should bleed out externally.The work of narrative strategy might look like:  Creating new language inside an organization  Naming a project well  Internal blog posts / memos  Creating a cadence of week notes (internal or external)  Blog posts and sharing thinking externally  Crafting conference presentations  Creating compelling job postings  Drafting memos on the state of the industry (again internal or external)And more…The Power of VoiceWhile thought leadership and shaping the narrative has always been important - in today’s digital landscape we’re seeing an increased focus on audience-first brands and founders who can attract outsized communities to their brands. Web Smith calls this the Law of Linear Commerce:  Law of Linear Commerce: for the brands that are most suited to the modern retail economy, media and commerce operations combine to optimize for audience and conversion. This is the efficient path for sustained growth, retention, and profitability.from: 2pm No. 314: On Linear CommerceIt’s increasingly clear to me that a consultant that can help shape the narrative of an organization can have real impact on everything from the brand’s position in culture to the way product teams prioritize and ship features.In this age of audience first brands, smart leaders are realizing the power of writing and the power of creating an ongoing dialogue with the market.And so much of this simply comes down to being able to articulate a position clearly. To write well.Writing, Editorial Coaching &amp; ConsultingThere’s a few (very few!) indie consultants that I know who mix editorial work with narrative strategy. This work is often explicitly supporting executives build, refine and test narrative strategies through writing and publishing.This work is often pitched and sold with some actual writing from the consultant - helping to produce either external thinking and blogging or internal memos and articulation. In one light this is a writing coach / ghostwriter. But through the lens of narrative strategy this work becomes crucial to defining and framing strategy.Toby Shorin writes of his work:  Sometimes I felt like I was doing many different types work, but writing this down, I realized that there’s a common denominator. They largely involved communicating some emerging reality in order to drive specific audience behaviors.  How to develop a new way of seeing? And how to communicate this to stakeholders—users, investors, readers? ​These are not just “marketing” or “brand problems.” In the former cases the primary audience for this work was not the public but internal stakeholders within the client company.  This is also true of the 1-on-1 thought partnership work. Here the goal was to translate macro level thinking, or personal experience, into actionable insights for the client’s audience.  Themes, narratives, metaphors, abstractions. They are tools for understanding. They can be deployed internally to set a vision for the company; they can drive product vision and roadmap; they can be used in sales decks; they can even be used in product interfaces.  For example, it can be powerful to develop different metaphors for explaining your business.[…]  One challenge of our era, if not the defining challenge, is to reach a coherent, actionable understanding of what is happening in our culture. This is always what I have tried to accomplish with my writing, and increasingly this is what I find myself doing in work. Little today is clear. There are still questions to be answered on how to orient to our present situation. This is cultural strategy. There are still questions to be answered on how to forge a compelling, actionable vision of the future. This is narrative strategy.source: Toby ShorinPatrick Tanguay is another exceptional individual who can mix editorial output with narrative strategy - what Patrick calls being a “thought partner” with clients:  Speaking with friends who also do “editorial adjacent” work, I came to realize that when working with small and medium organizations most of us have a direct relationship with the CEO (or perhaps a VP), and we produce largely longer form content usually not seen as marketing. In the process of researching, thinking through, and writing, we end up bringing ideas within the company and influencing its thinking. In some cases this is even done on purpose, not just as a side benefit of writing. Many of us become a kind of “Editor-in-chief of ideas circulating in the organization.”  What I realized is that playing an editorial role for a company and influencing multiple projects and discussions are not two separate things. It’s not “writing things” and “giving opinions because you know about stuff.” A Thought Partner is someone who, through a practice of researching, reading, learning, asking questions, and writing, helps partners in developing their ideas , knowledge, and thinking.source: Thinking About Thought Partnerships – Sentiers MediaConnecting the dots between Toby and Patrick it’s interesting to note how powerful it can be to have an actual writer crafting narrative strategy. I am a hamfisted blogger compared to the eloquence of Toby and Patrick and can only imagine how powerful it would be to hire them for narrative strategy.Articulation is the first productThis form of narrative strategy is especially powerful for early stage companies - and those looking to raise seed / series A money. These companies operate in a grey area where metrics and data aren’t always available. So they rely on narrative to carry them through - narrative with clients and communities and narrative with investors and employees.My friend Brian Dell says it well:  Articulation is the first product. You’ll always need to find better ways to communicate to move your business forward. First, it’ll be to get someone to work with you, then it will be to get someone to help you, then it will be to get someone to use you, then it will be to get someone to invest in you. Understanding that how you articulate your business and needs is as crucial as how you build your business is the first breakthrough we try to make with our founders.I’ve seen indie consultants roll up their sleeves with early stage founders and get involved at everything from corporate comms, brand marketing, blog posts, internal memos and investor pitch decks. The consistent thread through all these activities? Narrative Strategy.So What?To be honest I’m just getting started with this idea of narrative strategy - it’s an emerging form of consulting that looks and feels very different from what I’ve seen before. It combines the talents of a consultant that can excel at writing, editorial and strategy with a market trend that values narrative brands and narrative individuals.Let’s leave with some questions:  How do you sell this kind of work as an indie consultant? Often it’s pitched and sold around the writing component - but it can be hard to charge well enough for this work to see returns.. Can a more formal advisor role be sold effectively here?  Venkatesh Rao talks about “sparring” with clients - is this narrative strategy the training and beginning of true sparring consulting work?  I hear reference to Amazon’s 6-page memo culture every day but have yet to meet a client who actually operates around well-crafted memos. There’s (still!) a large opportunity for executives and leaders inside organizations to capture outsized influence through smart memo writing.  Thought leadership has a mixed reputation - but showing your thinking remains a highly effective marketing strategy. Your most passionate fans/clients/community/recruits will respond well. But too much of this thought leadership ends up trapped in Medium or LinkedIn. What new models can emerge to support thought leadership?Hmm. More to come on this idea…"

For example, it can be powerful to develop different metaphors for explaining your business.[…]  One challenge of our era, if not the defining challenge, is to reach a coherent, actionable understanding of what is happening in our culture. This is always what I have tried to accomplish with my writing, and increasingly this is what I find myself doing in work. Little today is clear. There are still questions to be answered on how to orient to our present situation. This is cultural strategy. There are still questions to be answered on how to forge a compelling, actionable vision of the future. This is narrative strategy.source: Toby ShorinPatrick Tanguay is another exceptional individual who can mix editorial output with narrative strategy - what Patrick calls being a “thought partner” with clients:  Speaking with friends who also do “editorial adjacent” work, I came to realize that when working with small and medium organizations most of us have a direct relationship with the CEO (or perhaps a VP), and we produce largely longer form content usually not seen as marketing. In the process of researching, thinking through, and writing, we end up bringing ideas within the company and influencing its thinking. In some cases this is even done on purpose, not just as a side benefit of writing. Many of us become a kind of “Editor-in-chief of ideas circulating in the organization.”  What I realized is that playing an editorial role for a company and influencing multiple projects and discussions are not two separate things. It’s not “writing things” and “giving opinions because you know about stuff.” A Thought Partner is someone who, through a practice of researching, reading, learning, asking questions, and writing, helps partners in developing their ideas , knowledge, and thinking.source: Thinking About Thought Partnerships – Sentiers MediaConnecting the dots between Toby and Patrick it’s interesting to note how powerful it can be to have an actual writer crafting narrative strategy. I am a hamfisted blogger compared to the eloquence of Toby and Patrick and can only imagine how powerful it would be to hire them for narrative strategy.Articulation is the first productThis form of narrative strategy is especially powerful for early stage companies - and those looking to raise seed / series A money. These companies operate in a grey area where metrics and data aren’t always available. So they rely on narrative to carry them through - narrative with clients and communities and narrative with investors and employees.My friend Brian Dell says it well:  Articulation is the first product. You’ll always need to find better ways to communicate to move your business forward. First, it’ll be to get someone to work with you, then it will be to get someone to help you, then it will be to get someone to use you, then it will be to get someone to invest in you. Understanding that how you articulate your business and needs is as crucial as how you build your business is the first breakthrough we try to make with our founders.I’ve seen indie consultants roll up their sleeves with early stage founders and get involved at everything from corporate comms, brand marketing, blog posts, internal memos and investor pitch decks. The consistent thread through all these activities? Narrative Strategy.So What?To be honest I’m just getting started with this idea of narrative strategy - it’s an emerging form of consulting that looks and feels very different from what I’ve seen before. It combines the talents of a consultant that can excel at writing, editorial and strategy with a market trend that values narrative brands and narrative individuals.Let’s leave with some questions:  How do you sell this kind of work as an indie consultant? Often it’s pitched and sold around the writing component - but it can be hard to charge well enough for this work to see returns.. Can a more formal advisor role be sold effectively here?  Venkatesh Rao talks about “sparring” with clients - is this narrative strategy the training and beginning of true sparring consulting work?  I hear reference to Amazon’s 6-page memo culture every day but have yet to meet a client who actually operates around well-crafted memos. There’s (still!) a large opportunity for executives and leaders inside organizations to capture outsized influence through smart memo writing.  Thought leadership has a mixed reputation - but showing your thinking remains a highly effective marketing strategy. Your most passionate fans/clients/community/recruits will respond well. But too much of this thought leadership ends up trapped in Medium or LinkedIn. What new models can emerge to support thought leadership?Hmm. More to come on this idea…"

  "title": "Blocking & Unblocking Clients",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/",
  "date": "December 6, 2019",
  "content": "This post is part 3 of the Yes! And… series. Catch up on Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.Good strategy sessions, like good improv sessions, are a product of multiple actors working together to build scenes collaboratively. Typically, however, we spend more time thinking about how to craft good strategies than we do thinking about how to create productive strategy sparring sessions.This reflects a core misunderstanding of what strategy is.Strategy is not a single point in time powerpoint deck. Good strategy is an unfolding network of associations throughout an organization. And the unit of progress for the consultant is often the sparring session with the client.As I reflect back on the most effective consulting engagements I’ve worked on it’s the ones where I was able to build a strong improv reflex with my client and where we had arrived at a Yes! And… mindset between us - enabling us to co-create strategy with little regard for ego.But to get there requires deliberate work to unblock clients, in fact to realize that often the consultant is the one blocking the client! (I’ve certainly been guilty of this.)And the output? Usually the most ordinary of strategies that simply make deliberate movement towards important new capacities.Let’s start with the most basic improv technique of them all…Use “Yes! And…” to stop yourself blocking clientsThe first and most basic tool you learn in improv acting is the Yes! And… exercise - it helps actors be more creative and flow better through the process of opening up, not closing down.The principle is simple and hinges on accepting your partner’s ideas and building on top of them instead of closing them down. “Yes! And…” is the simple phrase to remember but not every sentence has to literally start that way.This concept is deeply ingrained in my consulting work.When working with clients there’s a tendency for consultants (especially newer consultants that are less confident) to place a primacy on their own ideas, to “have the answers” and also to believe too strongly in their own approach - and in the process block the client from expressing their ideas.At heart, the idea of yes and is about accepting the gambit from another actor and building on top of it - of opening up the world through the lens that they have offered and not attempting to close down their world and open your own - and spoiler alert, this is an effective approach to consulting!Example: I remember consulting for The Wirecutter years ago (before they were acquired by the NYT) and attempting to convince them that they should create product review pages alongside their category pages1. I distinctly remember a conversation that went something like:  Me: There is a big opportunity in expanding into product review pages  Wirecutter: But our brand is built on only doing these category reviews  Me: But, you’re missing out on so much traffic  Wirecutter: We only know how to do category reviews  Me: You already have the content for these review pages!  [Here we are blocked and the conversation is going nowhere]Instead, let’s imagine a conversation like this:  Me: There is a big opportunity in expanding into product review pages  Wirecutter: But our brand is built on only doing these category reviews  Me: We’re excellent at doing those. Are there instances where the category reviews don’t work?  Wirecutter: Hmm well in emerging categories where there isn’t a category but a single defining product for example Peleton is it’s own category and not really compared to anything  Me: Yes! And do you think we could use our expertise in category reviews to provide reviews in these categories?  [Here the client is engaged and ready to accept a new way of doing things]This conversation is obviously both made up and exaggerated but hopefully it demonstrates the premise of opening up the client to new ideas through accepting their prompts and building from them rather than trying to block their ideas to talk about your own.This approach relies on two powerful ideas - firstly that everyone (clients &amp; consultants included!) want their ideas to be listened to2 and that using the Yes! And… conversation as a tool ends up with a co-created strategy.The Power (&amp; Limits) of Co-creating StrategyThis Yes! And… mindset quickly leads to a generative strategy situation where the ideas, strategies and projects are co-created between the client and consultant.I imagine a “branching” visualization like this (blue for client, green for consultant):As I talk about in my frameworks post the co-creation process allows for more crucial client context to be part of the strategy (i.e. it’s more true) and it allows for more ownership from the client (i.e. the IKEA effect).Example: Continuing the Wirecutter conversation above you can see how we’re already folding in more of the client context into the strategy and we’re already co-creating vs me (the consultant) just telling the client what to do. This process will better uncover exactly why these category reviews are part of their company DNA or more concrete examples of missed opportunities from not publishing stand alone review pages. This co-creation ultimately creates a shared vision of how we might move forward.Of course - let’s get real for a moment the theatre of work and all this talk of improv only goes so far. You can’t keep building and bridging forever - and sometimes clients are simply going in the wrong direction.So it’s useful to understand the situations where Yes! And… is most useful and powerful. The answer is at the start of the engagement or session to establish a base reality:  Upright Citizens Brigade improvisational theory suggests that Yes And is only the most important tool to an improviser at the beginning of scenes, when they are obligated to establish a Base Reality. Yes And, in this view, expedites the process of finding a Who, What, and Where for the scene, allowing a context to solidify on top of which an absurd element can be found. - sourceI like this idea - that the most useful thing you need client input and co-creation on is the “base reality” - the “Who, What, Where”. For consultants coming in from the outside attempting to “solve problems” for clients the biggest flaw in generic strategies is not properly accounting for who is at the company, what we’re actually trying to solve and where this strategy will play out3.And this can be useful because clients can ramble - they can get wrapped up in their arguments. This is no pejorative statement but rather just a function of how much time clients typically devote to “strategy” and improv thinking.So the Yes! And… exercise can be powerful for co-creating strategy with clients accounting for their particular expertise and wisdom around the base reality of who, what where.Example: in chapter two I illustrated a client where we have a shared joke for SEO consultants that come in and attempt to to improve content quality without appropriately understanding the base reality of content quantity being part of their cultural DNA. Of course early in the engagement I too was that SEO consultant coming in talking of content quality! Thankfully a keen intuitive sense of co-creating strategy with clients and opening up their ideas (rather than closing them down) led us to a place where we could get more nuanced and realistic around the quality/quantity ecosystem.Of note here is that clients often have a very keen intuitive sense of their specific market - while often failing to properly draw analogies from other markets that they are less familiar with. Helping clients understand adjacent and oblique markets can really aid their own generated strategies.So long as the foundations are co-created with the client the consultant is then free to build on them with their own ideas and point of view.All of this, however, relies on being able to get clients to a comfortable Yes! And… mode in the first place. This co-creation process feels a lot like an improv session (or a series of sessions) and good improv requires two (or more) actors! Unfortunately, I sometimes find that clients are like blocked actors.They have been trained to shut down their open-world generative side and they need coaxing and coaching to open up.Unblocking Clients &amp; Original StrategyBlocked clients are frustrating and confusing to work with - partly because it’s very difficult to disentangle your own presence from them being blocked and partly because you quickly hit personal bias, emotional ideas and feelings of identity and security….Here there be dragons.Some of the ways I’ve encountered blocked clients:  Clients that expect you to “have the answers” because you’re expensive  Clients who aren’t confident in their own position in the org chart  Clients who have poor mental models of how their own teams work  Clients who block because they’re uncomfortable “doing strategy work”  Clients who block ideas by pre-emptively anticipating feedback from other execs  Clients who block as a way of exerting high status  Clients who are trying to set strategy by copying a competitor  Clients who look for strategies that will make them culturally relevant or interesting4For all of these situations, Impro has delightful and rich ideas to help you coach actors into unblocking themselves. The book is very much about how to teach people to unblock themselves - which again is valuable for a consultant.Many of these can be mitigated or helped through a default optimistic and positive attitude and mindset as outlined in chapter 2 - optimism as an operating system. Remember the powerful phrase “this is a solvable problem”.Let’s take a look at one specific situation that I see a lot however and that Impro has a particularly good solution for - the situation where a client expects original strategy or clever strategy from the consultant. From Impro:  Originality  Many students block their imaginations because they’re afraid of being unoriginal. They believe they know exactly what originality is, just as critics are always sure they can recognise things that are avant-garde.  We have a concept of originality based on things that already exist. I’m told that avant-garde theatre groups in Japan are just like those in the West — well of course, or how would we know what they were? Anyone can run an avant-garde theatre group ; you just get the actors to lie naked in heaps or outstare the audience, or move in extreme slow motion, or whatever the fashion is. But the real avant-garde aren’t imitating what other people are doing, or what they did forty years ago; they’re solving the problems that need solving, like how to get a popular theatre with some worth-while content, and they may not look avant-garde at all !  The improviser has to realise that the more obvious he is, the more original he appears. I constantly point out how much the audience like someone who is direct, and how they always laugh with pleasure at a really ‘obvious’ idea. Ordinary people asked to improvise will search for some ‘original’ idea because they want to be thought clever.  They’ll say and do all sorts of inappropriate things. If someone says ‘What’s for supper?’ a bad improviser will desperately try to think up something original. Whatever he says he’ll be too slow. He’ll finally drag up some idea like ‘fried mermaid’. If he’d just said ‘fish’5 the audience would have been delighted.Hopefully it’s obvious how painfully relevant this is for the client who expects “original” or “clever” strategy. The simple “fish” strategy is usually the right answer - and clients that expect extravagant or over-engineered strategies are actually blocking the consultant.Impro has valuable insights and strategies here - and the good news / bad news is that the most effective way to unblock clients here is simple and hard: have them experience good improv.The book walks through exercises and ideas for coaching actors into new ways of thinking and explaining the power of overcoming insecurity, overcoming trying to be original, overcoming status issues and so much more.Of course, the best way to open up is through keeping this Yes! And… refrain in mind - it reminds me to keep the positive edge and optimism. There are no bad ideas! Blocked clients often don’t realize they’re blocking!It keeps you in the beginner’s mind of accepting that the client knows their business better than you do - so you push them to generate new directions themselves rather than providing them “answers” of what to do.And in fact “answers” and “solutions” are not really what we’re being hired for anyway…Take a Hard Look in the MirrorAll of this talk of blocked clients however misses something important - in my own work, 80% of the time when you feel the client is blocked - it is you the consultant that is blocking the client!The consultant’s ego places a high value on your own ideas - you want to be the hero that has the “right” answers. And in fact you can feel like a fraud if you work on a consulting project where you don’t have any original ideas.This thinking will lead you into trouble.Instead - remember that mostly there is no “correct” strategy and strategy is certainly not a stable idea - it’s an unfolding network of ideas. I love this quote from Stripe Partners:  The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade. - source: strategy is an unfolding network of associationsIn my experience when you feel a client is blocked the most useful default response is to move out of the way!Look for ways to bridge from the client’s ideas to new directions that are only slightly divergent and position you to unfold into a correct strategy later on. This can be paradoxical to begin with (how can I feel good about helping the client go in the wrong direction?) but in fact the most useful thing you can provide the client is forward motion and momentum.Shaping the strategy when it’s “in-motion” is much easier than blocking and shaping the strategy from a standing start.In fact - we can extend this idea further. There is no right or wrong strategy. Most consulting projects have nothing to do with solving problems - instead they’re all about building new capacities…Consultant as Capacity BuilderIn Chapter 2 we looked at client organizations as ecosystems in balance. Even if we adopt Yes! And… ideas and co-create strategies with our clients there will be a gap between the strategies on paper and the strategies in reality.To this end, it’s important to understand the type of consultant that you’re trying to be: a “problem solver” or a “capacity builder”This wonderful piece sums up the two mental models:  Consultants are ideally capacity builders who develop links between research and practice rather than problem solvers. They provide methods and tools to help others expand their capabilities and skills on an ongoing basis, thereby transforming concepts into practical know-how and results. These consultants may have knowledge in a variety of areas, but the contribution they make is framed as building capacity for learning and interpersonal connections rather than providing expertise.They go on to identify four core mental models that separate problem solvers and capacity builders:Much like when I stumbled across “strategy &amp; stewardship” this concept of “capacity building vs problem solving” gives language to something I’ve known intuitively for a long time.It’s going to be foundational to my thinking about consulting and I suggest you give this a close read: Consultants as problem solvers or capacity builders?I’d go one step beyond this article however to argue that there are no problems inside organizations - a problem is just a point between two systems! (as per Chapter 2).There are no problem solutions without building new capacities…Build New Capacities by Interrupting RoutinesFor consultants that are embracing the nature of co-creating strategy and where we are aiming to build new capacities the central problem of consulting then becomes:How do we help clients move out of the status quo to do new things? And where will the resources for these new things come from?Let’s turn to Impro for inspiration again… Here’s Keith on the power of interrupting routines:  If I say ‘Make up a story’, then most people are paralysed. If I say ‘describe a routine and then interrupt it’, people see no problem. A film like The Last Detail is based on the routine of two sailors travelling across America with a prisoner whom they have to deliver to a prison. The routine is interrupted by their decision to give him a good time. The story I fantasised earlier about the bear who chased me was presumably an interruption of the routine ‘Walking through the forest’. Red Riding Hood presents an interruption of the routine ‘Taking a basket of goodies to Grandma’. Many people think of finding more interesting routines, which doesn’t solve the problem.  It may be interesting to have a vet rectally examining an elephant, or to show brain surgeons doing a particularly delicate operation, but these activities remain routines. If two lavatory attendants break a routine by starting a brain operation, or if a window cleaner begins to examine the elephant, then this is likely to generate a narrative. Conversely, two brain surgeons working as lavatory cleaners immediately sounds like part of a story. If I describe mountaineers climbing a mountain, then the routine says that they first climb it, and then they climb down, which isn’t much of a story. A film of a mountain climb isn’t necessarily anything more than a documentary.While this might seem less relevant for business contexts - this paralyzed reaction to “make up a story” is exactly the same as many employees and teams when faced with a question of “doing a new thing” (i.e. building a new capacity).Further - employees and teams are heavily incentivized to maintain the status quo. Even if it’s made clear the importance of doing something new their muscle memory is built around maintaining and optimizing the status quo…The trick is in interrupting routines. And there’s a good way and a bad way to do that.The bad way to interrupt routines is through a deliberate intervention - something like an off-site. This forcibly removes people from the environment usually for a day or two of “blue sky thinking” and “brainstorming”. There is a time and a place for them but mostly off-sites will allow for new ways of thinking but not new ways of doing.Rather - the better way to interrupt routines is via a thorough understanding of existing workflows, processes and routines6. Most new capacities relate to an existing routine either directly or indirectly and the job of the consultant is to map the organization effectively to understand where and how we can interrupt to build new routines.Example: let’s return to that Wirecutter example to see how the idea of “growing organic traffic” translates into a co-created strategy for “experimenting with review pages”. So how? With what resource? Here the idea of interrupting routines is useful. Once you clearly understand how the workflow of research -&gt; planning - &gt; publishing works at a company like The Wirecutter you would be able to identify parts of the research &amp; planning routines that can be interrupted with new data or new insights to enable the teams to look at publishing review pages when the opportunities emerges from the data.The trick is not to get new capacities off the ground from a standing start but to interrupt routines to get new capacities built “in-flow” of existing teams and workflows.This “just in time” strategy of hijacking an existing routines in-flow and re-directing some portion of it into a new capacity experiment is way easier than getting a new process kicked off from a standing start.Getting new capacities off the ground from scratch requires a herculean effort and while this is good for the ego complex of the consultant - as they imagine themselves moving mountains and molding the organization like clay - the truth is that our job is not to change the organization but to help the organization change themselves…ConclusionAs I reflect back on the most effective consulting engagements I’ve worked on it’s the ones where I was able to build a strong improv reflex with my client and where we had arrived at a Yes! And… mindset between us - enabling us to co-create strategy with little regard for ego.And the output? Usually the most ordinary of strategies that simply make deliberate movement towards important new capacities.Up next in the Yes! And… series we look at a new skill consultants need to learn: status switching.            They have actually started doing this relatively recently post-NYT acquisition. See example here: peleton review &#8617;              Listening could in fact turn out to be the ultimate consulting skill…. &#8617;              Recall from chapter 2 - there is no ‘just’ in consulting - clients are ecosystems in balance… &#8617;              Toby Shorin has a great insight around this in this twitter thread &#8617;              Look at your fish! is a good reference here for the power in un-original things… &#8617;              I’m reminded of the phrase amateurs talk strategy, experts talk logistics here. &#8617;      "

  "content": "This post is part 3 of the Yes! And… series. Catch up on Chapter 1 and Chapter 2.Good strategy sessions, like good improv sessions, are a product of multiple actors working together to build scenes collaboratively. Typically, however, we spend more time thinking about how to craft good strategies than we do thinking about how to create productive strategy sparring sessions.This reflects a core misunderstanding of what strategy is.Strategy is not a single point in time powerpoint deck. Good strategy is an unfolding network of associations throughout an organization. And the unit of progress for the consultant is often the sparring session with the client.As I reflect back on the most effective consulting engagements I’ve worked on it’s the ones where I was able to build a strong improv reflex with my client and where we had arrived at a Yes! And… mindset between us - enabling us to co-create strategy with little regard for ego.But to get there requires deliberate work to unblock clients, in fact to realize that often the consultant is the one blocking the client! (I’ve certainly been guilty of this.)And the output? Usually the most ordinary of strategies that simply make deliberate movement towards important new capacities.Let’s start with the most basic improv technique of them all…Use “Yes! And…” to stop yourself blocking clientsThe first and most basic tool you learn in improv acting is the Yes! And… exercise - it helps actors be more creative and flow better through the process of opening up, not closing down.The principle is simple and hinges on accepting your partner’s ideas and building on top of them instead of closing them down. “Yes! And…” is the simple phrase to remember but not every sentence has to literally start that way.This concept is deeply ingrained in my consulting work.When working with clients there’s a tendency for consultants (especially newer consultants that are less confident) to place a primacy on their own ideas, to “have the answers” and also to believe too strongly in their own approach - and in the process block the client from expressing their ideas.At heart, the idea of yes and is about accepting the gambit from another actor and building on top of it - of opening up the world through the lens that they have offered and not attempting to close down their world and open your own - and spoiler alert, this is an effective approach to consulting!Example: I remember consulting for The Wirecutter years ago (before they were acquired by the NYT) and attempting to convince them that they should create product review pages alongside their category pages1. I distinctly remember a conversation that went something like:  Me: There is a big opportunity in expanding into product review pages  Wirecutter: But our brand is built on only doing these category reviews  Me: But, you’re missing out on so much traffic  Wirecutter: We only know how to do category reviews  Me: You already have the content for these review pages!  [Here we are blocked and the conversation is going nowhere]Instead, let’s imagine a conversation like this:  Me: There is a big opportunity in expanding into product review pages  Wirecutter: But our brand is built on only doing these category reviews  Me: We’re excellent at doing those. Are there instances where the category reviews don’t work?  Wirecutter: Hmm well in emerging categories where there isn’t a category but a single defining product for example Peleton is it’s own category and not really compared to anything  Me: Yes! And do you think we could use our expertise in category reviews to provide reviews in these categories?  [Here the client is engaged and ready to accept a new way of doing things]This conversation is obviously both made up and exaggerated but hopefully it demonstrates the premise of opening up the client to new ideas through accepting their prompts and building from them rather than trying to block their ideas to talk about your own.This approach relies on two powerful ideas - firstly that everyone (clients &amp; consultants included!) want their ideas to be listened to2 and that using the Yes! And… conversation as a tool ends up with a co-created strategy.The Power (&amp; Limits) of Co-creating StrategyThis Yes! And… mindset quickly leads to a generative strategy situation where the ideas, strategies and projects are co-created between the client and consultant.I imagine a “branching” visualization like this (blue for client, green for consultant):As I talk about in my frameworks post the co-creation process allows for more crucial client context to be part of the strategy (i.e. it’s more true) and it allows for more ownership from the client (i.e. the IKEA effect).Example: Continuing the Wirecutter conversation above you can see how we’re already folding in more of the client context into the strategy and we’re already co-creating vs me (the consultant) just telling the client what to do. This process will better uncover exactly why these category reviews are part of their company DNA or more concrete examples of missed opportunities from not publishing stand alone review pages. This co-creation ultimately creates a shared vision of how we might move forward.Of course - let’s get real for a moment the theatre of work and all this talk of improv only goes so far. You can’t keep building and bridging forever - and sometimes clients are simply going in the wrong direction.So it’s useful to understand the situations where Yes! And… is most useful and powerful. The answer is at the start of the engagement or session to establish a base reality:  Upright Citizens Brigade improvisational theory suggests that Yes And is only the most important tool to an improviser at the beginning of scenes, when they are obligated to establish a Base Reality. Yes And, in this view, expedites the process of finding a Who, What, and Where for the scene, allowing a context to solidify on top of which an absurd element can be found. - sourceI like this idea - that the most useful thing you need client input and co-creation on is the “base reality” - the “Who, What, Where”. For consultants coming in from the outside attempting to “solve problems” for clients the biggest flaw in generic strategies is not properly accounting for who is at the company, what we’re actually trying to solve and where this strategy will play out3.And this can be useful because clients can ramble - they can get wrapped up in their arguments. This is no pejorative statement but rather just a function of how much time clients typically devote to “strategy” and improv thinking.So the Yes! And… exercise can be powerful for co-creating strategy with clients accounting for their particular expertise and wisdom around the base reality of who, what where.Example: in chapter two I illustrated a client where we have a shared joke for SEO consultants that come in and attempt to to improve content quality without appropriately understanding the base reality of content quantity being part of their cultural DNA. Of course early in the engagement I too was that SEO consultant coming in talking of content quality! Thankfully a keen intuitive sense of co-creating strategy with clients and opening up their ideas (rather than closing them down) led us to a place where we could get more nuanced and realistic around the quality/quantity ecosystem.Of note here is that clients often have a very keen intuitive sense of their specific market - while often failing to properly draw analogies from other markets that they are less familiar with. Helping clients understand adjacent and oblique markets can really aid their own generated strategies.So long as the foundations are co-created with the client the consultant is then free to build on them with their own ideas and point of view.All of this, however, relies on being able to get clients to a comfortable Yes! And… mode in the first place. This co-creation process feels a lot like an improv session (or a series of sessions) and good improv requires two (or more) actors! Unfortunately, I sometimes find that clients are like blocked actors.They have been trained to shut down their open-world generative side and they need coaxing and coaching to open up.Unblocking Clients &amp; Original StrategyBlocked clients are frustrating and confusing to work with - partly because it’s very difficult to disentangle your own presence from them being blocked and partly because you quickly hit personal bias, emotional ideas and feelings of identity and security….Here there be dragons.Some of the ways I’ve encountered blocked clients:  Clients that expect you to “have the answers” because you’re expensive  Clients who aren’t confident in their own position in the org chart  Clients who have poor mental models of how their own teams work  Clients who block because they’re uncomfortable “doing strategy work”  Clients who block ideas by pre-emptively anticipating feedback from other execs  Clients who block as a way of exerting high status  Clients who are trying to set strategy by copying a competitor  Clients who look for strategies that will make them culturally relevant or interesting4For all of these situations, Impro has delightful and rich ideas to help you coach actors into unblocking themselves. The book is very much about how to teach people to unblock themselves - which again is valuable for a consultant.Many of these can be mitigated or helped through a default optimistic and positive attitude and mindset as outlined in chapter 2 - optimism as an operating system. Remember the powerful phrase “this is a solvable problem”.Let’s take a look at one specific situation that I see a lot however and that Impro has a particularly good solution for - the situation where a client expects original strategy or clever strategy from the consultant. From Impro:  Originality  Many students block their imaginations because they’re afraid of being unoriginal. They believe they know exactly what originality is, just as critics are always sure they can recognise things that are avant-garde.  We have a concept of originality based on things that already exist. I’m told that avant-garde theatre groups in Japan are just like those in the West — well of course, or how would we know what they were? Anyone can run an avant-garde theatre group ; you just get the actors to lie naked in heaps or outstare the audience, or move in extreme slow motion, or whatever the fashion is. But the real avant-garde aren’t imitating what other people are doing, or what they did forty years ago; they’re solving the problems that need solving, like how to get a popular theatre with some worth-while content, and they may not look avant-garde at all !  The improviser has to realise that the more obvious he is, the more original he appears. I constantly point out how much the audience like someone who is direct, and how they always laugh with pleasure at a really ‘obvious’ idea. Ordinary people asked to improvise will search for some ‘original’ idea because they want to be thought clever.  They’ll say and do all sorts of inappropriate things. If someone says ‘What’s for supper?’ a bad improviser will desperately try to think up something original. Whatever he says he’ll be too slow. He’ll finally drag up some idea like ‘fried mermaid’. If he’d just said ‘fish’5 the audience would have been delighted.Hopefully it’s obvious how painfully relevant this is for the client who expects “original” or “clever” strategy. The simple “fish” strategy is usually the right answer - and clients that expect extravagant or over-engineered strategies are actually blocking the consultant.Impro has valuable insights and strategies here - and the good news / bad news is that the most effective way to unblock clients here is simple and hard: have them experience good improv.The book walks through exercises and ideas for coaching actors into new ways of thinking and explaining the power of overcoming insecurity, overcoming trying to be original, overcoming status issues and so much more.Of course, the best way to open up is through keeping this Yes! And… refrain in mind - it reminds me to keep the positive edge and optimism. There are no bad ideas! Blocked clients often don’t realize they’re blocking!It keeps you in the beginner’s mind of accepting that the client knows their business better than you do - so you push them to generate new directions themselves rather than providing them “answers” of what to do.And in fact “answers” and “solutions” are not really what we’re being hired for anyway…Take a Hard Look in the MirrorAll of this talk of blocked clients however misses something important - in my own work, 80% of the time when you feel the client is blocked - it is you the consultant that is blocking the client!The consultant’s ego places a high value on your own ideas - you want to be the hero that has the “right” answers. And in fact you can feel like a fraud if you work on a consulting project where you don’t have any original ideas.This thinking will lead you into trouble.Instead - remember that mostly there is no “correct” strategy and strategy is certainly not a stable idea - it’s an unfolding network of ideas. I love this quote from Stripe Partners:  The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade. - source: strategy is an unfolding network of associationsIn my experience when you feel a client is blocked the most useful default response is to move out of the way!Look for ways to bridge from the client’s ideas to new directions that are only slightly divergent and position you to unfold into a correct strategy later on. This can be paradoxical to begin with (how can I feel good about helping the client go in the wrong direction?) but in fact the most useful thing you can provide the client is forward motion and momentum.Shaping the strategy when it’s “in-motion” is much easier than blocking and shaping the strategy from a standing start.In fact - we can extend this idea further. There is no right or wrong strategy. Most consulting projects have nothing to do with solving problems - instead they’re all about building new capacities…Consultant as Capacity BuilderIn Chapter 2 we looked at client organizations as ecosystems in balance. Even if we adopt Yes! And… ideas and co-create strategies with our clients there will be a gap between the strategies on paper and the strategies in reality.To this end, it’s important to understand the type of consultant that you’re trying to be: a “problem solver” or a “capacity builder”This wonderful piece sums up the two mental models:  Consultants are ideally capacity builders who develop links between research and practice rather than problem solvers. They provide methods and tools to help others expand their capabilities and skills on an ongoing basis, thereby transforming concepts into practical know-how and results. These consultants may have knowledge in a variety of areas, but the contribution they make is framed as building capacity for learning and interpersonal connections rather than providing expertise.They go on to identify four core mental models that separate problem solvers and capacity builders:Much like when I stumbled across “strategy &amp; stewardship” this concept of “capacity building vs problem solving” gives language to something I’ve known intuitively for a long time.It’s going to be foundational to my thinking about consulting and I suggest you give this a close read: Consultants as problem solvers or capacity builders?I’d go one step beyond this article however to argue that there are no problems inside organizations - a problem is just a point between two systems! (as per Chapter 2).There are no problem solutions without building new capacities…Build New Capacities by Interrupting RoutinesFor consultants that are embracing the nature of co-creating strategy and where we are aiming to build new capacities the central problem of consulting then becomes:How do we help clients move out of the status quo to do new things? And where will the resources for these new things come from?Let’s turn to Impro for inspiration again… Here’s Keith on the power of interrupting routines:  If I say ‘Make up a story’, then most people are paralysed. If I say ‘describe a routine and then interrupt it’, people see no problem. A film like The Last Detail is based on the routine of two sailors travelling across America with a prisoner whom they have to deliver to a prison. The routine is interrupted by their decision to give him a good time. The story I fantasised earlier about the bear who chased me was presumably an interruption of the routine ‘Walking through the forest’. Red Riding Hood presents an interruption of the routine ‘Taking a basket of goodies to Grandma’. Many people think of finding more interesting routines, which doesn’t solve the problem.  It may be interesting to have a vet rectally examining an elephant, or to show brain surgeons doing a particularly delicate operation, but these activities remain routines. If two lavatory attendants break a routine by starting a brain operation, or if a window cleaner begins to examine the elephant, then this is likely to generate a narrative. Conversely, two brain surgeons working as lavatory cleaners immediately sounds like part of a story. If I describe mountaineers climbing a mountain, then the routine says that they first climb it, and then they climb down, which isn’t much of a story. A film of a mountain climb isn’t necessarily anything more than a documentary.While this might seem less relevant for business contexts - this paralyzed reaction to “make up a story” is exactly the same as many employees and teams when faced with a question of “doing a new thing” (i.e. building a new capacity).Further - employees and teams are heavily incentivized to maintain the status quo. Even if it’s made clear the importance of doing something new their muscle memory is built around maintaining and optimizing the status quo…The trick is in interrupting routines. And there’s a good way and a bad way to do that.The bad way to interrupt routines is through a deliberate intervention - something like an off-site. This forcibly removes people from the environment usually for a day or two of “blue sky thinking” and “brainstorming”. There is a time and a place for them but mostly off-sites will allow for new ways of thinking but not new ways of doing.Rather - the better way to interrupt routines is via a thorough understanding of existing workflows, processes and routines6. Most new capacities relate to an existing routine either directly or indirectly and the job of the consultant is to map the organization effectively to understand where and how we can interrupt to build new routines.Example: let’s return to that Wirecutter example to see how the idea of “growing organic traffic” translates into a co-created strategy for “experimenting with review pages”. So how? With what resource? Here the idea of interrupting routines is useful. Once you clearly understand how the workflow of research -&gt; planning - &gt; publishing works at a company like The Wirecutter you would be able to identify parts of the research &amp; planning routines that can be interrupted with new data or new insights to enable the teams to look at publishing review pages when the opportunities emerges from the data.The trick is not to get new capacities off the ground from a standing start but to interrupt routines to get new capacities built “in-flow” of existing teams and workflows.This “just in time” strategy of hijacking an existing routines in-flow and re-directing some portion of it into a new capacity experiment is way easier than getting a new process kicked off from a standing start.Getting new capacities off the ground from scratch requires a herculean effort and while this is good for the ego complex of the consultant - as they imagine themselves moving mountains and molding the organization like clay - the truth is that our job is not to change the organization but to help the organization change themselves…ConclusionAs I reflect back on the most effective consulting engagements I’ve worked on it’s the ones where I was able to build a strong improv reflex with my client and where we had arrived at a Yes!

  "content": "This is part 2 in a 5-part series called Yes! And… - exploring the relationship between the theatre of work, the consultant as improv actor and the generative positivity of Yes! And… Catch up on chapter 1 here.The consultant thrives on problems. Things to be “fixed”, “solved” and “improved”. As a result it can be natural to take pleasure in identifying problems. That smell of a fresh client - waiting to be carved up by sharp 2x2s. A client with problems is a good client for a consultant.And yet…If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.Instead it’s crucial to ignore that gleeful feeling that comes from recognizing problems and force yourself to identify the systems that are working - to embrace the strengths of an organization first.Remember - consulting is humans all the way down - no client wants to bring in a negative, critical or attacking consultant. And no team wants to listen to a consultant that “has a better way of doing things”.The sweet-spot (especially in the first few months of an engagement) is identifying the existing flows, biases and strengths of a client so that you can move with them, not against them. Go with the grain1.Why is this so important? Because if you want to work with an organization for a long time and make a difference, people need to like having you around. Sure, you need to be effective but I’d contend equally, if not more important, is to be a pleasure to work with.The Critical PathHere are some of the problems you might face if you take an overly critical or negative eye:Diagnosing problems without solutions - causing the organization to slow down.Short term engagements that feel productive but don’t last.Culture clash problems with team members at the client’s organization.Creating strategy that sounds good but fails to get implemented.Exhausting clients and client teams with a feeling of urgency and crisis.It can be tempting in particular to treat the work you’re doing with a client as critical. It’s helpful to think this way because it inflates the ego and helps you charge well.But the truth is that if you’re designing for retained work (and you should be) then you will exhaust the teams you’re working with and challenge the status of the executive team. No client wants to be in long-term crisis.Instead - while it may seem counterintuitive the right answer is to downplay the importance of your work. To place the work within a context of comfort. The strongest language you have as a consultant is:“this is a solvable problem”The most successful projects are those where you can build routine solutions to important problems.This provides a sense to the client of competence, of bringing calm to otherwise high-pressure situations and of reminding them that this may take a while to solve!Back-stage in the Theatre of WorkIt can be tempting as a consultant to keep a serious mask on at all times. You might be getting paid an hourly rate that certainly makes you feel all serious and grown up…And yet - it’s humans all the way down and if you want to be effective in the theatre of work you need to recognize and participate in both the front-stage and back-stage environments of a client’s office.Front-stage is loosely defined as “more professional contexts” i.e. meetings, conversations about work directly etc. The Back-stage is loosely defined as “less professional contexts” i.e. the kitchen, breakroom, etc.It can be tempting as a consultant to avoid the back-stage area. Crude humor and letting off steam is a dangerous place for an outsider - and yet if you don’t engage you risk becoming “the outsider” yourself:  Embedded in, arising from and flowing through many of the routines and rituals of professional life, the stream of humour is one of its most distinctive features, providing not only a source of enrichment and nourishment but also serving as a defining characteristic of the territory as represented by its inhabitants.And, just because the back-stage is less formal than the front-stage it’s no less important for real work:  the characteristics of the back region make possible a creative redefinition of professional experience that is achieved through humour and stories. Talking about professional encounters is the stuff of the back region, but it would be a mistake to assume that such talk is trivial simply because of the context in which it occurs: serious business does not necessarily have to be done seriously.Both of these quotes come from the book Language and Professional Identity which is a gem and worth consuming entirely if the study of language interests you2. Combined with my own experience I’ll highlight some ways to think about the back-stage:  Show up in the back-stage of the theatre some-times but not all times. It’s important to give teams the opportunity to retain their identity and you shouldn’t overwhelm them.  Join the humor and crack jokes but keep them middle road - don’t stretch to the edgy humor even if others are, politely decline to be outlandish.  Be incredibly careful with aiming your jokes at any part of the organization - you never know which team or function may become an important part of your work next.  Listen carefully to where humor spills over into showing people’s real frustration and bias with teams, work, executives and organizations. Humor is a strong signal.Positivity &amp; Long Term RetainersHere’s a fun anecdote - I once worked with a client for a long time, in their office every week. After a while I was growing disappointed that I had not had much impact - that I’d not “gotten much done”. When in fact it came to light that the primary reason I was there was to be excited, positive and enthusiastic. The client was trying to do a “new thing” and they recognized that this was hard.Instead they valued the energy, enthusiasm and visibility I was giving to the problem. At times I felt like a puppy consultant - running around the office being excited about things.This engagement helped me realize that there is a value to positivity - that bringing energy and enthusiasm to an organization is worth something, entirely independent of the results and outcomes you’re working on!Although clients will rarely pay for it directly there is value in changing the energy and changing the conversation in an organization. These are precursors to real change. And if you provide this level of positivity and optimism then clients will keep you around irrespective of your “impact”.It’s hard to quantify but I believe this default optimism has helped me stick around for long-term retainers with clients time and time again.So, how do you retain this positive attitude in the face of clients not embracing your changes, resisting new things and generally moving slower than you’d like?On client frustration and the word “just…”It’s important to understand that there is no “just…” in the consultant’s vocabulary.Every business is a balanced system - their strengths and successes are not despite their flaws but because of their flaws.I love this quote: “a problem is a point between two complex systems”3.So, to reframe our initial statement about problems - the key when engaging clients is not to hunt for problems but to hunt for systems.It took me a long time to learn this - that strengths and weaknesses are not in opposition to each other but rather they are in symbiosis.Ah - so tread carefully young consultant. The levers you want to pull are all connected.This is why the initial glee at a client full of “problems” quickly turns to frustration - because it turns out that those initial “problems” were just the other side of the coin for the client’s strengths.Example: I have a client I’ve been working with for three years. We have a running joke that every time they engage a new SEO consultant the advice they get is “make the content quality better!”. The client manages multiple websites each with 20,000 URLs and has a huge team producing and improving content every day. True - content quality has not always been in their DNA but their current approach **works**. It took me a while to understand the client and in truth this only set in once I really deeply internalized the link between content quality and content quantity. There is no “just” improving content quality without impacting their content quantity - and this is deeply tied to their internal culture, so you can't change that without impacting their company culture... See how deep these rabbit holes can go?Dealing with this requires understanding clients as ecosystems in balance - and swallowing our initial reaction to point out easy solutions.Remember what is easy in one context is next to impossible in another - the theoretically possible can easily be practically impossible when you factor in resources, culture, team dynamics or market dynamics.So before we leap to the “just…” solution we need to listen carefully and deeply understand the client’s strengths and weaknesses.And this requires a positive outlook! Because anything that’s “broken” is in fact a symptom of a strength. And only once you can see the threads that tie these together can you start to understand how to fix the problems while maintaining the strengths.Enduring ClientsI saw an internal McKinsey manual on “The Art of being an Engagement Manager” that has this quote:  Become a friend. This is the true apex of building an enduring client relationship. We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too. Building enduring relationships is not only based on delivering from a business aspect but also delivering from a personal aspect. Ask about the client’s family or interests outside of work. Tell them about your life, your hobbies, or your worries. Be accessible to your client to talk about everything from their career goals to difficulties with their team members. Some clients draw the line at different places, so don’t push…let it happen naturally. Once you feel the client trusts you as he does a friend, you have built a relationship that will likely be a lasting one. After the friendship is formed, like any relationship, it is crucial to follow up regularly and maintain through phone calls, e-mails, and visits.I’m going to re-focus on the key quote here:  We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too.You need to create your own philosophy and tolerance for this blurring of the boundaries between “professional” and “personal” relationships but:I’d argue that the personal/professional boundary is inherently compromised as a consultant.We can masquerade behind an LLC and company brand but consider just a few of the ways that you can blur the lines:  Hanging out with friends (coffee, dinner etc) can lead to talking about business and sharing work, leads and contacts  When you have friends in adjacent or close industries, friends can be your biggest sources of revenue  Clients at one company can leave and then hire you at their next job  During a client engagement you hire your friends to support a projectFor me - this blurring of the boundaries has helped me most often in two specific ways  Someone at a client’s office (sometimes the point of contact, sometimes just someone you worked with) leaves the company and hires you at their new job  A consulting engagement that shifts from being organization focused to individual focused, and shifts from consulting to coaching.Because this is what happens when you help clients succeed as people, not just as organizations.So next time you’re starting a client project think about how to default to optimism as an operating system.In this chapter we’ve focused a lot still on the “performance” of the work - on the language, people interactions and emotions of getting work done. Is that all there is? How can we use this default positivity to open clients up to more creative generative strategy?That’s the next chapter - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients            Remember from Chapter 1 that the consultant often gets brought in mid-performance.

And… Catch up on chapter 1 here.The consultant thrives on problems. Things to be “fixed”, “solved” and “improved”. As a result it can be natural to take pleasure in identifying problems. That smell of a fresh client - waiting to be carved up by sharp 2x2s. A client with problems is a good client for a consultant.And yet…If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.Instead it’s crucial to ignore that gleeful feeling that comes from recognizing problems and force yourself to identify the systems that are working - to embrace the strengths of an organization first.Remember - consulting is humans all the way down - no client wants to bring in a negative, critical or attacking consultant. And no team wants to listen to a consultant that “has a better way of doing things”.The sweet-spot (especially in the first few months of an engagement) is identifying the existing flows, biases and strengths of a client so that you can move with them, not against them. Go with the grain1.Why is this so important? Because if you want to work with an organization for a long time and make a difference, people need to like having you around. Sure, you need to be effective but I’d contend equally, if not more important, is to be a pleasure to work with.The Critical PathHere are some of the problems you might face if you take an overly critical or negative eye:Diagnosing problems without solutions - causing the organization to slow down.Short term engagements that feel productive but don’t last.Culture clash problems with team members at the client’s organization.Creating strategy that sounds good but fails to get implemented.Exhausting clients and client teams with a feeling of urgency and crisis.It can be tempting in particular to treat the work you’re doing with a client as critical. It’s helpful to think this way because it inflates the ego and helps you charge well.But the truth is that if you’re designing for retained work (and you should be) then you will exhaust the teams you’re working with and challenge the status of the executive team. No client wants to be in long-term crisis.Instead - while it may seem counterintuitive the right answer is to downplay the importance of your work. To place the work within a context of comfort. The strongest language you have as a consultant is:“this is a solvable problem”The most successful projects are those where you can build routine solutions to important problems.This provides a sense to the client of competence, of bringing calm to otherwise high-pressure situations and of reminding them that this may take a while to solve!Back-stage in the Theatre of WorkIt can be tempting as a consultant to keep a serious mask on at all times. You might be getting paid an hourly rate that certainly makes you feel all serious and grown up…And yet - it’s humans all the way down and if you want to be effective in the theatre of work you need to recognize and participate in both the front-stage and back-stage environments of a client’s office.Front-stage is loosely defined as “more professional contexts” i.e. meetings, conversations about work directly etc. The Back-stage is loosely defined as “less professional contexts” i.e. the kitchen, breakroom, etc.It can be tempting as a consultant to avoid the back-stage area. Crude humor and letting off steam is a dangerous place for an outsider - and yet if you don’t engage you risk becoming “the outsider” yourself:  Embedded in, arising from and flowing through many of the routines and rituals of professional life, the stream of humour is one of its most distinctive features, providing not only a source of enrichment and nourishment but also serving as a defining characteristic of the territory as represented by its inhabitants.And, just because the back-stage is less formal than the front-stage it’s no less important for real work:  the characteristics of the back region make possible a creative redefinition of professional experience that is achieved through humour and stories. Talking about professional encounters is the stuff of the back region, but it would be a mistake to assume that such talk is trivial simply because of the context in which it occurs: serious business does not necessarily have to be done seriously.Both of these quotes come from the book Language and Professional Identity which is a gem and worth consuming entirely if the study of language interests you2. Combined with my own experience I’ll highlight some ways to think about the back-stage:  Show up in the back-stage of the theatre some-times but not all times. It’s important to give teams the opportunity to retain their identity and you shouldn’t overwhelm them.  Join the humor and crack jokes but keep them middle road - don’t stretch to the edgy humor even if others are, politely decline to be outlandish.  Be incredibly careful with aiming your jokes at any part of the organization - you never know which team or function may become an important part of your work next.  Listen carefully to where humor spills over into showing people’s real frustration and bias with teams, work, executives and organizations. Humor is a strong signal.Positivity &amp; Long Term RetainersHere’s a fun anecdote - I once worked with a client for a long time, in their office every week. After a while I was growing disappointed that I had not had much impact - that I’d not “gotten much done”. When in fact it came to light that the primary reason I was there was to be excited, positive and enthusiastic. The client was trying to do a “new thing” and they recognized that this was hard.Instead they valued the energy, enthusiasm and visibility I was giving to the problem. At times I felt like a puppy consultant - running around the office being excited about things.This engagement helped me realize that there is a value to positivity - that bringing energy and enthusiasm to an organization is worth something, entirely independent of the results and outcomes you’re working on!Although clients will rarely pay for it directly there is value in changing the energy and changing the conversation in an organization. These are precursors to real change. And if you provide this level of positivity and optimism then clients will keep you around irrespective of your “impact”.It’s hard to quantify but I believe this default optimism has helped me stick around for long-term retainers with clients time and time again.So, how do you retain this positive attitude in the face of clients not embracing your changes, resisting new things and generally moving slower than you’d like?On client frustration and the word “just…”It’s important to understand that there is no “just…” in the consultant’s vocabulary.Every business is a balanced system - their strengths and successes are not despite their flaws but because of their flaws.I love this quote: “a problem is a point between two complex systems”3.So, to reframe our initial statement about problems - the key when engaging clients is not to hunt for problems but to hunt for systems.It took me a long time to learn this - that strengths and weaknesses are not in opposition to each other but rather they are in symbiosis.Ah - so tread carefully young consultant. The levers you want to pull are all connected.This is why the initial glee at a client full of “problems” quickly turns to frustration - because it turns out that those initial “problems” were just the other side of the coin for the client’s strengths.Example: I have a client I’ve been working with for three years. We have a running joke that every time they engage a new SEO consultant the advice they get is “make the content quality better!”. The client manages multiple websites each with 20,000 URLs and has a huge team producing and improving content every day. True - content quality has not always been in their DNA but their current approach **works**. It took me a while to understand the client and in truth this only set in once I really deeply internalized the link between content quality and content quantity. There is no “just” improving content quality without impacting their content quantity - and this is deeply tied to their internal culture, so you can't change that without impacting their company culture... See how deep these rabbit holes can go?Dealing with this requires understanding clients as ecosystems in balance - and swallowing our initial reaction to point out easy solutions.Remember what is easy in one context is next to impossible in another - the theoretically possible can easily be practically impossible when you factor in resources, culture, team dynamics or market dynamics.So before we leap to the “just…” solution we need to listen carefully and deeply understand the client’s strengths and weaknesses.And this requires a positive outlook! Because anything that’s “broken” is in fact a symptom of a strength. And only once you can see the threads that tie these together can you start to understand how to fix the problems while maintaining the strengths.Enduring ClientsI saw an internal McKinsey manual on “The Art of being an Engagement Manager” that has this quote:  Become a friend. This is the true apex of building an enduring client relationship. We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too. Building enduring relationships is not only based on delivering from a business aspect but also delivering from a personal aspect. Ask about the client’s family or interests outside of work. Tell them about your life, your hobbies, or your worries. Be accessible to your client to talk about everything from their career goals to difficulties with their team members. Some clients draw the line at different places, so don’t push…let it happen naturally. Once you feel the client trusts you as he does a friend, you have built a relationship that will likely be a lasting one. After the friendship is formed, like any relationship, it is crucial to follow up regularly and maintain through phone calls, e-mails, and visits.I’m going to re-focus on the key quote here:  We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too.You need to create your own philosophy and tolerance for this blurring of the boundaries between “professional” and “personal” relationships but:I’d argue that the personal/professional boundary is inherently compromised as a consultant.We can masquerade behind an LLC and company brand but consider just a few of the ways that you can blur the lines:  Hanging out with friends (coffee, dinner etc) can lead to talking about business and sharing work, leads and contacts  When you have friends in adjacent or close industries, friends can be your biggest sources of revenue  Clients at one company can leave and then hire you at their next job  During a client engagement you hire your friends to support a projectFor me - this blurring of the boundaries has helped me most often in two specific ways  Someone at a client’s office (sometimes the point of contact, sometimes just someone you worked with) leaves the company and hires you at their new job  A consulting engagement that shifts from being organization focused to individual focused, and shifts from consulting to coaching.Because this is what happens when you help clients succeed as people, not just as organizations.So next time you’re starting a client project think about how to default to optimism as an operating system.In this chapter we’ve focused a lot still on the “performance” of the work - on the language, people interactions and emotions of getting work done. Is that all there is? How can we use this default positivity to open clients up to more creative generative strategy?That’s the next chapter - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients            Remember from Chapter 1 that the consultant often gets brought in mid-performance. Not included in 2020 planning but rather a consequence of 2020 planning… &#8617;              This book also contains a truly delightful way of transcribing dialogue preserving things like people talking over each other, pauses, timing etc:  &#8617;              From this article on systems thinking &#8617;      "

  "content": "I recently read the book Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre by Keith Johnstone1. It’s a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly how to teach improvisational theatre.The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant and I have written a five part series. They loosely flow in order but each can be read in any order:Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work. This post looks at the central problem of “performing” work and how important it is for modern knowledge work - especially for the consultant. We end with some ideas around how to think on your feet without bullshitting.Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System. This post highlights the tendency for consultants to be critical and to see everything as a problem. We’ll reframe this by showing the power of being positive - especially for long-term retainers.Chapter 3 - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients. Here we think of clients as blocked actors and we take inspiration from the “Yes! and…” exercise to see how we can unblock clients to generate new strategies and creative thinking with clients.Chapter 4 - Navigating Power &amp; Status. How to get things done inside organizations by understanding power potholes and status switching. We explore the concept of high status and low status and show how the consultant has to become adept at a new skill of “status switching” in order to be successful inside client organizations.Chapter 5 - The Contrary Consultant. Embracing the fool &amp; the power of not fitting in. We explore the identity of outsider and how to reconcile this with working inside client organizations.Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for WorkWhich of these do you recognize?Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we’re working.Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.Jealousy of colleagues who don’t do good work but excel at presenting their work.People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don’t.Much of modern knowledge work is performance… In fact:The office is a theatre,  and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage.Many people aspire to “silent success” at work - to do work that “speaks for itself”. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - for knowledge work, the performance of the work is the work.Because in truth - how else could it function?Much as we might like to think of organizations as rational machines - the reality is that companies are social organizations and people interacting with people is the way decisions are made and how work gets done.And in this theatre of human work it’s crucial to speak up. Spending time on the performance is not wasted - in fact quite the opposite.Without performance work gets sidelined, ignored or worse:  Among more than 120 evaluation and program executives surveyed at private foundations the US and Canada, more than three-quarters had difficulty commissioning evaluations that result in meaningful insights for the field, their grantees, or the foundation itself, and 70% have found it challenging to incorporate evaluation results into the foundation’s future work. A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.” - why your hard work sits on the shelf and what to do about itAnd in fact this excellent Twitter thread from Maxim shows the value in caring deeply about the presentation and context of the work:Nobody ever picks the third, wacky, design direction.&mdash; Maxim Leyzerovich (@round) August 1, 2017What does the “performance” of work look like?Things like:  Presentations of your work  Hallway chats  1:1 conversations to build alignment  Crafting the wrapper and positioning of your work  Changing the language of your work to match others  Including wider contexts of the organization, the industry and the market in your work  Reformatting your presentations to fit other team’s strategies  and much more…In the theatre of work the performance of work is intimately tied to the work itself.But many employees attempt to hide or ignore the performance of work and the politics of the organization. They imagine that this public sphere of voice and politics is wasted energy or somehow “unfair”2.Being present, public and acting with voiceIf we think of the office as a theatre for work the only meaningful way forward is through this sphere of politics and voice. As Venkatesh Rao from Ribbonfarm outlines in his post how to make history:  You do not appear in public through labor, let alone make history. Laboring humans are fungible as individuals, and only consequential actors with a political voice en masse (whether organized in egalitarian ways as a working class or non-egalitarian ways as a patriarchy, or ethno-nationalist clientelistic identity group). […]  If labor is about blending into the processes of nature, and making about interrupting and slowing it to create a durable world, action is about free behaviors that make history.This ideas of “being public” and “exercising voice” both have relatively specific meanings in the Hannah Arendt sense and I’d encourage you to spend time reading here if you’re not familiar3.Here are two examples that might help explain opportunities for being public and having voice:  Example #1: choosing to take a position on something that situates you in the company’s world. A great example of this is Steve Yegge’s platform rant. Note how closely Steve is situated in the narrative here - it’s not simply an observation of the market but of taking a position on the world that situates Google, Amazon and Steve. This can feel daunting but ask yourself the last time you showed up in Slack to post something that has voice? To say something about the organization…  Example #2: asking questions in public forums (all-hands, quarterly business updates etc). These are opportunities where executives are inviting public voice - they’re asking for people to take positions and have opinions.Of course there are an infinite number of other situations where voice and being public are possible4… but most employees would rather shy away from these instead of embracing them as part of the work.Orchestrating performances for your work is the key to more influence and more impact.Enter Stage Left: The ConsultantAh, but so far what we’re describing is the reality of the working world. Now let’s situate the consultant in the theatre of work.The luxury that full time employees gain is the ability to script and rehearse their performances - to plan ahead. The consultant is like an improv actor thrust into a play mid-performance, forced to find ways to fit in, go with the flow and steer the performance all while on stage.For example - full time employees get the luxury of being involved in 2020 planning. Consultants are an outcome of 2020 planning and so get brought in mid-performance to course correct.Consultants that attempt to halt the performance cause pain and typically don’t stick around. Instead consultants that accept and embrace their nature as improv actors thrive and become integrated into the great performance of the organization.The Theatre of Work is an Improv TheatreAs a consultant, attempting to tightly script and design the performance of the work will inevitably lead to missed timings, missed context or missed feedback.Missed timings - As a consultant you’re often working less than 5-days a week with a client. So you’re slower than full-time employees. This means if you try and slow down to polish the performance of your work you can miss the window of opportunity. So the improv consultant must learn to un-polish, prototype and improvise in real-time just to keep up with the client’s organization.Missed context - Because you’re not a full-time employee (even if you’re working 5 days a week) you may not be included on all-hands emails, announcements and so on and so you always have to work hard to gain the full context of a client. Tightly scripting a performance doesn’t leave room for new contexts to emerge during the performance. Instead there should always be room for new context to emerge and get integrated into the performance in real-time.Missed feedback - It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.Good consultants think of performances more like an unfolding series of improv sessions.Many organizations at the executive level already function like tight improv groups - reacting to implicit and explicit cues and playing off each other to make in-the-moment decisions.As a consultant - this executive level improv troupe is where the real work gets done and where you’re aiming for. It’s the essence of why Venkatesh’s idea of client “sparring”5 is so appealing - because it embraces this verbal improv decision making that everyone recognizes.So how does this idea of improv begin to shape our thinking? Some obvious ideas:  We need to be present in the room. Where the performance of the work is the work we can’t leave the presentation and narrative of the work to others.  Study the people as much as you study the organization. When you’re reacting to work mid-performance half of what you’re reacting to is the strategy and half of it is the set of relationships and biases of the people in the room.And one non-obvious idea:The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants &amp; Manufacturing Improv SessionsA failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.Of course I say “spontaneous” because actually humans are remarkably predictable and it’s often trivial to engineer these serendipitous hallway conversations. And you should be manufacturing them.Remember - if you’re a consultant in a client’s office two days a week you’re operating at a serendipity-deficit. You simply have less surface area to bump into people. So you have to cheat.A fellow consultant friend brought up the idea of getting into the office early to deliberately catch the CEO on the way in the door before they settled into focus mode. To intercept them intentionally to create a small improv session. To lay the first seeds for ideas.How to think on your feet without bullshittingAbove all else however, you need to embrace a level of “thinking on your feet” - it’s essential to the consultant’s work and a consequence of being brought in mid-performance.This “thinking on your feet” is about the balance between deflecting decisions for further analysis and providing the answer there and then.  Example: one of the most visible ways this manifests is the first day or week with a new client. Executives love to probe you with “difficult” questions - learning to provide an answer that you believe in but leaves room for revision later is key. The real game that’s being played here is not one of being right or wrong - it’s the executive asking two questions at once - firstly “how much do you know?” and secondly “can you improv?” to understand how useful you’re going to be in the theatre of work.Unfortunately -  in the theatre of work there’s a fine line between thinking on your feet and bullshitting…Who’s been in a meeting and been disgusted with people spouting things that are half-true, made-up or masks over the real truth?There’s a fine line between reacting to a situation in the room and bullshitting.As a consultant this is especially hard to avoid. Your default mode of operating is the liminal space between industries, businesses and markets. A few times a year I’m forced to learn something new from scratch. This forces us to work in spaces where we’re often the least knowledgeable about a specific business (even if we are experts in the industry… And sometimes we’re experts at a discipline but neither knowledgeable about the business or the industry).So here’s a little guide to avoiding bullshit:  Immerse yourself in the core business mechanics, you should be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue &amp; profit function reasonably well. The more abstraction here the more you risk a fundamental mis-understanding and straying into BS.  Become a language chameleon - study and adopt the language,  acronyms and buzzwords of the client’s business. If they call it “earned marketing” you should too. If their CMS is called PinkCloud you call it that too. Specificity allows you to avoid confusion and helps you distinguish between the client’s CMS and the market’s CMS (for example).  Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification on points that don’t seem to make sense. No pretending. Don’t adopt the language too quickly! (ha, see how hard this is?)  Ask stupid questions. Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas. Just because people at the client choose not to talk about obvious things doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.  Defend your ideas but not your points. Be willing to defend your ideas even if some data points get challenged. It’s very common that the number or stat you’re using to support your point will be wrong but that the broader idea still holds. Don’t concede the idea but also don’t try and put muscle behind the numbers - accept they’re wrong but keep pressing on the idea to see where you get.  When you get challenged pull out some counter-factuals - when someone is claiming that your data is wrong challenge them with proving the opposite.  Keep your eye on the prize for business outcomes, not intellectual debates. Executives are fond of theorizing and debating ideas that stray into the get into the abstract - you can play this game a little but try to be the one to ground conversations in reality.  Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Don’t be afraid to source things from different industries. This is the kind of cross-industry vantage point that clients find hard to get internally.These are all ways to avoid bullshitting - but unfortunately there’s one simple way to avoid bullshit - by being critical.It’s far easier to retreat to the critical, negative position and say why things won’t or can’t work. Except… this is a mistake.Being positive and optimistic is far harder but more effective. And we’re going to talk about that in the next post…. Optimism as an Operating System.            I loved the book and as Venkatesh said ‘it is a textbook that teaches you how to see the world differently.’ so consider it recommended.  &#8617;              Yes actually internal company politics and performance are unfair but changing that is not the scope of this post… &#8617;              Handily Venkatesh has a more formal summary of Hannah Arendt’s work here - the first 22 slides are most of what you need for this post. &#8617;              I’ve not delved into it but I think there are insights to be had from studying speech act theory here. &#8617;              More on sparring here &#8617;      "

So you’re slower than full-time employees. This means if you try and slow down to polish the performance of your work you can miss the window of opportunity. So the improv consultant must learn to un-polish, prototype and improvise in real-time just to keep up with the client’s organization.Missed context - Because you’re not a full-time employee (even if you’re working 5 days a week) you may not be included on all-hands emails, announcements and so on and so you always have to work hard to gain the full context of a client. Tightly scripting a performance doesn’t leave room for new contexts to emerge during the performance. Instead there should always be room for new context to emerge and get integrated into the performance in real-time.Missed feedback - It’s not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look “finished”. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it’s important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.Good consultants think of performances more like an unfolding series of improv sessions.Many organizations at the executive level already function like tight improv groups - reacting to implicit and explicit cues and playing off each other to make in-the-moment decisions.As a consultant - this executive level improv troupe is where the real work gets done and where you’re aiming for. It’s the essence of why Venkatesh’s idea of client “sparring”5 is so appealing - because it embraces this verbal improv decision making that everyone recognizes.So how does this idea of improv begin to shape our thinking? Some obvious ideas:  We need to be present in the room. Where the performance of the work is the work we can’t leave the presentation and narrative of the work to others.  Study the people as much as you study the organization. When you’re reacting to work mid-performance half of what you’re reacting to is the strategy and half of it is the set of relationships and biases of the people in the room.And one non-obvious idea:The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants &amp; Manufacturing Improv SessionsA failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work “official” means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.But it’s exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.And the most important thing to understand about these “spontaneous” improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don’t instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.Of course I say “spontaneous” because actually humans are remarkably predictable and it’s often trivial to engineer these serendipitous hallway conversations. And you should be manufacturing them.Remember - if you’re a consultant in a client’s office two days a week you’re operating at a serendipity-deficit. You simply have less surface area to bump into people. So you have to cheat.A fellow consultant friend brought up the idea of getting into the office early to deliberately catch the CEO on the way in the door before they settled into focus mode. To intercept them intentionally to create a small improv session. To lay the first seeds for ideas.How to think on your feet without bullshittingAbove all else however, you need to embrace a level of “thinking on your feet” - it’s essential to the consultant’s work and a consequence of being brought in mid-performance.This “thinking on your feet” is about the balance between deflecting decisions for further analysis and providing the answer there and then.  Example: one of the most visible ways this manifests is the first day or week with a new client. Executives love to probe you with “difficult” questions - learning to provide an answer that you believe in but leaves room for revision later is key. The real game that’s being played here is not one of being right or wrong - it’s the executive asking two questions at once - firstly “how much do you know?” and secondly “can you improv?” to understand how useful you’re going to be in the theatre of work.Unfortunately -  in the theatre of work there’s a fine line between thinking on your feet and bullshitting…Who’s been in a meeting and been disgusted with people spouting things that are half-true, made-up or masks over the real truth?There’s a fine line between reacting to a situation in the room and bullshitting.As a consultant this is especially hard to avoid. Your default mode of operating is the liminal space between industries, businesses and markets. A few times a year I’m forced to learn something new from scratch. This forces us to work in spaces where we’re often the least knowledgeable about a specific business (even if we are experts in the industry… And sometimes we’re experts at a discipline but neither knowledgeable about the business or the industry).So here’s a little guide to avoiding bullshit:  Immerse yourself in the core business mechanics, you should be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue &amp; profit function reasonably well. The more abstraction here the more you risk a fundamental mis-understanding and straying into BS.  Become a language chameleon - study and adopt the language,  acronyms and buzzwords of the client’s business. If they call it “earned marketing” you should too. If their CMS is called PinkCloud you call it that too. Specificity allows you to avoid confusion and helps you distinguish between the client’s CMS and the market’s CMS (for example).  Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification on points that don’t seem to make sense. No pretending. Don’t adopt the language too quickly! (ha, see how hard this is?)  Ask stupid questions. Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas. Just because people at the client choose not to talk about obvious things doesn’t mean you shouldn’t.  Defend your ideas but not your points. Be willing to defend your ideas even if some data points get challenged. It’s very common that the number or stat you’re using to support your point will be wrong but that the broader idea still holds. Don’t concede the idea but also don’t try and put muscle behind the numbers - accept they’re wrong but keep pressing on the idea to see where you get.  When you get challenged pull out some counter-factuals - when someone is claiming that your data is wrong challenge them with proving the opposite.  Keep your eye on the prize for business outcomes, not intellectual debates. Executives are fond of theorizing and debating ideas that stray into the get into the abstract - you can play this game a little but try to be the one to ground conversations in reality.  Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Don’t be afraid to source things from different industries. This is the kind of cross-industry vantage point that clients find hard to get internally.These are all ways to avoid bullshitting - but unfortunately there’s one simple way to avoid bullshit - by being critical.It’s far easier to retreat to the critical, negative position and say why things won’t or can’t work. Except… this is a mistake.Being positive and optimistic is far harder but more effective. And we’re going to talk about that in the next post…. Optimism as an Operating System.            I loved the book and as Venkatesh said ‘it is a textbook that teaches you how to see the world differently.’ so consider it recommended.  &#8617;              Yes actually internal company politics and performance are unfair but changing that is not the scope of this post… &#8617;              Handily Venkatesh has a more formal summary of Hannah Arendt’s work here - the first 22 slides are most of what you need for this post. &#8617;              I’ve not delved into it but I think there are insights to be had from studying speech act theory here. &#8617;              More on sparring here &#8617;      "

  "content": "I’ve been independent 5 years today.Exactly one year ago I posted 4 years on the road. After an incredibly busy summer, my retained revenue had just dried up and I ended on a cliffhanger:  And finally, note how slow I am right now. For the first time since June 2016 I’m at a lull. It feels nice to be cruising out of the city with the windows down and the music playing finally free again! We’ll see how long before the deamons appear nibbling at my heels demanding revenue.Later that afternoon I get a short note “We can do this if you still have Nov/Dec/(Jan?) free.” - an old proposal came back to life out of the blue.Digging back through my email I see that I initially reconnected with this contact after posting my TWO years on the road piece:Then, after some back and forth a dormant proposal came back to life and closed the afternoon of October 24th 2018:5 days later I started in their office three days a week and I’ve been there for the past year.Funny how things go.HighlightsHere’s some highlights and happenings from the past year:  Helped my partner Erin launch a Kickstarter for her kid’s book.  Begun a regular and consistent Wing Tsun practice at bkwingtsun.com - feels great to get back into the groove  Didn’t travel even once for work - an incredible luxury for an independent consultant and highlights the privilege of working in NYC  Watched Roxy grow up (3.5 now!) and learn to tell jokes, brush her own teeth and so so much more. Baby #2 (a boy) on the way in December!  Continued tending to my networks via dinners, coffee meetings and more.  Attended a one day Masterclass from Jan Chipchase on sensemaking for impact which I really enjoyed  Spoke at the iAnnotate conference in DC on annotation for bloggersChartsHere’s the full 5 year view of work (each client being a different color):And here’s just the last 12 months:You can clearly see how much this one client has dominated my work over the past 12 months - something I’ll likely talk about soon as the feeling of being a “perma-lancer” is strong here and it has a bunch of pros and cons combined.Mostly however I’m incredibly grateful to be able to have steady work all year.Here’s some themes, ideas and notes:Gratitude for my Blog &amp; for Those That BlogI’ve written 27 posts so far in 2019 and blogging continues to be one of the most long-term rewarding things I’ve done. The networks, connections and fun I’ve had has been immense. And(!) look back at that email from 2016 that led to a large client engagement for all of 2019. I wrote the post ways of seeing all about the weird ways that work finds you as an independent but *blogging continues to have a long-term compound interest effect.Shout out to the modern 2019 blog-scenius folks. You know who you are.Few of my fave blog posts from the last year:  Exploring the UX of annotations - this one led to me speaking at the Hypothesis conference in DC earlier this year  Building a digital garden - this one really struck a nerve and I love watching people build personal wikis and gardens off the back of this post.  Blogpunk - this is a small little idea but one that’s important. More to think about here. Shout out to Howard for the conversation that prompted this.  New Blogging - Blogchains - I set up the code for blogchains on the site and while it hasn’t quite stuck I’m keen to keep pushing on this format to see where it goes  Networked communities blogchain - this one started with Brendan Schlagel. I’m slightly stalled here because I’m due to write the next post and it’s currently 4000 words…. Lots of potential here though in blogchains and in the networked communities idea. Watch this space.What Book Writing Means to MeIt’s crazy to think that only one year ago the book project was still a “maybe kinda” thing:  I’m starting to think about writing a book. It’ll be something like a manual for other independent consultants - based off my writing around the consultant’s grain and a fieldguide for independent consultants and attempting to thread the needle between theory and practice.Now - the book (working title: The Strategic Independent) is a firm capital-P Project. It’s happening.See the outline here.I’ve now got about 25k words written on the site deliberately under the strategic independent theme and another ~20k words in draft waiting to be finished.Deciding to write a book was a big insight and drive that came from working with my coach last year (thanks Sunil!) and I’m incredibly grateful for the push. Being able to point to the book as a legitimate project and ambition is rewarding - most importantly because I’ve wanted to write a book (any kind of book!) for a long time so I get to scratch a “personal identity” itch.But there’s another reason writing a book about independent consulting is valuable - because it allows me to treat this 5-year “on the road” journey as a single narrative journey connected together by my introspection, study and analysis of the practice of independent consulting. This helps me treat this venture as something that is building and growing (and that I’m personally growing!) rather than as a series of disconnected client gigs.Still though - getting from words written to an actual book is hard! I’m confident that the book will get made in 2020 but it’s still gonna take a bunch of work…Product Design SprintsOne new kind of work that I’ve found this year is partnering with designers to build product design concepts in a tight “sprint” fashion. I’ve done two of these and really enjoyed the process - being able to collaboratively switch back and forth between strategy and design has produced some really interesting projects for clients.Of course, the down side is that both concepts that we worked on are somewhat in limbo with the clients. Speculative design has a habit of getting “stuck” or re-prioritised. In both cases the projects have had impact but just not in the ways we anticipated exactly.I’d really like to do more of this work and I’d like to find ways to help un-stuck it better (or realize the adjacent value better). More to learn and experiment with here in 2020.Little FuturesI’ve partnered with my friend Brian Dell to launch Little Futures which is a research studio to make futures thinking less abstract and more grounded - to shine a light on “arm’s-length futures”. Neither of us are really sure what this means but the core product is a weekly email newsletter where we write what can best be described as business zen koans. They’re fun and people seem to like them. Catch up here:  LF01 - Business Time  LF02 - Every Company Needs to Learn  LF03 - Language is a Problem  LF04 - Play not Prototypes  LF05 - Strategy is Memory  LF06 - Practical NonsenseWe’re having a ton of fun with these and I’m really excited to figure out how to make Little Futures a bigger part of 2020…Money MusingsOverall 2019 was great and very stable revenue-wise but being independent forces you to think about money in new ways. I took a holiday during a client consulting project and as a result it was a 5-figure holiday due to time off client work. With baby #2 on the way in December I’ll take time of client work in Jan/Feb and that’ll likely end up being a 5-figure paternity leave.These things are broadly “priced in” to what I charge but that’s a different story to actually experiencing the decisions - (“should I take a holiday to see family? is it worth 5 figures?”)I’m posting this not to complain - these are all deliberate choices I’m making but rather thinking about and rationalizing money is a funny thing when you’re independent and I hope there’s value in talking about it and sharing stories. I think there’ll be a chapter in the book about this…Thank YouIn summary - 2019 was a year of grace, movement and joy both at work and at home and I’m incredibly grateful for everyone who helped and supported along the way. Too many names to list but a huge THANK YOU to everyone.Onwards on the road.As Jack Kerouac said:“There was nowhere to go but everywhere, so just keep on rolling under the stars.”"

  "content": "I’ve been independent 5 years today.Exactly one year ago I posted 4 years on the road. After an incredibly busy summer, my retained revenue had just dried up and I ended on a cliffhanger:  And finally, note how slow I am right now. For the first time since June 2016 I’m at a lull. It feels nice to be cruising out of the city with the windows down and the music playing finally free again! We’ll see how long before the deamons appear nibbling at my heels demanding revenue.Later that afternoon I get a short note “We can do this if you still have Nov/Dec/(Jan?) free.” - an old proposal came back to life out of the blue.Digging back through my email I see that I initially reconnected with this contact after posting my TWO years on the road piece:Then, after some back and forth a dormant proposal came back to life and closed the afternoon of October 24th 2018:5 days later I started in their office three days a week and I’ve been there for the past year.Funny how things go.HighlightsHere’s some highlights and happenings from the past year:  Helped my partner Erin launch a Kickstarter for her kid’s book.  Begun a regular and consistent Wing Tsun practice at bkwingtsun.com - feels great to get back into the groove  Didn’t travel even once for work - an incredible luxury for an independent consultant and highlights the privilege of working in NYC  Watched Roxy grow up (3.5 now!) and learn to tell jokes, brush her own teeth and so so much more. Baby #2 (a boy) on the way in December!  Continued tending to my networks via dinners, coffee meetings and more.  Attended a one day Masterclass from Jan Chipchase on sensemaking for impact which I really enjoyed  Spoke at the iAnnotate conference in DC on annotation for bloggersChartsHere’s the full 5 year view of work (each client being a different color):And here’s just the last 12 months:You can clearly see how much this one client has dominated my work over the past 12 months - something I’ll likely talk about soon as the feeling of being a “perma-lancer” is strong here and it has a bunch of pros and cons combined.Mostly however I’m incredibly grateful to be able to have steady work all year.Here’s some themes, ideas and notes:Gratitude for my Blog &amp; for Those That BlogI’ve written 27 posts so far in 2019 and blogging continues to be one of the most long-term rewarding things I’ve done. The networks, connections and fun I’ve had has been immense. And(!) look back at that email from 2016 that led to a large client engagement for all of 2019. I wrote the post ways of seeing all about the weird ways that work finds you as an independent but *blogging continues to have a long-term compound interest effect.Shout out to the modern 2019 blog-scenius folks. You know who you are.Few of my fave blog posts from the last year:  Exploring the UX of annotations - this one led to me speaking at the Hypothesis conference in DC earlier this year  Building a digital garden - this one really struck a nerve and I love watching people build personal wikis and gardens off the back of this post.  Blogpunk - this is a small little idea but one that’s important. More to think about here. Shout out to Howard for the conversation that prompted this.  New Blogging - Blogchains - I set up the code for blogchains on the site and while it hasn’t quite stuck I’m keen to keep pushing on this format to see where it goes  Networked communities blogchain - this one started with Brendan Schlagel. I’m slightly stalled here because I’m due to write the next post and it’s currently 4000 words…. Lots of potential here though in blogchains and in the networked communities idea. Watch this space.What Book Writing Means to MeIt’s crazy to think that only one year ago the book project was still a “maybe kinda” thing:  I’m starting to think about writing a book. It’ll be something like a manual for other independent consultants - based off my writing around the consultant’s grain and a fieldguide for independent consultants and attempting to thread the needle between theory and practice.Now - the book (working title: The Strategic Independent) is a firm capital-P Project. It’s happening.See the outline here.I’ve now got about 25k words written on the site deliberately under the strategic independent theme and another ~20k words in draft waiting to be finished.Deciding to write a book was a big insight and drive that came from working with my coach last year (thanks Sunil!) and I’m incredibly grateful for the push. Being able to point to the book as a legitimate project and ambition is rewarding - most importantly because I’ve wanted to write a book (any kind of book!) for a long time so I get to scratch a “personal identity” itch.But there’s another reason writing a book about independent consulting is valuable - because it allows me to treat this 5-year “on the road” journey as a single narrative journey connected together by my introspection, study and analysis of the practice of independent consulting. This helps me treat this venture as something that is building and growing (and that I’m personally growing!) rather than as a series of disconnected client gigs.Still though - getting from words written to an actual book is hard! I’m confident that the book will get made in 2020 but it’s still gonna take a bunch of work…Product Design SprintsOne new kind of work that I’ve found this year is partnering with designers to build product design concepts in a tight “sprint” fashion. I’ve done two of these and really enjoyed the process - being able to collaboratively switch back and forth between strategy and design has produced some really interesting projects for clients.Of course, the down side is that both concepts that we worked on are somewhat in limbo with the clients. Speculative design has a habit of getting “stuck” or re-prioritised. In both cases the projects have had impact but just not in the ways we anticipated exactly.I’d really like to do more of this work and I’d like to find ways to help un-stuck it better (or realize the adjacent value better). More to learn and experiment with here in 2020.Little FuturesI’ve partnered with my friend Brian Dell to launch Little Futures which is a research studio to make futures thinking less abstract and more grounded - to shine a light on “arm’s-length futures”. Neither of us are really sure what this means but the core product is a weekly email newsletter where we write what can best be described as business zen koans. They’re fun and people seem to like them. Catch up here:  LF01 - Business Time  LF02 - Every Company Needs to Learn  LF03 - Language is a Problem  LF04 - Play not Prototypes  LF05 - Strategy is Memory  LF06 - Practical NonsenseWe’re having a ton of fun with these and I’m really excited to figure out how to make Little Futures a bigger part of 2020…Money MusingsOverall 2019 was great and very stable revenue-wise but being independent forces you to think about money in new ways. I took a holiday during a client consulting project and as a result it was a 5-figure holiday due to time off client work. With baby #2 on the way in December I’ll take time of client work in Jan/Feb and that’ll likely end up being a 5-figure paternity leave.These things are broadly “priced in” to what I charge but that’s a different story to actually experiencing the decisions - (“should I take a holiday to see family? is it worth 5 figures?”)I’m posting this not to complain - these are all deliberate choices I’m making but rather thinking about and rationalizing money is a funny thing when you’re independent and I hope there’s value in talking about it and sharing stories. I think there’ll be a chapter in the book about this…Thank YouIn summary - 2019 was a year of grace, movement and joy both at work and at home and I’m incredibly grateful for everyone who helped and supported along the way. Too many names to list but a huge THANK YOU to everyone.Onwards on the road.As Jack Kerouac said:“There was nowhere to go but everywhere, so just keep on rolling under the stars.”"

Of our six shoppers, two saw no Glossier targeted ads or social posts at all. Of the remaining four, only one saw any display ads. These four saw several sponsored posts on Instagram and Facebook.In particular, this can help highlight the uneasy lived experience of digital ads.

Where the quantitative stops the qualitative begins. I’ve been a champion of ethnography in business for a while and I really enjoyed this clear-eyed post on attempting to discern between insight and noise for a startup using the tools of ethnography:  The critical eye of ethnography can scrutinize the problematic nature of a startup’s we-built-it-in-the-garage mythology. Removed too far from reality, startups often rely too heavily on initial visions. And when vision leads the way, insights and reality, including (and especially) ethnographic insight, tends to challenge (and sometimes support) that vision.  At the same time, the critical eye of ethnography can serve as a valuable tool for investors to evaluate start-up stories, helping determine whether these new ideas meet customer needs while also assessing whether their organizational cultures are a good fit to accomplish the challenge at-hand. Because it’s when the two are in conversation—customer needs and organizational culture aptitude—that new and unexpected opportunities for entrepreneurs become reality. And as such, ethnography should be considered a valuable tool in the startup world, for evaluating new ideas and generating them, too. Rather than looking to ethnography to validate or verify, its greater value is in guiding and inspiring a startup.Reconciling The IntangiblesIt’s been a busy few weeks in “brand” news - there’s a short article about Adidas circulating about how they are re-balancing towards brand marketing:  The sports brand’s global media director, Simon Peel, explains that four years ago the company didn’t have any econometrics, its attribution modelling was based on last-click and it didn’t do any brand tracking. It also focused on efficiency over effectiveness, leading it to look at specific KPIs and how to reduce their cost rather than what was in the best interests of its brands.And my friends at Wistia just announced a focus on “brand affinity marketing”. See this tweet thread:Brand marketing is becoming far more important in a world where ‘the funnel’ is breaking, and most digital marketing tactics are less effective #watchCTC&mdash; Phil Nottingham (@philnottingham) October 2, 2019And this guide to affinity marketingUnpacking this and attempting to reconcile is hard here - both stories portray a slightly simplistic view of how brands operate and function in the modern world. And both rely on the supremacy of bold creative ideas.Ultimately of course true success hangs in the balance and tension between brand and performance marketing and in fact I think the real story here is less about the true “balance” between the two but rather in creating a coherent whole out of your brand and performance/direct marketing.Headless BrandsAll of the above however is predicated on a top down “controlled” version of brand marketing. Perhaps the future will be less centralized - perhaps the future will be decentralized or headless brands:  the rise of networked media has challenged the coherence of centrally-managed brand identities. New blockchain-based decentralized organizations take this a step further by giving users financial incentive to spread brand narratives of their own. We introduce the concept of headless brands to explain the community-driven brand dynamics of projects which have no centralized managerial body. We describe some elements of a headless brand’s lifecycle, from formation to adoption, and suggest strategies to maintain a brand’s coherence.While today this is true for blockchain projects perhaps the world of tomorrow creates market based incentive structures for smaller niche brand audiences - allowing single monolithic brands to splinter into a myriad of brand-worlds where a single brand creates many brand identities across many communities.In ConclusionThere’s no clear way forward. The accelerating world of technology and culture is going to increasingly challenge our existing notions of how brands work and how brand marketing works. There are no answers but it’s clear that the first step is to take another look at the environment that your brand operates in and attempt to understand the market and marketing reality of your audiences.

  "content": "Selling consulting work is tricky - there’s a foundational inside/outside problem for consultants; how do you know enough about the client or their problems to put together a proposal?Essentially you’re looking for ways to “bridge” from outside to inside. If only you could open a portal inside their organization and take a peek…Turns out you can - by selling a workshop.My default response to all new clients over the past few years is to sell a workshop, and it’s helped me sell better work that retains for longer.“Workshops” can mean many different things but in this post I’m going to talk specifically about designing workshops for clarity - to portal inside the client’s business and create a bridge to long-term retained work.The trick is not to design these workshops to “solve” anything but rather to think of them as jam-sessions to create clarity.Imagine attempting to “solve” brand strategy in a one-day workshop? Likely impossible. But you can create clarity.And clarity is valuable - so you can charge well for these workshops if you set them up right.In this post:  Why clarity is important for both consultant and client  How to structure a workshop for outcomes, not happiness  A series of conversation prompts to run effective jam-sessions  Why you shouldn’t undersell yourself (aka selling one day’s work for $4,000)  Some examples from my own workFirst though, some narrative theory…In media res“In media res” literally means “in the middle of things” and it’s a narrative device that movies and books use all the time. Open with the protagonist leaping through the air between buildings, tentacles grasping mid-air behind… and then figure out a way to explain what’s going on later.People will have an appetite for the boring stuff once you tease the action.Consulting works this way too - both client and consultant yearn for in media res - i.e. a sense of how it’s going to feel to work together.The client thinks:  Can the consultant help us with these specific problems?  Does the consultant know anything?  Will our work-styles match or clash?  Will this consultant be reliable?  How do I persuade my boss to work with the consultant?The consultant thinks:  Is there a big enough project here to justify a consulting engagement?  What are their real problems and can I solve them?  What are their team dynamics and personalities and can I work with them?  Will our work-styles match or clash?There’s a foundational inside/outside problem for consultants - how do you know enough about the client to even put together a proposal? Can you trust clients to self-report their problems accurately? How do you get access as an outsider?But, typically, before you can get there you need to battle through a conversation about price and contracts…So how do you get some sense of in media res for both client and consultant before wading through contract negotiation?Selling Portal WorkshopsThe trick to navigating this chicken/egg problem of contracts/context is to respond to a proposal with an initial workshop. A portal workshop.Here’s a real example:The trick is that a “small” piece of work (more on pricing later) is often an easier sell than a full retainer or larger project scope. So you can skip around the contract/context question to portal into the client’s reality and create some clarity.The eagle-eyed among you might notice that the “scope” for this workshop is incredibly loose. These aren’t workshops that have a ton of programming and heavy agenda - they should be more jam session than pre-programmed workshop.Jam Sessions“Workshop” is a difficult word. People mean lots of different things and workshops can come in many flavors1.For me, these initial workshops work best as collaborative working sessions rather than pre-programmed facilitation. Depending on the client’s comfort I’ll prepare anything from a four bullet point agenda to a little prep-deck to walk through, but I find the more I pull together an agenda the worse the workshop is.Invariably, the lived experience feels more like a jam session than a guided workshop. Free jazz not pop. Experience not performance. Collaborative not guided.Why take this approach?Let’s recap the goals - with this portal into the client’s reality we’re trying to:  Get comfortable “sparring”2 with the client  Make the client feel that you’ll listen closely  Understand the real problems and make sure they will put budget against solving them  Demonstrate to the client that you can help  Understand the client’s team dynamics  Understand the context for the work properly (i.e. what is the work, who are the people, why now)  Identify client’s blind spots (their unknown unknowns)So many unknowns!Without room for improvisation, sparring and discussion you won’t get enough of the context that you’re after.And typically I restrict these sessions to no more than 5-6 people - beyond that it’s hard to hear the individual voices and people start to put on masks and behave differently around each other. If you want the truth, keep the group small.Conversation prompts for running an effective jam sessionJust because it’s a free-jam session doesn’t mean you can’t prepare and think ahead to how you’ll explore the client’s reality.Here’s a few conversation prompts, guides and pointers for running an effective jam session - all designed to gain clarity:  Restate the situation and goals as the first thing. Be sure to tease out any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the client’s answer. Push for specifics and don’t plaster over the cracks.  The core interaction of the day is question/response, question/response. Don’t try to be linear, instead be recursive - never settle on the first answer but keep following threads until you get somewhere. Always looks for the next logical question that bridges from the last.  Don’t look for smart questions, look for dumb questions. “Ok, this might be a stupid question but why don’t we just build this the way we built the last one?”. My favorite dumb question: “Seems like you have a good handle on the problem and the solution - what do you need me for?”  Create plenty of “what ifs” - “Let’s just pretend for a moment we have the VP marketing hired, what projects do we think they’d be responsible for?”  Be frank and to the point. “Do you believe you have the team to execute that plan? Where are the gaps?” or “Why won’t the CEO sign off on the budget?”  Don’t be afraid to “solve” small problems in the room - especially those where you have some domain expertise and the credibility for people to trust your answer.  DO be afraid to solve big problems in the room. Even if you think you have a clear solution… you don’t. At best you come up with a “solution” that could work in theory, but fails to get sold in and implemented or is too generic and actually misses some context.. At worst, your “solution” is no solution at all, is a failed solution they have already rejected, or gets taken forward as an apparent solution that falls apart later.  Aggressively reframe problems “ok, let’s say this another way” really help get to the real issues underlying the stated problems  Keep a running list of discrete problems. “OK, so we’ve agreed that the marketing dashboard isn’t working and needs rebuilding, analytics needs an audit as we’re not confident in it, some basic keyword research would help guide your editorial team and there’s some SEO knowledge gaps in your tech team so we should run some training” - this list of problems is going to help you scope the ongoing retainer after the workshop.  Dead time is the ultimate goal. Pauses to think are the whole point. Questions where there’s no trite easy answer are powerful. Let them settle in and leave the room quiet for a bit.Engineer for outcomes not optimismMy favorite way to think about any workshop is that you’re here to get productive outcomes, not have a nice time.This is especially true for small jam sessions like this - sure we want to know and understand that we can work together but I don’t want to hold your hand and I don’t want to shy away from questioning your thinking.So think ahead of time what the potential outcomes are and what you need to know - and drive towards it.Clients will more readily hire you after an exhausting and challenging workshop where everyone feels like progress was made, over a feel-good workshop where all the boxes were ticked and post-its pinned up, but ultimately no one felt like they were much further along.Workshops for selling open-ended retainersSo these portal workshops help bridge the outside/inside of the consultant/client realities but what happens after the workshop?Here are some unsurprising but important outcomes:  A personal relationship with the client contact  A shared experience of working together (in media res)  A richer understanding and awareness of the client’s context, the project’s context and the real problems the client faces  A sketch and conceptual framework for how to solve the problems (or at least where to start looking for solutions)But here’s one surprising outcome:You can get away with a much lighter SOW (statement of work) after a good workshopI’ve heard from other indie consultants and freelancers that sometimes putting together a scope or SOW and getting it approved by the client is a real point of pain - even once you’re aligned on the project and scope!The negotiation is hard when you’re lacking trust and context and both parties are trying to anticipate what kinds of work and what level of detail is needed.But in my experience once you’ve been in a room together for a day or two negotiating a scope becomes much simpler - there’s some trust set up and context for the work that means you can write a scope such as:  Tom to be on site to help with audience development 2 days a weekThis solves a lot of headaches3!$4,000 days - A note on pricing these workshopsIt’s crucial not to undersell yourself for these workshops. On the one hand you could argue that since this workshop is designed to sell a long term retainer you could discount it or even deliver it for free. Certainly the economics justify it.Except - this is your best chance to anchor the client on your rates. If you undersell yourself in this workshop then the chances are you’re not going to get the rate you want for the ongoing retainer.So - I recommend taking your day rate and doubling it for these workshops. So if your day rate is $2,000 / day, a one-day workshop would be $4,000.Since this is a relatively small amount of money (though a high day rate!) it’s often more straightforward to get sign off. And I often sell these by explaining there’s prep work, research and some kind of debrief follow-up.But here’s a word of caution - if you follow this advice you might end up selling an “expensive” workshop and then feel anxious about the free-jam nature of it - so you decide to over-plan and over-engineer the workshop and end up settling on a more structured workshop that doesn’t deliver.To get around this thinking - let’s take an example. Let’s say you’re an expert in brand positioning. A client is having some trouble thinking about brand marketing (maybe they’re not doing much of it right now? Or they’re thinking of hiring a head of brand?) so they engage you for a day’s workshop.Now, stop and think - do you truly believe that this client’s brand marketing challenges can be solved in a day? Brand marketing is expensive! It’s slow! There’s no way you can solve this in one day.So what are you actually selling here? Clarity. And clarity is valuable!Four interesting anecdotes from my own workIt’s hard to give real case studies for these workshops because so much of the work is left in the room - improv and spontaneous. But here are four interesting memories from recent work:Five figures for two daysThe most expensive workshop I’ve ever done was sold on an initial phone call and a one page Google Doc agenda outline. Here’s a sample to show you how bare bones the agenda was:Following this workshop we settled on a monthly retainer and I ended up working with them for over two years.A workshop that went sidewaysOne of my most fun workshops was a one day workshop where the very first question of the day derailed the whole agenda.Five people were in the room and I asked them to go around the room and explain the project in their own words. By the time we’d gone around the table there was such an obvious mismatch in expectations that we spent the whole day unpacking it - what was supposed to be an audience development workshop became more of an organizational and alignment workshop.In hindsight I think I played the role of group therapy more than consultant for this one. A rigid agenda or trying to follow a script too closely would have missed the value of this freestyle session that largely exposed and clarified problems rather than solved anything.Coming out of this workshop we collaborated on a few one off projects but it was clear to me that an ongoing retainer didn’t make sense unless we resolved these tensions internally at the client.A workshop full of silenceRecently I ran a one day workshop with lots of dead air. Awkward questions that seemed to hang in the air. At the time this workshop felt stilted, strained and perhaps unproductive - why couldn’t we get to the answers we were trying to drive towards?Towards the end of the day and in the follow up it became clear that when the client confidently stated they “knew the industry” and understood the influencers in the space they actually had a very light grasp of the players and their business, their strengths and how they functioned. They were trying to develop a strategy while missing the context they were operating in.This ultimately informed almost the entire output from the workshop - the insight that more in-depth research was needed to understand the landscape more clearly and fundamentally before they could develop a strategy.WeWork(shop)Portals are tricky things. And sometimes you get stuck in-between dimensions4.Here’s an email I got after running a two-day workshop last year:In fact, I will very often deliberately use the word “us” and “we” rather than “you” when talking to clients to help establish a partner-style relationship rather than agency/client relationship.That said - clearly in this case it didn’t land right, but I’d probably do the same again given the chance!ConclusionI’m sure there are many other ways to bridge the gap to the client’s reality but if there’s one thing to remember, it’s that clarity is crucial to good work.So look for ways to build context and clarity by design into your workflow - either in how you get new clients, how you close them or the kinds of work that you do.Whatever kind of client you’re looking for I’d encourage you to think about how you can skip to the action - is there a way to stage a mini work session and feel what it’s like to work together before committing?And don’t be afraid to charge well for this work - clarity is valuable! And it sets the stage for any future work.So construct a portal into your client’s reality and play some jazz.            See this post from Howard on the three flavors of workshops &#8617;              More on what sparring means from Venkatesh on his site and in this twitter thread. &#8617;              Note: If you’re finding that clients aren’t receptive to the idea of workshops then it could well be a symptom of a different problem - that is not getting warm leads for senior work. If clients already have you in a box and/or you’re pitching against other vendors then this workshop approach could fail. &#8617;              Portals can be dangerous things… &#8617;      "

  "content": "Selling consulting work is tricky - there’s a foundational inside/outside problem for consultants; how do you know enough about the client or their problems to put together a proposal?Essentially you’re looking for ways to “bridge” from outside to inside. If only you could open a portal inside their organization and take a peek…Turns out you can - by selling a workshop.My default response to all new clients over the past few years is to sell a workshop, and it’s helped me sell better work that retains for longer.“Workshops” can mean many different things but in this post I’m going to talk specifically about designing workshops for clarity - to portal inside the client’s business and create a bridge to long-term retained work.The trick is not to design these workshops to “solve” anything but rather to think of them as jam-sessions to create clarity.Imagine attempting to “solve” brand strategy in a one-day workshop? Likely impossible. But you can create clarity.And clarity is valuable - so you can charge well for these workshops if you set them up right.In this post:  Why clarity is important for both consultant and client  How to structure a workshop for outcomes, not happiness  A series of conversation prompts to run effective jam-sessions  Why you shouldn’t undersell yourself (aka selling one day’s work for $4,000)  Some examples from my own workFirst though, some narrative theory…In media res“In media res” literally means “in the middle of things” and it’s a narrative device that movies and books use all the time. Open with the protagonist leaping through the air between buildings, tentacles grasping mid-air behind… and then figure out a way to explain what’s going on later.People will have an appetite for the boring stuff once you tease the action.Consulting works this way too - both client and consultant yearn for in media res - i.e. a sense of how it’s going to feel to work together.The client thinks:  Can the consultant help us with these specific problems?  Does the consultant know anything?  Will our work-styles match or clash?  Will this consultant be reliable?  How do I persuade my boss to work with the consultant?The consultant thinks:  Is there a big enough project here to justify a consulting engagement?  What are their real problems and can I solve them?  What are their team dynamics and personalities and can I work with them?  Will our work-styles match or clash?There’s a foundational inside/outside problem for consultants - how do you know enough about the client to even put together a proposal? Can you trust clients to self-report their problems accurately? How do you get access as an outsider?But, typically, before you can get there you need to battle through a conversation about price and contracts…So how do you get some sense of in media res for both client and consultant before wading through contract negotiation?Selling Portal WorkshopsThe trick to navigating this chicken/egg problem of contracts/context is to respond to a proposal with an initial workshop. A portal workshop.Here’s a real example:The trick is that a “small” piece of work (more on pricing later) is often an easier sell than a full retainer or larger project scope. So you can skip around the contract/context question to portal into the client’s reality and create some clarity.The eagle-eyed among you might notice that the “scope” for this workshop is incredibly loose. These aren’t workshops that have a ton of programming and heavy agenda - they should be more jam session than pre-programmed workshop.Jam Sessions“Workshop” is a difficult word. People mean lots of different things and workshops can come in many flavors1.For me, these initial workshops work best as collaborative working sessions rather than pre-programmed facilitation. Depending on the client’s comfort I’ll prepare anything from a four bullet point agenda to a little prep-deck to walk through, but I find the more I pull together an agenda the worse the workshop is.Invariably, the lived experience feels more like a jam session than a guided workshop. Free jazz not pop. Experience not performance. Collaborative not guided.Why take this approach?Let’s recap the goals - with this portal into the client’s reality we’re trying to:  Get comfortable “sparring”2 with the client  Make the client feel that you’ll listen closely  Understand the real problems and make sure they will put budget against solving them  Demonstrate to the client that you can help  Understand the client’s team dynamics  Understand the context for the work properly (i.e. what is the work, who are the people, why now)  Identify client’s blind spots (their unknown unknowns)So many unknowns!Without room for improvisation, sparring and discussion you won’t get enough of the context that you’re after.And typically I restrict these sessions to no more than 5-6 people - beyond that it’s hard to hear the individual voices and people start to put on masks and behave differently around each other. If you want the truth, keep the group small.Conversation prompts for running an effective jam sessionJust because it’s a free-jam session doesn’t mean you can’t prepare and think ahead to how you’ll explore the client’s reality.Here’s a few conversation prompts, guides and pointers for running an effective jam session - all designed to gain clarity:  Restate the situation and goals as the first thing. Be sure to tease out any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the client’s answer. Push for specifics and don’t plaster over the cracks.  The core interaction of the day is question/response, question/response. Don’t try to be linear, instead be recursive - never settle on the first answer but keep following threads until you get somewhere. Always looks for the next logical question that bridges from the last.  Don’t look for smart questions, look for dumb questions. “Ok, this might be a stupid question but why don’t we just build this the way we built the last one?”. My favorite dumb question: “Seems like you have a good handle on the problem and the solution - what do you need me for?”  Create plenty of “what ifs” - “Let’s just pretend for a moment we have the VP marketing hired, what projects do we think they’d be responsible for?”  Be frank and to the point. “Do you believe you have the team to execute that plan?

  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2019/07/12/annotate-the-outline/",
  "date": "July 12, 2019",
  "content": "Hey, let’s try something new today. Two things I want to do:Firstly - I’ve got Hypothes.is annotations installed by default on my blog so everytime you highlight some text you get the ability to leave an annotation. Think of it like in-line comments just like Google Docs. But few people know how to use it or have an account - so the best way to get people comfortable with this is just to actively encourage it          Directly cultivating community is a great thing to kickstart engagement - I did this a long time ago when I first installed disqus and it was fun! See that post here: Intentional Communities               ! Please try it out and let me know how you feel! (Yes I’m aware hypothesis kinda sucks on mobile… sorry!)Secondly - I’m in the middle of writing a book. And I want to use the excuse of cultivating community and getting people familiar with Hypothesis to help me out by annotating the book outline below.I’d love to get your comments, feedback, ideas and suggestions for where the outline and chapters fall short, where you enjoyed what you read so far and where you want to see more. (Of course, if you don’t want to use Hypothesis then there’s the usual Disqus at the bottom of the post).The Book - Working title: The Strategic IndependentThis book all started when I wrote a blog post called The Consultant’s Grain          My working title for a while was going to be just The Consultant’s Grain. Thoughts? I think I prefer The Strategic Independent but open to feedback…               . That post triggered me thinking about writing a book about being an independent consultant. But over time the ideas and work around being independent started to form into a slightly broader thesis - The Strategic Independent - where this book should be helpful for any kind of independent, freelancer or contractor that wants to think holistically about the work they do and how they fit into client organizations.So, the working title The Strategic Independent.What this book isn’t: it’s important to note two concepts that I’m directly trying to shy away from. Firstly - this is not a beginners guide to consulting. There’s a fair amount of content out there about that and I think it’s a market that’s better served already. Plus - while some of the beginner ideas are useful I’m more interested in exploring the ideas I myself am wrestling with i.e. the mid-career consulting concepts and ideas (I’m almost 5 years into my indie consulting journey now).Secondly - I’m trying hard not to write the “If you follow these ideas you too can be rich” book model. There’s a ton of that out there already and I hate it. I want to explore the messy reality of how it feels to be a consultant. Where can you trip yourself up? What is the emotional journey? How do you actually get things done inside organizations? How do you do weird and interesting work that keeps you engaged? These ideas are more important to me than just chasing the money (though hopefully if you do those ideas well the money will follow).So, here’s a summary of the pieces I’ve written so far and the overall book outline. Please annotate all over it with ideas and suggestions!Chapter 1 - Intro and overviewThis will be… some kind of intro I suppose! Most of these ideas are explored in my post The Strategic Independent (4,700 words) including:  The foundational frame of “work in context”  The interplay between strategy work and execution that allows you to retain clients for 12-18+ months at a time  What “strategy and stewardship” is and how I think about it  How to learn to be more strategic in your work and how to deliberately learn from client engagements  Only letting clients “in the strategy door” as a way to find good work and avoid issues later onChapter 2 - From Networking to NetworkedThis chapter will cover the messy reality of finding clients and what it means to be “networked” not “do networking”. There are two posts I’ve written here already:Small b blogging (1,800 words) - although this post wasn’t deliberately part of my strategy writing there’s a re-write of this post that explores networked writing (aka blogging) for indie consultants. The core of the idea is to write for community and connection, not mass appeal. It references the idea from Venkatesh of “release, rework, reference”          For those not sleeping at the back of class you might notice this post itself is a great example of reworking and referencing my own work!        When I re-write this small-b-blogging concept in the context of indie consulting I should explore some concrete examples from other indie consultants to better demonstrate the idea in practice I think.Strange Attraction (3,000 words) - this post explores how I think about “lead generation” for my consulting work and contains a bunch of examples. The core concept being that building networks of interesting peers and then keeping them up to date with your work and how you work can generate warm intros which is the holy grail of consulting.I think there’s one more post in this series (unwritten today) exploring the idea of “trust totems” - i.e. reference objects that give potential clients confidence that you’re an expert and allow them to find purchase on what you do. Things like books, how to guides, conference talks etc all act as trust totems and many mid-career consultants will have these by default. But it’s important to understand that case studies kind of don’t count here! It’s more important to show rather than tell here.Chapter 3 - Bridging the GapThis chapter is all about going from warm lead to long-term retainer and all of the things that go into that. Broadly I think there are two concepts to flesh out here (neither of which I’ve written yet):The idea of workshops as portals into organizations. Something I’ve mentioned informally to a lot of folks and always seems to be useful is that I try and start all my consulting engagements with a workshop. Not a structured learning workshop but a free-jazz exploration of the problem space. These workshops are like magic portals that get you inside the client’s organization very fast and also begin building bridges so that you can close a larger ongoing retainer much more easily for two reasons: you have more context for the problem and you already built trust with the client.Some kind of post exploring sales, how to structure a proposal, how to write an SOW etc. I don’t consider myself an expert here so I’m not 100% sure what take I’m going to have here but I think it’s a common pain point so I want to try and approach this in a way that hasn’t quite been covered before. Perhaps by exploring the emotional and inner anguish that comes with money talk and invoicing?Chapter 4 - Effective Strategy WorkI’m pretty obsessed with doing effective strategy work. Work beyond powerpoints and documents - work that actually transforms and changes organizations. This chapter will explore how to do good work for clients, while recognizing that it’s hard to actually bring about change for clients. This is probably where I’ve done the most writing to date:High fidelity consulting (1,000 words) - “Ideas without details and details without ideas are both risky”. This concept is all about moving beyond documents to a higher fidelity of work to enable you to be more provocative and useful with your outputs. This post is a short sketch of a longer piece that would explore more real examples of how I’ve done this in my own work.How to get things done (500 words) - there’s a few provocative ideas in this post that need exploring and expanding. Most notably the deck linked here that really gets into the heart of the idea that “Amateurs talk about strategy. Professionals talk about logistics”. Again, when I flesh this post out to be a longer piece I need to bring in more real examples from my own work.Yes! and… - “How to think on your feet without bullshitting”. I’ve got an analogy in my head around why improv comedy is much like consulting. Thinking on your feet, making things up without resorting to outright bullshit, keeping the focus of a room and so on. This post is not yet written, so let me know what you want to see in this post!Strategy is the organic flow of ideas and people (900 words) - here we start to expand our idea of what kind of work we’re hired for in the first place and recognize that it’s all about the people. The title of this post is taken from an excellent paper by Stripe Partners and there’s lots more thining to do here. I think I can fold my idea of “shadow org charts” and how to understand power flows inside client’s teams inside this piece to make something compelling.The consultant’s grain (2,500 words) - the piece that started it all! This piece is grounded in the insight that “(their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast”. It’s crucial to recognize which recommendations and strategies will go with the organization’s grain and which will go against the grain. Very different approaches are needed for each situation. This post is getting old now and likely needs a re-write but I’m still mostly happy with it.Ways of seeing (3,800 words) - this was the first piece I wrote as a deliberate longer form beginning of my book writing practice. It’s the sequel to the consultant’s grain piece above. This covers how you actually understand and recognize an organization’s culture and embraces the idea that perhaps the pinnacle of consulting work is to help your clients to see in new ways.How (and why) to roll your own frameworks in consulting engagements (5,000 words) - you could easily imagine this as the third part of a mini-trilogy directly following on from the two posts above. Ff teaching clients ways of seeing is important, this post shows you how to actually do it and walks through some pitfalls I’ve fallen into in my own work trying to rely on off the shelf frameworks. This post is long because there’s 4 real case studies from my own consulting work that really help to illustrate the idea.Did I miss anything from this section? I think the meat of the book is here.Chapter 5 - The Inner Life of IndependentsThis chapter is essential to ensuring that the book stays grounded and doesn’t come off too “finished” - the infinite game of being an indie consultant is ongoing and messy. This chapter will really explore those ideas of what it means to be an indie and how it feels.I, consultant (2,700 words) - this is the only full post I’ve written for this section that tries to explore the wreck of how it feels for me personally to use the word “consultant”. I think there’s some important ideas in here but this post didn’t come out quite how I wanted it to - I think it needs a rewrite. Maybe I’m too close to the problem to properly write this one :)Maybe one way to do this is fold in my post the power of labels (1,000 words) that uses references from folks like Robin Sloan (media inventor).Another post that I have in draft right now is all about managing your time (but really, managing your energy) as an indie. Working with a coach last year I came up with an energy matrix spreadsheet that I found super useful as a way to think through balancing work and life during a particularly busy period and I want to tell that story and explore idea of time tracking, calendaring and scheduling for indies. This post is in draft right now and called “the jigsaw of independence” but that might change…Finally, the very reason I’m writing this book is as a way to create a narrative thread through an otherwise disconnected set of client projects. This is important for a few reasons: so you can create some notion of personal learning and development but also so that you can deliberately learn and grow and not feel like it’s a treadmill of one client project after the next. Maybe this post would be called “of ladders and treadmills” or something.Anyway - would love your annotations, comments and tweets on this outline. What is resonating? What is missing? As you can see I’m probably 60% of the way through writing the book at least in terms of raw word count (there’s obviously an editing process to turn a set of blog posts into a book).Thanks!"

Please annotate all over it with ideas and suggestions!Chapter 1 - Intro and overviewThis will be… some kind of intro I suppose! Most of these ideas are explored in my post The Strategic Independent (4,700 words) including:  The foundational frame of “work in context”  The interplay between strategy work and execution that allows you to retain clients for 12-18+ months at a time  What “strategy and stewardship” is and how I think about it  How to learn to be more strategic in your work and how to deliberately learn from client engagements  Only letting clients “in the strategy door” as a way to find good work and avoid issues later onChapter 2 - From Networking to NetworkedThis chapter will cover the messy reality of finding clients and what it means to be “networked” not “do networking”. There are two posts I’ve written here already:Small b blogging (1,800 words) - although this post wasn’t deliberately part of my strategy writing there’s a re-write of this post that explores networked writing (aka blogging) for indie consultants. The core of the idea is to write for community and connection, not mass appeal. It references the idea from Venkatesh of “release, rework, reference”          For those not sleeping at the back of class you might notice this post itself is a great example of reworking and referencing my own work!        When I re-write this small-b-blogging concept in the context of indie consulting I should explore some concrete examples from other indie consultants to better demonstrate the idea in practice I think.Strange Attraction (3,000 words) - this post explores how I think about “lead generation” for my consulting work and contains a bunch of examples. The core concept being that building networks of interesting peers and then keeping them up to date with your work and how you work can generate warm intros which is the holy grail of consulting.I think there’s one more post in this series (unwritten today) exploring the idea of “trust totems” - i.e. reference objects that give potential clients confidence that you’re an expert and allow them to find purchase on what you do. Things like books, how to guides, conference talks etc all act as trust totems and many mid-career consultants will have these by default. But it’s important to understand that case studies kind of don’t count here! It’s more important to show rather than tell here.Chapter 3 - Bridging the GapThis chapter is all about going from warm lead to long-term retainer and all of the things that go into that. Broadly I think there are two concepts to flesh out here (neither of which I’ve written yet):The idea of workshops as portals into organizations. Something I’ve mentioned informally to a lot of folks and always seems to be useful is that I try and start all my consulting engagements with a workshop. Not a structured learning workshop but a free-jazz exploration of the problem space. These workshops are like magic portals that get you inside the client’s organization very fast and also begin building bridges so that you can close a larger ongoing retainer much more easily for two reasons: you have more context for the problem and you already built trust with the client.Some kind of post exploring sales, how to structure a proposal, how to write an SOW etc. I don’t consider myself an expert here so I’m not 100% sure what take I’m going to have here but I think it’s a common pain point so I want to try and approach this in a way that hasn’t quite been covered before. Perhaps by exploring the emotional and inner anguish that comes with money talk and invoicing?Chapter 4 - Effective Strategy WorkI’m pretty obsessed with doing effective strategy work. Work beyond powerpoints and documents - work that actually transforms and changes organizations. This chapter will explore how to do good work for clients, while recognizing that it’s hard to actually bring about change for clients. This is probably where I’ve done the most writing to date:High fidelity consulting (1,000 words) - “Ideas without details and details without ideas are both risky”. This concept is all about moving beyond documents to a higher fidelity of work to enable you to be more provocative and useful with your outputs. This post is a short sketch of a longer piece that would explore more real examples of how I’ve done this in my own work.How to get things done (500 words) - there’s a few provocative ideas in this post that need exploring and expanding. Most notably the deck linked here that really gets into the heart of the idea that “Amateurs talk about strategy. Professionals talk about logistics”. Again, when I flesh this post out to be a longer piece I need to bring in more real examples from my own work.Yes! and… - “How to think on your feet without bullshitting”. I’ve got an analogy in my head around why improv comedy is much like consulting. Thinking on your feet, making things up without resorting to outright bullshit, keeping the focus of a room and so on. This post is not yet written, so let me know what you want to see in this post!Strategy is the organic flow of ideas and people (900 words) - here we start to expand our idea of what kind of work we’re hired for in the first place and recognize that it’s all about the people. The title of this post is taken from an excellent paper by Stripe Partners and there’s lots more thining to do here. I think I can fold my idea of “shadow org charts” and how to understand power flows inside client’s teams inside this piece to make something compelling.The consultant’s grain (2,500 words) - the piece that started it all! This piece is grounded in the insight that “(their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast”. It’s crucial to recognize which recommendations and strategies will go with the organization’s grain and which will go against the grain. Very different approaches are needed for each situation. This post is getting old now and likely needs a re-write but I’m still mostly happy with it.Ways of seeing (3,800 words) - this was the first piece I wrote as a deliberate longer form beginning of my book writing practice. It’s the sequel to the consultant’s grain piece above. This covers how you actually understand and recognize an organization’s culture and embraces the idea that perhaps the pinnacle of consulting work is to help your clients to see in new ways.How (and why) to roll your own frameworks in consulting engagements (5,000 words) - you could easily imagine this as the third part of a mini-trilogy directly following on from the two posts above. Ff teaching clients ways of seeing is important, this post shows you how to actually do it and walks through some pitfalls I’ve fallen into in my own work trying to rely on off the shelf frameworks. This post is long because there’s 4 real case studies from my own consulting work that really help to illustrate the idea.Did I miss anything from this section? I think the meat of the book is here.Chapter 5 - The Inner Life of IndependentsThis chapter is essential to ensuring that the book stays grounded and doesn’t come off too “finished” - the infinite game of being an indie consultant is ongoing and messy. This chapter will really explore those ideas of what it means to be an indie and how it feels.I, consultant (2,700 words) - this is the only full post I’ve written for this section that tries to explore the wreck of how it feels for me personally to use the word “consultant”. I think there’s some important ideas in here but this post didn’t come out quite how I wanted it to - I think it needs a rewrite. Maybe I’m too close to the problem to properly write this one :)Maybe one way to do this is fold in my post the power of labels (1,000 words) that uses references from folks like Robin Sloan (media inventor).Another post that I have in draft right now is all about managing your time (but really, managing your energy) as an indie. Working with a coach last year I came up with an energy matrix spreadsheet that I found super useful as a way to think through balancing work and life during a particularly busy period and I want to tell that story and explore idea of time tracking, calendaring and scheduling for indies. This post is in draft right now and called “the jigsaw of independence” but that might change…Finally, the very reason I’m writing this book is as a way to create a narrative thread through an otherwise disconnected set of client projects. This is important for a few reasons: so you can create some notion of personal learning and development but also so that you can deliberately learn and grow and not feel like it’s a treadmill of one client project after the next. Maybe this post would be called “of ladders and treadmills” or something.Anyway - would love your annotations, comments and tweets on this outline. What is resonating? What is missing? As you can see I’m probably 60% of the way through writing the book at least in terms of raw word count (there’s obviously an editing process to turn a set of blog posts into a book).Thanks!"

Design teams have been working this way for a long time. But in my work (which is lots of things but rarely design) printing things and putting things on the wall is a mostly forgotten discipline.I first encounted this during my time working at the Google Creative Lab which was kind of famous within Google for it’s hallway of work where foam boards 10 feet high lined the walls with projects pinned up on the wall.In a later presentation Stone Librande actually explores this by extending the idea of a one page design to a one wall design:And later a one hall design (this is a lot like what the Google Creative Lab used to look like):Where next?Leaving the Creative Lab (2013ish) I was disenchanted by the lack of rigor to the strategy work - almost everything pinned to a wall was a design.

  "date": "June 27, 2019",
  "content": "In this post I’m going to argue that bringing pre-existing off-the-shelf models and frameworks to my client work is the biggest mistake I’ve made in the past two years.A framework as I’m going to refer to it in this post is essentially a useful abstraction. A tool for thinking about a situation that allows teams to use a shared mental model and a shared vocabulary.In my post ways of seeing - I explored the idea of deeply understanding a client’s organization and culture to better understand how they see the world.  I ended with the idea that “teaching a client new ways of seeing is the pinnacle of consulting”.But how exactly do you teach clients how to see?The answer is frameworks. Douglas Hofstadter claims analogy is the core of cognition1 and I’d stretch that to say frameworks are the core of cognition for organizations.A good framework is a tool for thinking. A shared mental model of a situation is powerful and deeply transformative, especially at the management layer where they spend most of their time in abstractions.Something like aggregation theory from Ben Thompson is a good example of a pre-existing framework that you might be tempted to reference in client work.But, to be successful a good framework needs to be simple, true and co-created:  Simple because it needs to be easy to reference and talk about without having to explain it  True because it needs to be the right way of thinking about a situation - not just sound nice  Co-created with the client to ensure they have ownership and buy-inOff the shelf frameworks have a hard time meeting any of these three goals, and in particular can be dangerous when applied to the wrong problem. And it’s only recently that I really began to understand why existing generic frameworks like “jobs to be done” don’t meet my needs.A strong framework is a powerful tool.And for extra impact get good at naming them and embedding them in processes to achieve the outcomes they want.I’m going to try and walk through what this all means, show four case studies from my consulting work and end on some ways you can practice making frameworks.Definitions of Models &amp; FrameworksFirst, let’s lay the groundwork and set some definitions - in particular let’s try and differentiate between the concept of a “model” and a “framework”.The dictionary defines a framework as:a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide somethingThis is close to what we need - but doesn’t quite capture the notion of abstraction that I think is key for our uses. Let’s re-state as:A framework is a system of rules, ideas, beliefs or interactions that abstract a situation and can be used to make decisions.Frameworks are usually scale invariant. I.e. they abstract a system to its core relations, categories and interactions. Then, we can think of a model as a framework that allows for calculation with inputs and outputs:A model is an analytical framework - i.e. one that embeds an algorithm or set of calculations such that inputs and outputs can be adjusted to interrogate the system.I realize this is slightly hard to parse and in fact there are so many different uses for the words framework and model. In particular - I think of a “mental model” as actually most of the time being a framework2.Mostly for this post I’m just going to use the word “framework” everywhere - it’s loose but lets us talk about them all together. They’re all tools for thinking. They’re all in the consultant’s toolkit.Intro: Why frameworks are so powerfulFrameworks are powerful. They help us make sense of situations3:  But frameworks are more than mere representations. As Dubberley suggested, we use frameworks to make sense of and think through the world. A framework can help us break down the constituent elements in a phenomenon – or group of phenomena - which then makes it easier to think about their inter-relationships.And, they help us communicate more easily about those situations:  Yet beyond being (cognitive) labour saving devices frameworks have another obvious virtue. They provide a shared intellectual scaffolding: a common ground upon which people can interact and engage. In that sense frameworks have communicative virtuosity - they are good to talk with. They allow ideas to be shared.Both quotes from this excellent short read: Models of enchantment and the enchantment of models from Simon Roberts.The essence of consulting is navigating unfamiliar organizations to both make sense of existing beliefs, systems and processes while simultaneously helping the organization develop new beliefs, systems and processes. This dual process of sensing and changing is a delicate one.Unless you’re operating with a team of 4 analytical consultants (like a Bain or McKinsey might) there’s basically no way you can perform a “from first principles” analysis of the client’s organization4. So you’re going to need some shortcuts.Frameworks provide the shortcut to making sense of an organization and for proposing and socializing new ideas.But as is always the case with shortcuts, you need to choose your path wisely. Things that look like shortcuts can get you lost…The Failure of Pre-existing frameworksThe biggest mistake I’ve made is bringing pre-existing frameworks with me to a client gig. Pre-existing frameworks are problematic for two reasons:  a) They’re typically the wrong framework  b) They’re usually overly complexPre-existing frameworks are often complex tools. They’re designed to handle many different situations and organizations within a “master” framework so necessarily have to handle many edge cases and environments. They’re complex by design.But this complexity often means they get used incorrectly.Let’s take one I see a lot - the “jobs to be done” framework. I hear this referenced on almost every client project I work on in some context. But typically it’s the wrong framework because we’re not analyzing a complete jobs to be done analysis but instead we’re analyzing a specific user need or a functional UX. Yes you could use the JTBD framework here but it’s heavy handed.Secondly - it’s overly complex. The JTBD framework is nuanced, layered and comes with tons of theory5.And, by the way, if you’re using an off-the-shelf framework like JTBD then you’re missing the chance to name your own framework. This dramatically reduces the influence you can have within an organization.The Power of Simple FrameworksSo if jobs-to-be-done is too complex, what’s a good simple framework?I’d propose that for most indie consultants and strategic independents the right complexity is a single idea or concept. Create the most reduced, simple, brain-dead framework that you can find and stick to it.Jan Chipchase outlines this tension nicely (bolding mine):  “A framework is a way of organising information that supports comprehension and recall. A well-designed framework can communicate both simple and complex ideas without overwhelming the reader. While there are many widely used frameworks that have stood the test of time, every project has unique raw materials that can lead to something new.  A framework, even one that appears at first glance to be mundane, has the potential to reveal the world in a new light.  It takes time to tease out the optimal framework, from the first inkling of an idea run by the team to stress-testing the model to see it if stands up to new data. Novices tend to become enamoured by high-concept/low-data frameworks that take an additional cognitive effort to process and are light on insight.”6Simple frameworks are easier to communicate, travel faster inside an organization and have fewer barriers to adoption. But what Jan highlights here is that novices become enamoured with high-concept/low-data frameworks - or frameworks that tease the wrong insight.High concept frameworks are almost by definition worthless - a framework is an abstraction designed for simplifying and socializing an idea and if it’s hard to grok then it doesn’t help people think or help it spread.Frameworks that tease the wrong insight are what I call “un-true” frameworks and they’re another story…How to create true frameworksUn-true frameworks are things that sound nice but simply aren’t saying the right thing7. This is partly why off-the-shelf frameworks are dangerous, because they likely don’t say the thing that the organization needs.True frameworks are those that are grounded in a very real, practical and necessary insight about the organization, their users or the situation at hand.This idea of a “true framework” is something that I picked up at a recent sensemaking for impact masterclass from Jan Chipchase of Studio D fame.Jan walked through his process of turning raw ethnographic interviews into insights and frameworks in a way that generates a throughline from raw research to final deliverable.  It looks something like this:He showed a wall covered in insights gathered from field research - these interviews had generated a ton of little snippets of ideas - these could be insights, quotes or other nuggets. Where every single insight is tagged to the original specific interview that generated it so there’s a throughline from raw interviews to final presentation / output.He then showed a time-lapse of the sense-making process of turning that wall of insights into clusters of themes. These clusters are what I think most people imagine the sense-making process looks like; conduct interviews, extract insights, cluster and present.But there was a third wall in the time-lapse video - one for frameworks.The frameworks wall is nothing more than sheets of A4 paper with sharpie doodles, diagrams and ideas on them. The rule is that you start making a simple line sketch or even just a name for a potential framework - one per page. And during the course of the user research process you refine the frameworks and get rid of the ones that are too complicated or non essential.Then the crucial step happens last - as the field research nears an end you take stock of the frameworks on the wall and for those that you want to include in the final report you stress-test those frameworks in-field with real users. This ensures that the frameworks are true - they contain real things that map to real users expectations, behaviours and ideas8.Here’s an example framework from some Studio D work9:If you look you can imagine the process here from interviews with farmers -&gt; insights -&gt; frameworks like the above.Why is this important for consultants? Because it shows the power, and the difficulty, of creating true frameworks. Things that have the power to change an organization in the right way and that are tested with real users.True Frameworks emerge from client-ethnographiesI imagine most indie consultants and strategic independents are looking at this like I’m crazy - who has time for a multi-week ethnographic study in the middle of your consulting work?But here’s the thing - every time you’re on-site with a client’s organization you’re studying the people, the behaviours, the motivations. You’re asking questions of as many people as you can.This is all a light-touch ethnographic study of the client’s organization.I’ve written before about the need to get close enough to a client to understand the “grain” of the organization. You can see how without this close-sensing of the client it’s impossible to pick up on the ethnographies needed to construct these frameworks.Categorization is for expertsScanning the kinds of frameworks that Jan Chipchase showed from his work it was clear that while some were novel diagrams or well designed maps, the majority of them seemed like very simple tables and charts. Like this10:See how the simple categorization above of day labourers allows for the creation of new language (“Archetype 06 - Risk-averse Day Labourer”) and a lens through which future data sets, decisions and problems can be viewed.But it’s not obvious exactly why these dimensions were chosen on which to categorize day labourers. Why segment them by the length of their world view?The answer is that categorization is an expert skill.You need to be able to comprehend an entire system to be able to categorize things effectively11.A categorization in turn can embed and scale your expertise across an organization.In cases where the consultant has some domain expertise (not always true) and they’re coming in to help an organization adapt or build new processes the first go-to tool should be a simple categorization. Simple of course, refers to the simplicity of the framework, not of the knowledge and expertise that went into choosing the categorization.But as an expert you can’t simply force your expertise on the client. Instead you need to build the framework together…Co-creating frameworks makes them stick - aka the IKEA effectWe’ve shown that we want to make our own frameworks, they should be true and they should often be simple categorizations. Now, I want to show you how co-creating them with clients is the ultimate key to allowing them to be socialized, adopted, referenced and ultimately drive change in an organization sometimes for years to come.This is the IKEA effect - the idea that you’re much more invested in cheap furniture that you built with your own hands than fancy furniture that comes pre-assembled12.The same is true for frameworks. It’s ok to do the work of sensemaking on your own but it’s better to do it with the client. If you co-create it with the client you get three pleasing effects:  Firstly you avoid almost-true frameworks. The client almost certainly knows more than you do and has an awareness for the corporate memory so can help you avoid evolutionary dead ends that might not be immediately obvious.  Secondly by co-creating with the client you get at least one senior member of the organization fully immersed in the theory, not just the summary of the framework. Remember frameworks are abstractions - by design - but you want at least someone who understands the whole system not just the abstraction  Thirdly, because the client co-created it with you they are proud of their work and far more likely to use, reference and share the framework than if you hand it to them fully formed.An example of a simple, co-created categorization framework embedded in a processHere’s a real example from some client work last year.Problem: the client is creating a bunch of content and looking to scale up their content production but their existing performance is very mixed and overall not meeting expectations.Solution: frameworks to the rescue! (how did you guess I was going to say that?)After a day or so workshop with the client and the editor in chief we co-created a simple categorization for their content to better help them the user intent for a keyword before they created the content.The categorization looked something like this:And this gets embedded and referenced in the master content schedule by assigning every article a grade (A,B,C,D in the second column) or categorization:This framework helped them write stronger briefs, invest more strongly into areas of competition and also track and monitor performance on a more granular level.Importantly - note the difference here between a situation where as the consultant you say “you should make better content” and a day-long process of understanding the failure of their existing content process, co-creating a simple categorization, testing that categorization against historical data and then creating the changes in the process doc and working that through with the editor in chief.An example of an accidental framework that became socializedHere’s another example of a more visual framework. Also from my own work last year. This one was an accidental success (and really was the genesis for all of my framework thinking since).A large media company needed to get better at commerce content fast. They needed a better understanding of how it worked and a better plan for executing it.I put together a strategy deck (30-40 slides maybe) and, in reality the whole thing could be boiled down to “slide 6” which stopped the meeting dead and became the reference object for the whole project. Here it is:This is simple, but importantly it’s TRUE. Note the 70/30 revenue split? These numbers were based on another property they owned so they had reason to believe it and think it a true framework.It’s… deceptively simple. And actually pretty hard to do in practice (despite everyone buying into the strategy from top to bottom they ended up completely ignoring the box on the far right. Oh well.)One thing missing here was a good name - over time it was referenced as “slide 6” (it wasn’t slide 6) or “that diagram you showed”. This is clearly sub-optimal and I think a better name (especially one that emphasized the holistic nature of doing all of this at once) would have helped the framework get executed fully.An example of a simple framework that creates a modelHere’s a lovely simple example I’ve referenced many times over the past few years.Problem: a client needed a way to maintain content quality as they scaled up dramatically. They published long-form product reviews.After locking ourselves in a room for a day (notice a common theme?) we flipped the concept of defining quality and instead created a minimum threshold for our content to meet:Does this benchmark seem overly simple to you? Good! Five bullet points that allow you to grade a piece of content to say “this meets our standards or doesn’t” is exactly the simple useful thing we needed.Later, we translated this into a scoring system - get 4/5 people in a room and have them all rate the same article 1-10 on each of these bullets and you can say “this article is 7/10” and “this is 6.4 / 10”. This descriptive power is turning the abstract framework into a more quantitative model.And of course, note the co-creation.With great power… an example of a framework that made its own meaningWith great power comes great responsibility… Who recognizes the following situation: you present a body of work to an executive team and one item - either a throw-away phrase or a single idea “sticks” with an executive and they grab hold of the language and suddenly every meeting they’re in they’re using this one phrase, most of which is entirely out of context or irrelevant.I’ve definitely been in this situation. It’s painful for two reasons - firstly because your framework had a real use and a real intended meaning and that’s now impossible with the executive bastardization. But also - it causes confusion and frustration with the employees who can often recognize that the framework the exec is forcing on them doesn’t make a lot of sense.Here’s an example from a few years ago - in the middle of an exec strategy read out I referenced the hub, hero, habit framework:In truth - this was my fault. I’d had a longer strategy deck I’d prepared that got slimmed down and I’d left in the reference to the framework without the explanation of how it would work in application for that client.The fallout was that the “hub, hero, habit” framework was referenced by the leadership team in repeated ways but without any real directive, causing confusion for the teams. I don’t think any meaningful action happened as a result[empty].How do you get better at this? Doodling &amp; Diagrams.If you’ve read this far hopefully you’re bought into the idea that frameworks are useful and effective. So… how do you get better at making them?As I think about the last few years of my own work and I try and understand my own thinking I’ve come to the answer that doodling and diagrams are the way to evolve your thinking.You can think of it as something like:Doodles -&gt; Diagrams -&gt;  Frameworks -&gt; Models(Yes, this is a framework!)Here’s an example - this post:         View this post on Instagram           Posting doodles to my blog. tomcritchlow.com for all the noodling and doodling. A post shared by  Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) on Jul 25, 2018 at 7:19am PDTWas a simple doodle that turned into a mini framework of sorts for thinking through my consulting work and led to the idea of “media design”:  All the projects I’ve seen fail have failed because they have been too focused on one axis of the spectrum and the strategy or execution hasn’t acknowledged the full system - from ignoring the brand implications of the content to not fully understanding the human editors who have to execute a vision.  Media Design is about designing for success by looking at the system and how the parts interplay to make each perform better by bringing them into a shared context.I’ve been following and collecting interesting visual thinkers for a while and I’ve collected a few of my faves here:Venkatesh Rao - RibbonfarmVenkatesh consistently flirts with the boundaries of reality with his doodling, diagramming and thinking. One thing I love about his work is that he’s not afraid to switch between hand-drawn doodles, powerpoint diagrams and flowcharts (or any other medium you can think of).This one is a particular favorite of mine, quiver doodles:This recent post the extended internet universe actually has multiple different mediums of visual thinking - drawing, 2x2, constraint triangle.Nahee.App - (mildly NSFW)You didn’t think you were going to get through this post without some cyberfeminism did you? This is out of left field but it’s my hands-down favorite Instagram account right now. Feminism, sex, diagrams, process flows and more. Hard to describe and mildly NSFW but mind-expanding:Instagram: @nahee.appBen Thompson - StratecheryBen Thompson is pretty well known both for his doodles and for his frameworks. Here’s a diagram from his most famous aggregation theory:If you look at all of their work you can see how convoluted or involved ideas become simpler and simpler over time as they boil them to their essence. Aggregation theory is an excellent example of this from Ben Thompson. (but remember! The goal is to create your own frameworks, not stuff aggregation theory into every strategy deck you make).By the way these are all archived and will hopefully be maintained over on my wiki: wiki/diagrams and doodles.Naming Frameworks - Compress to ImpressA key factor for the success of frameworks is their ability to travel - the ability for a simple framework to be repeated, referenced and leaned on while you’re not in the room.Giving your framework a strong name is essential to the spread of the concept - and Eugene Wei has an excellent post on this with the appropriately catchy title compress to impress:  “There will come a day when you’ll come up with some brilliant theory or concept and want it to spread and stick. You want to lay claim to that idea. It’s then that you’ll want to set aside some time to state it distinctively, even if you’re not a gifted rhetorician. A memorable turn of phrase need not incorporate sophisticated techniques like parataxis or polysyndeton. Most everyone in tech is familiar with Marc Andreessen’s “software is eating the world” and Stewart Brand’s “information wants to be free.” Often mere novelty is enough to elevate the mundane. You’ve spent all that time cooking your idea, why not spend an extra few moments plating it? It all tastes the same in your mouth but one dish will live on forever in an Instagram humblebrag pic.”So… do as Eugene says - spend a few minutes plating the framework13.This is an area that I’m deliberately trying to get better at (note how all of my above examples lacked good naming… ). Naming is not a strong suit of mine but I think studying language, poetry and memes is a good start…Two good resources for naming things (though both are slightly more focused on naming “brands” I think the concepts are solid):a 3-step process for naming by Ben PierattOnym - collection of naming resources.Models of Enchantment &amp; Embedding IdeologyThe wonderful article I quoted early in this post from Simon Roberts is going to crop up again here (bolding mine):  Models cause people to “perceive social reality in a way favourable to the social interests of the enchanter” (Gell 1988: 7). I’m sure we’d like to think that our interests are coterminous with those of the people we advise. More often than not I suspect they are. But isn’t it worth remembering the power our models have over those we provide them to and how they exert that power?  Perhaps more importantly it’s worth reflecting on the sometimes restrictive and constraining power that our models might exert over their creators. In pursuit of certainty in the face of uncertainty, is it not sometime the case that the enchanter becomes the enchanted?As per my older piece the consultant’s grain every time we enter a project we need to understand that we bring our own biases, ideas and ideologies to the table. And frameworks are an excellent way of embedding ideology inside an organization. So tread carefully.In summary…Thanks for sticking with me for this long-ish post. Like I mentioned early on - attempting to force pre-built frameworks into my consulting work has been a major error in the past few years and so I’m still course-correcting and relatively new to building my own. If I could explain this better I’d have written a shorter post…To recap where we got to:  Frameworks are simple tools for thinking that can create a shared world view and be easily referenced  The first instinct of many consultants is to grab a framework that you’ve heard of but this causes problems in three ways:          They’re too complex      They’re not relevant enough      You didn’t make it so there’s little attachment        Instead I believe you should be making your own frameworks and they you should focus on:          Simple frameworks (even a simple categorization is a framework)      True frameworks that say something about the client’s business      Co-creating them with clients so you get the IKEA effect        I’m still figuring it out but I believe doodling, sketching, notebook diagrams and visual thinking can help you get better at making frameworks  And, finally, for maximum effectiveness you need to focus on memorable names - compress to impress.How are you using frameworks in your work?

  "content": "In this post I’m going to argue that bringing pre-existing off-the-shelf models and frameworks to my client work is the biggest mistake I’ve made in the past two years.A framework as I’m going to refer to it in this post is essentially a useful abstraction. A tool for thinking about a situation that allows teams to use a shared mental model and a shared vocabulary.In my post ways of seeing - I explored the idea of deeply understanding a client’s organization and culture to better understand how they see the world.  I ended with the idea that “teaching a client new ways of seeing is the pinnacle of consulting”.But how exactly do you teach clients how to see?The answer is frameworks. Douglas Hofstadter claims analogy is the core of cognition1 and I’d stretch that to say frameworks are the core of cognition for organizations.A good framework is a tool for thinking. A shared mental model of a situation is powerful and deeply transformative, especially at the management layer where they spend most of their time in abstractions.Something like aggregation theory from Ben Thompson is a good example of a pre-existing framework that you might be tempted to reference in client work.But, to be successful a good framework needs to be simple, true and co-created:  Simple because it needs to be easy to reference and talk about without having to explain it  True because it needs to be the right way of thinking about a situation - not just sound nice  Co-created with the client to ensure they have ownership and buy-inOff the shelf frameworks have a hard time meeting any of these three goals, and in particular can be dangerous when applied to the wrong problem. And it’s only recently that I really began to understand why existing generic frameworks like “jobs to be done” don’t meet my needs.A strong framework is a powerful tool.And for extra impact get good at naming them and embedding them in processes to achieve the outcomes they want.I’m going to try and walk through what this all means, show four case studies from my consulting work and end on some ways you can practice making frameworks.Definitions of Models &amp; FrameworksFirst, let’s lay the groundwork and set some definitions - in particular let’s try and differentiate between the concept of a “model” and a “framework”.The dictionary defines a framework as:a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide somethingThis is close to what we need - but doesn’t quite capture the notion of abstraction that I think is key for our uses. Let’s re-state as:A framework is a system of rules, ideas, beliefs or interactions that abstract a situation and can be used to make decisions.Frameworks are usually scale invariant. I.e. they abstract a system to its core relations, categories and interactions. Then, we can think of a model as a framework that allows for calculation with inputs and outputs:A model is an analytical framework - i.e. one that embeds an algorithm or set of calculations such that inputs and outputs can be adjusted to interrogate the system.I realize this is slightly hard to parse and in fact there are so many different uses for the words framework and model. In particular - I think of a “mental model” as actually most of the time being a framework2.Mostly for this post I’m just going to use the word “framework” everywhere - it’s loose but lets us talk about them all together. They’re all tools for thinking. They’re all in the consultant’s toolkit.Intro: Why frameworks are so powerfulFrameworks are powerful. They help us make sense of situations3:  But frameworks are more than mere representations. As Dubberley suggested, we use frameworks to make sense of and think through the world. A framework can help us break down the constituent elements in a phenomenon – or group of phenomena - which then makes it easier to think about their inter-relationships.And, they help us communicate more easily about those situations:  Yet beyond being (cognitive) labour saving devices frameworks have another obvious virtue. They provide a shared intellectual scaffolding: a common ground upon which people can interact and engage. In that sense frameworks have communicative virtuosity - they are good to talk with. They allow ideas to be shared.Both quotes from this excellent short read: Models of enchantment and the enchantment of models from Simon Roberts.The essence of consulting is navigating unfamiliar organizations to both make sense of existing beliefs, systems and processes while simultaneously helping the organization develop new beliefs, systems and processes. This dual process of sensing and changing is a delicate one.Unless you’re operating with a team of 4 analytical consultants (like a Bain or McKinsey might) there’s basically no way you can perform a “from first principles” analysis of the client’s organization4. So you’re going to need some shortcuts.Frameworks provide the shortcut to making sense of an organization and for proposing and socializing new ideas.But as is always the case with shortcuts, you need to choose your path wisely. Things that look like shortcuts can get you lost…The Failure of Pre-existing frameworksThe biggest mistake I’ve made is bringing pre-existing frameworks with me to a client gig. Pre-existing frameworks are problematic for two reasons:  a) They’re typically the wrong framework  b) They’re usually overly complexPre-existing frameworks are often complex tools. They’re designed to handle many different situations and organizations within a “master” framework so necessarily have to handle many edge cases and environments. They’re complex by design.But this complexity often means they get used incorrectly.Let’s take one I see a lot - the “jobs to be done” framework. I hear this referenced on almost every client project I work on in some context. But typically it’s the wrong framework because we’re not analyzing a complete jobs to be done analysis but instead we’re analyzing a specific user need or a functional UX. Yes you could use the JTBD framework here but it’s heavy handed.Secondly - it’s overly complex. The JTBD framework is nuanced, layered and comes with tons of theory5.And, by the way, if you’re using an off-the-shelf framework like JTBD then you’re missing the chance to name your own framework. This dramatically reduces the influence you can have within an organization.The Power of Simple FrameworksSo if jobs-to-be-done is too complex, what’s a good simple framework?I’d propose that for most indie consultants and strategic independents the right complexity is a single idea or concept. Create the most reduced, simple, brain-dead framework that you can find and stick to it.Jan Chipchase outlines this tension nicely (bolding mine):  “A framework is a way of organising information that supports comprehension and recall. A well-designed framework can communicate both simple and complex ideas without overwhelming the reader. While there are many widely used frameworks that have stood the test of time, every project has unique raw materials that can lead to something new.  A framework, even one that appears at first glance to be mundane, has the potential to reveal the world in a new light.  It takes time to tease out the optimal framework, from the first inkling of an idea run by the team to stress-testing the model to see it if stands up to new data. Novices tend to become enamoured by high-concept/low-data frameworks that take an additional cognitive effort to process and are light on insight.”6Simple frameworks are easier to communicate, travel faster inside an organization and have fewer barriers to adoption. But what Jan highlights here is that novices become enamoured with high-concept/low-data frameworks - or frameworks that tease the wrong insight.High concept frameworks are almost by definition worthless - a framework is an abstraction designed for simplifying and socializing an idea and if it’s hard to grok then it doesn’t help people think or help it spread.Frameworks that tease the wrong insight are what I call “un-true” frameworks and they’re another story…How to create true frameworksUn-true frameworks are things that sound nice but simply aren’t saying the right thing7. This is partly why off-the-shelf frameworks are dangerous, because they likely don’t say the thing that the organization needs.True frameworks are those that are grounded in a very real, practical and necessary insight about the organization, their users or the situation at hand.This idea of a “true framework” is something that I picked up at a recent sensemaking for impact masterclass from Jan Chipchase of Studio D fame.Jan walked through his process of turning raw ethnographic interviews into insights and frameworks in a way that generates a throughline from raw research to final deliverable.  It looks something like this:He showed a wall covered in insights gathered from field research - these interviews had generated a ton of little snippets of ideas - these could be insights, quotes or other nuggets. Where every single insight is tagged to the original specific interview that generated it so there’s a throughline from raw interviews to final presentation / output.He then showed a time-lapse of the sense-making process of turning that wall of insights into clusters of themes. These clusters are what I think most people imagine the sense-making process looks like; conduct interviews, extract insights, cluster and present.But there was a third wall in the time-lapse video - one for frameworks.The frameworks wall is nothing more than sheets of A4 paper with sharpie doodles, diagrams and ideas on them. The rule is that you start making a simple line sketch or even just a name for a potential framework - one per page. And during the course of the user research process you refine the frameworks and get rid of the ones that are too complicated or non essential.Then the crucial step happens last - as the field research nears an end you take stock of the frameworks on the wall and for those that you want to include in the final report you stress-test those frameworks in-field with real users. This ensures that the frameworks are true - they contain real things that map to real users expectations, behaviours and ideas8.Here’s an example framework from some Studio D work9:If you look you can imagine the process here from interviews with farmers -&gt; insights -&gt; frameworks like the above.Why is this important for consultants? Because it shows the power, and the difficulty, of creating true frameworks. Things that have the power to change an organization in the right way and that are tested with real users.True Frameworks emerge from client-ethnographiesI imagine most indie consultants and strategic independents are looking at this like I’m crazy - who has time for a multi-week ethnographic study in the middle of your consulting work?But here’s the thing - every time you’re on-site with a client’s organization you’re studying the people, the behaviours, the motivations. You’re asking questions of as many people as you can.This is all a light-touch ethnographic study of the client’s organization.I’ve written before about the need to get close enough to a client to understand the “grain” of the organization. You can see how without this close-sensing of the client it’s impossible to pick up on the ethnographies needed to construct these frameworks.Categorization is for expertsScanning the kinds of frameworks that Jan Chipchase showed from his work it was clear that while some were novel diagrams or well designed maps, the majority of them seemed like very simple tables and charts. Like this10:See how the simple categorization above of day labourers allows for the creation of new language (“Archetype 06 - Risk-averse Day Labourer”) and a lens through which future data sets, decisions and problems can be viewed.But it’s not obvious exactly why these dimensions were chosen on which to categorize day labourers. Why segment them by the length of their world view?The answer is that categorization is an expert skill.You need to be able to comprehend an entire system to be able to categorize things effectively11.A categorization in turn can embed and scale your expertise across an organization.In cases where the consultant has some domain expertise (not always true) and they’re coming in to help an organization adapt or build new processes the first go-to tool should be a simple categorization. Simple of course, refers to the simplicity of the framework, not of the knowledge and expertise that went into choosing the categorization.But as an expert you can’t simply force your expertise on the client. Instead you need to build the framework together…Co-creating frameworks makes them stick - aka the IKEA effectWe’ve shown that we want to make our own frameworks, they should be true and they should often be simple categorizations. Now, I want to show you how co-creating them with clients is the ultimate key to allowing them to be socialized, adopted, referenced and ultimately drive change in an organization sometimes for years to come.This is the IKEA effect - the idea that you’re much more invested in cheap furniture that you built with your own hands than fancy furniture that comes pre-assembled12.The same is true for frameworks. It’s ok to do the work of sensemaking on your own but it’s better to do it with the client. If you co-create it with the client you get three pleasing effects:  Firstly you avoid almost-true frameworks. The client almost certainly knows more than you do and has an awareness for the corporate memory so can help you avoid evolutionary dead ends that might not be immediately obvious.  Secondly by co-creating with the client you get at least one senior member of the organization fully immersed in the theory, not just the summary of the framework. Remember frameworks are abstractions - by design - but you want at least someone who understands the whole system not just the abstraction  Thirdly, because the client co-created it with you they are proud of their work and far more likely to use, reference and share the framework than if you hand it to them fully formed.An example of a simple, co-created categorization framework embedded in a processHere’s a real example from some client work last year.Problem: the client is creating a bunch of content and looking to scale up their content production but their existing performance is very mixed and overall not meeting expectations.Solution: frameworks to the rescue! (how did you guess I was going to say that?)After a day or so workshop with the client and the editor in chief we co-created a simple categorization for their content to better help them the user intent for a keyword before they created the content.The categorization looked something like this:And this gets embedded and referenced in the master content schedule by assigning every article a grade (A,B,C,D in the second column) or categorization:This framework helped them write stronger briefs, invest more strongly into areas of competition and also track and monitor performance on a more granular level.Importantly - note the difference here between a situation where as the consultant you say “you should make better content” and a day-long process of understanding the failure of their existing content process, co-creating a simple categorization, testing that categorization against historical data and then creating the changes in the process doc and working that through with the editor in chief.An example of an accidental framework that became socializedHere’s another example of a more visual framework. Also from my own work last year. This one was an accidental success (and really was the genesis for all of my framework thinking since).A large media company needed to get better at commerce content fast. They needed a better understanding of how it worked and a better plan for executing it.I put together a strategy deck (30-40 slides maybe) and, in reality the whole thing could be boiled down to “slide 6” which stopped the meeting dead and became the reference object for the whole project. Here it is:This is simple, but importantly it’s TRUE. Note the 70/30 revenue split? These numbers were based on another property they owned so they had reason to believe it and think it a true framework.It’s… deceptively simple. And actually pretty hard to do in practice (despite everyone buying into the strategy from top to bottom they ended up completely ignoring the box on the far right. Oh well.)One thing missing here was a good name - over time it was referenced as “slide 6” (it wasn’t slide 6) or “that diagram you showed”. This is clearly sub-optimal and I think a better name (especially one that emphasized the holistic nature of doing all of this at once) would have helped the framework get executed fully.An example of a simple framework that creates a modelHere’s a lovely simple example I’ve referenced many times over the past few years.Problem: a client needed a way to maintain content quality as they scaled up dramatically. They published long-form product reviews.After locking ourselves in a room for a day (notice a common theme?) we flipped the concept of defining quality and instead created a minimum threshold for our content to meet:Does this benchmark seem overly simple to you? Good! Five bullet points that allow you to grade a piece of content to say “this meets our standards or doesn’t” is exactly the simple useful thing we needed.Later, we translated this into a scoring system - get 4/5 people in a room and have them all rate the same article 1-10 on each of these bullets and you can say “this article is 7/10” and “this is 6.4 / 10”. This descriptive power is turning the abstract framework into a more quantitative model.And of course, note the co-creation.With great power… an example of a framework that made its own meaningWith great power comes great responsibility… Who recognizes the following situation: you present a body of work to an executive team and one item - either a throw-away phrase or a single idea “sticks” with an executive and they grab hold of the language and suddenly every meeting they’re in they’re using this one phrase, most of which is entirely out of context or irrelevant.I’ve definitely been in this situation. It’s painful for two reasons - firstly because your framework had a real use and a real intended meaning and that’s now impossible with the executive bastardization. But also - it causes confusion and frustration with the employees who can often recognize that the framework the exec is forcing on them doesn’t make a lot of sense.Here’s an example from a few years ago - in the middle of an exec strategy read out I referenced the hub, hero, habit framework:In truth - this was my fault. I’d had a longer strategy deck I’d prepared that got slimmed down and I’d left in the reference to the framework without the explanation of how it would work in application for that client.The fallout was that the “hub, hero, habit” framework was referenced by the leadership team in repeated ways but without any real directive, causing confusion for the teams. I don’t think any meaningful action happened as a result[empty].How do you get better at this?

Perhaps more importantly it’s worth reflecting on the sometimes restrictive and constraining power that our models might exert over their creators. In pursuit of certainty in the face of uncertainty, is it not sometime the case that the enchanter becomes the enchanted?As per my older piece the consultant’s grain every time we enter a project we need to understand that we bring our own biases, ideas and ideologies to the table. And frameworks are an excellent way of embedding ideology inside an organization. So tread carefully.In summary…Thanks for sticking with me for this long-ish post. Like I mentioned early on - attempting to force pre-built frameworks into my consulting work has been a major error in the past few years and so I’m still course-correcting and relatively new to building my own. If I could explain this better I’d have written a shorter post…To recap where we got to:  Frameworks are simple tools for thinking that can create a shared world view and be easily referenced  The first instinct of many consultants is to grab a framework that you’ve heard of but this causes problems in three ways:          They’re too complex      They’re not relevant enough      You didn’t make it so there’s little attachment        Instead I believe you should be making your own frameworks and they you should focus on:          Simple frameworks (even a simple categorization is a framework)      True frameworks that say something about the client’s business      Co-creating them with clients so you get the IKEA effect        I’m still figuring it out but I believe doodling, sketching, notebook diagrams and visual thinking can help you get better at making frameworks  And, finally, for maximum effectiveness you need to focus on memorable names - compress to impress.How are you using frameworks in your work? Leave a comment below, drop me an email (tjcritchlow@gmail.com) or hit me up on Twitter (@tomcritchlow)! Thanks.–Much thanks to all of the folks who reviewed early drafts and left notes and feedback including Luke Stevens, Elan Miller, Brian Dell, Will Critchlow, Nitzan Hermon and more.            If you want to dive down this rabbit hole there’s a lengthy but very approachable piece here: analogy as the core of cognition (PDF). &#8617;              For more on this rabbit hole there’s a longer conversation around the distinction between a framework and a model in this Twitter thread with myself, Brian and Venkatesh. &#8617;              I took the liberty of changing these quotes to swap the word ‘model’ for ‘framework’ to fit my definitions and make these quotes flow easier &#8617;              My brother Will pointed out that the big consulting firms are some of the biggest framework dealers around. He’s right of course - shortcuts and ‘first principles analysis’ are not mutually exclusive &#8617;              There’s a free 209 page PDF here for those that are interested in learning more about the Jobs to be Done framework: whencoffeeandkalecompete.com &#8617;              Page 383 of The Field Study Handbook by Jan Chipchase &#8617;              Remember that by definition every framework is leaky. The trick is to tease apart the right part of the situation to abstract. For more on that read this great piece the law of leaky abstractions by Joel. &#8617;              Jan weighed in on Twitter with some additional thoughts and notes in this thread. &#8617;              Studio D put together a report called Paddy to Plate and this is an image from page 107 &#8617;              Page 133 from Paddy to Plate &#8617;              It seems there’s a fair amount of academic research that backs this up and I found these great quotes: ‘Experts notice features and meaningful patterns of information that are not noticed by novices.’ and ‘Experts’ knowledge cannot be reduced to sets of isolated facts or propositions but, instead, reflects contexts of applicability: that is, the knowledge is ‘conditionalized’ on a set of circumstances.’ Both of these from How People Learn - Chapter: 2 How Experts Differ from Novices &#8617;              This is a real thing by the way - look it up: the IKEA effect &#8617;              In his post Eugene references the idea that every year at Amazon there’s a named ‘theme’. I wonder if naming client engagements is an untapped area of opportunity to frame the work… &#8617;      "

  "title": "The Strategic Independent",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/",
  "date": "April 4, 2019",
  "content": "In this post I want to break down what I mean by “strategic independent” and why, whatever path you’re on and expertise you have, you can bring more value for yourself and your clients by thinking strategically.We’ll walk through:  What strategic work is - by looking at a variety of contexts you might work within and how to spot them.  Why strategic work is better - both for you and the client, offering more value to them and being more interesting for you.  How strategic work enables you to charge more - and keep clients retained for longer, a compounding effect on your ability to charge more.  How you can begin to think strategically - offering some real examples from my own career.Finally, how being independent offers more value for your clients by enabling you to gain adjacent context that your client might not be able to see and that we get this adjacent from our network - and therefore we should really think of being codependent with our network.Onwards…Strategic work is work-in-contextClient work can be frustrating:Ever had a project cancelled without notice?Ever had to go through endless revisions and feel like you’re not getting it?Ever had a project stall before it even started because you can’t agree on the exact deliverables?Ever had a piece of work never get implemented by a client?But frustration is a two player game - when you’re frustrated that work doesn’t make sense - the client is likely frustrated that your work doesn’t meet their objectives well enough.Context is the key.Even before I start working with a client in the very first meeting I always make sure I ask questions about business model, team structure, company priorities and more. These don’t always feel relevant to the specific request but help me better map out both the work I need to do and the stakeholders that need to see it.The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context1.Overlapping contextsSo when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts2.However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:Every project exists in multiple overlapping contexts - here’s some of the types of context to look for:  People (who are the stakeholders? what do they care about?)  Resources (what can they realistically do with your work?)  Brand (what is the position of the company?)  Marketing (audiences, channels, analytics)  Business model (revenue, profit)  Product (how does their product work, what is possible?)  The user (who is the user? What do they care about?)Your work likely overlaps at least partly with all of these ideas - but also depending on your specific work you might have different contexts and add more nuance.Strategic work is better workOnce you understand the concentric circles within which your work happens you’ll be able do work that’s more effective and useful for your clients.Two examples from my own work:  Example #1  I was working as a marketing advisor for a client and early in the engagement (partly because we were discussing me becoming the full-time CMO) I was invited to sit in on their quarterly board meeting. This experience was formative in better understanding the drivers and motivations of the business - by understanding who literally owned the business better. This context was crucial for proposing work and for ensuring that pitching that work to the board was smooth. The CEO gave me some of the necessary context but by attending that board meeting I got a vantage point that I didn’t realize existed previously.  Example #2  Last year I was working with a client to integrate an acquisition into the main business - in particular to ensure that one business function was working correctly. My north star and most of the language in the team was about revenue projections for the function. Makes sense. But, I discovered that actually the SVP’s OKR for the quarter was ensuring that the business unit was functioning smoothly. While revenue was obviously a thing that they cared about, the more important context was around process and communication around that process. Once I had this context everything became easier since I could be more closely aligned with the objectives of the business.Catastrophic Events &amp; Context CollapseThere’s a certain kind of experience that I want to describe where everything goes to shit. Certain events in business collapse the environment. For example - let’s take that context model for app design from earlier in the post. But let’s assume that the growth objectives are “in crisis” - this could be missing targets, people change, overspend, change in marketing strategy etcThese catastrophic events collapse the environment and cascade downwards. Every circle inside gets ignored, paused, cancelled, changed, redefined. These events are felt like system-shock for anyone operating in these lower circlesBut for those above the fire-line there are two things that are crucial:  Their objectives and priorities haven’t changed much, they’re still operating within the same context they were previously (although they may feel some turbulence)  They likely knew about the catastrophic event ahead of time. They may even have been responsible for causing the catastrophic event.We’ve likely all been personally inside a context as it collapses - either as a full time employee or a consultant / agency partner. It’s not fun.Riding these crashes is a skill that I think in theory you can get good at - learning how to sprint at a moments notice in a new direction and operate supernaturally fast in a crashing environment.But I think it’s way easier to instead always be searching upwards for more context awareness - i.e. working strategically. This helps you ride out those catastrophic events with more planning, awareness and foresight.Strategic work is better paidIn addition to being better work (for clients and for you) - strategic work is also better paid.As an independent - you’ll hear a lot of advice boil down to “charge more”. I’ve even said it myself! And it’s true - it’s the best advice you can get. Except… it’s kind of empty advice. I don’t think it provides much direction for how exactly you go about doing it.Translating executional work into strategic work is a framework that I think gives concrete ways of continually ratcheting up the price &amp; value of your work.The key idea is that at every layer of context there are new kinds of work - and by reaching for associated layers of context you can get involved in new kinds of work that are associated with and grounded in the thing you know but also a slight stretch.Not only can you charge more because the work is more useful, impactful and better but you can also charge for the associated parts of uncovering context - workshops, user research, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews etc.Let’s look at two examples:Scenario #1 - From Writing to Strategic WritingLet’s imagine you’re a writer - commissioned to write for a client’s branded content site. Let’s say you get paid $200 per article. The work: writing. How might we think of writing-in-context? Here’s a list of context that you should ask for and where it’s not available or it’s done poorly offer to step in:  Creating a style guide for all the writers  User research for end users to uncover what they want to read (e.g. by creating personas)  Competitive analysis for other branded content sites, who writes for them and how they operate  A content marketing plan for the branded content site  A content marketing plan across the whole brand  Themed content franchises that can scale beyond individual posts  SEO research into keywords they care about targetingScenario #2 - From UX Research to Strategic ResearchLet’s imagine you’re a UX researcher - creating user research from real users for clients. The work: creating user research projects, finding relevant users and running them. This is likely reasonably well-paid work as-is but let’s look at ways we might take this UX-research and place it in-context:  Creating a set of product principles based off user research  Reviewing a product roadmap  Running a design sprint internally to ideate new product ideas (grounded in user research experience of course)  Proposing a broader marketing focus group studySome more examples of how work and associated context work might fit together:  Work: email copywriter -&gt; context: brand voice document  Work: paid marketing -&gt; context: paid marketing dashboard creation  Work: marketing strategy -&gt; context: hiring a marketing teamI’ve got a very loose working theory that every time you expand your context-circles you get paid an order of magnitude more money.It’s not unreasonable to imagine:  Writing: $200 / article  Style guide: $2,000  Content strategy: $20,000These are necessarily imperfect analogies and will vary wildly from industry to industry3, but here’s a specific callout as you start to bundle “the work” and “the context”:Don’t give the context work away for free. In fact, do the opposite - charge more for it than your regular work.I see this often with more junior or less confident independents - you’re trying to close “the work” and so you throw in “the context” for free or as a sweetener.Don’t do this! Work-in-context is typically more expensive than regular work so don’t be afraid to price it separately and confidently. Don’t worry if the client doesn’t bite at first - strategic work is only valuable at certain inflection points (see below graphs) but they’ll remember that you offered it and it’ll come back around.Strategy and Stewardship - a framework for retaining clients for a long timeSo we’ve established that you can get paid more money for strategic work - and now I want to show you that the new higher rates you’re charging can also last longer. A compounding effect on your pricing power.I learned about the model of Strategy &amp; Stewardship from the Helsinki Design Lab:  It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop4Their solution? Strategy and stewardship:  We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural steward5This idea of a feedback loop between strategy and implementation is one I’ve taken to heart. It maps directly to my mental model of a typical long-term retained client relationship.Imagine a 12-month client retainer with the strategic work in green and the implementation in blue:You can see that (roughly) the total amount of work is constant but there is a phase shift from strategy at the beginning to mostly execution &amp; implementation (stewardship) and then a hard shift back into strategic work.If you look at strategy on its own:There are two key things to draw from this chart:The long-term work begins with strategic work, so if you want to get involved in a project early (a common request) you have to be thinking and working strategically.But importantly, if you only do strategy work the client isn’t going to keep you around for months 3-12.  No matter how lucrative that strategy work is, if you’re not shifting your outputs to implementation/stewardship then there isn’t enough work for either you or the client to justify sticking around and so you end up with a short sprint of a project.Now, if you look at execution on it’s own:There are two key drawbacks to only doing implementation/execution work:Firstly - notice how the blue line shoots up a few months into the project? When you’re only working on the execution/implementation you get called into the project too late - the strategy is already set.Secondly - notice how at some point in the future, the client either pauses, reviews or changes their strategy and the project unexpectedly ends? This can seem like it “comes out of nowhere” if you’re only doing the execution work and not aware of the wider context.So what does stewardship work look like?So what is stewardship exactly? Sometimes it’s literally just rolling up your sleeves to do the work outlined in the strategy. Never underestimate how powerful a single reference piece of work can be - e.g. you want the editorial team to produce 1000s of pieces of content over the next 12 months - but if you create the gold standard piece of content it can get referenced again and again and become the inspiration for a whole team.So is the execution just plugging away in the trenches? Yes sometimes, but I think the most powerful stewardship work is around momentum - helping the organization or project accelerate their output. Some examples from my own work for things that look like stewardship:  Hiring &amp; building teams  Building workstreams, processes  Building dashboards and reporting templates  Adding partnerships and relationshipsIf you take this strategy &amp; stewardship approach - when the client comes to review the strategy at month 6 you’re still there working with the client and able to offer tangible and concrete insights into the work. How is the strategy evolving? Where should we adjust? What have we achieved?Using this approach the average retainer length for clients I work with is 20 months.I recall an important breakthrough for my own thinking - a client had hired another consultant to work on a project and afterwards I asked my client how the experience was and he said:  “It was fine - but he just gave advice. I like working with you because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves and do the work when it needs doing”This was a real lightbulb moment for me - up until that time I’d always worried about doing “menial” or “low-paid” work as a consultant but charging a strategy-based day-rate.But the thing I realized was that if you can provide momentum to an organization it doesn’t matter if you’re writing title tags in an SEO environment or putting together a board pitch: you should do the most valuable thing the business needs at that moment.The freedom of a consultant is that you can ignore job title / role / responsibility and be laser focused on moving the business towards key objectives and mixing your outputs from small to big as needed.So, don’t undervalue either part of your work - either the strategy or the stewardship. Remember that graph up above with the blue/green strategy/execution mix? I bill it all at the same day rate. Stewardship is just as valuable as strategy and there’s no reason to somehow charge less for the execution work.Only let clients in the strategy doorSo we’ve established that the combination of strategy &amp; stewardship is important - but there’s a crucial note to make:Clients that come to you only for implementation are going to be your worst clients.Wait what? Haven’t I been telling you to get your hands dirty? Yes, but…In his book the business of expertise in chapter 10 titled “Distinguishing expertise from implementation” David Baker uses the great analogy of a building with two connected rooms and two entrances, one for strategy and one for execution.The whole chapter is a delight and the punchline is: “only let clients in the strategy door”:The argument really boils down to:  Implementation work is hard work to sell - you get poor quality clients expecting a more easily commoditized output that drives your business towards lower margins  Not only that but implementation work is often more stressful and deadline-driven  So of course do both for clients but only let them in through the strategy door to ensure that you do better, higher value and higher margin work.You should really buy the book - it’s a fast read but has lots of pieces of wisdom6.Importantly - if you accept that you can do a lot of implementation work for clients but they should all start with strategy then your external positioning should be entirely focused around the strategy work to attract the right kinds of clients.Time &amp; MoneyHere’s a funny thing - when you read the accepted literature about pricing as an independent you’ll hear again and again that pricing based on time is a bad thing7. And, maybe they’re right - but I’ve had plenty of success charging on a loosely-coupled time-based approach (almost all of my work is scoped at a day rate, at least to begin with).I have a theory that this time-based approach to pricing is especially powerful as you move through a context-transition.Why? Well - as you go through this cycle of exposure to new contexts and working in new contexts you are by definition operating in new types of work and new types of environments and it’s hard to control the inputs and outputs.Put simply - as you ladder up into wider contexts for your work you don’t yet have enough experience to properly scope and price the work - not to mention you may be continually expanding your context not upwards but sideways into new types of workstreams.So I say - if you’re reading the commonly accepted wisdom about pricing and feeling like you’re doing it wrong by pricing based on time let me tell you that you’re totally fine and that strategic work by definition can be fuzzy and so scoping on project work can be dangerous.My own journey out of SEOLooking back at my career - this idea of doing work-in-context has determined the path I’ve taken from SEO manager to digital strategy to consulting work.The problem with SEO is that it’s inherently non-strategic. As an activity it’s increasingly commoditized and marginalized. Not that SEO-traffic is not important or that SEO is going away, but that the strategic activities you undertake to achieve business-level goals are usually not owned by SEO practitioners or agencies8.This wasn’t always true - there was a golden age of ~2008-2012 where an SEO agency could get directly in front of the CMO to work on digital strategy. Back in 2011 when I worked at Distilled it wasn’t uncommon to be working directly on digital strategy for fortune-500 brands, in a context model that looked something like this:But I could see the writing on the wall and could feel the shift as everyone else in digital “caught up” to the competencies and experience that the SEO industry had built up over the previous decade to the point where a more traditional SEO engagement now looks like this:As I felt this shift towards SEO being less strategic I needed to find ways to expand my context and work in different types of work more directly and explicitly.When I first started consulting in 2014, yes I worked mostly on SEO projects. But I was keenly aware of the wider context and pushed myself to ask questions and be curious - whether about the business model or the teams executing the work.Over time - by asking questions and pushing for more context I was able to start to get involved in several different wider context-circles and evolve the work I do9.How to learn to be more strategicTaking my personal SEO example above it’s hard to overstate the importance and value of being curious. Being curious about the industry you’re in and how it works, being curious about the clients you’re working for and being curious about the context of your own work is where this whole strategic independent path starts.Then, from there the path to strategic work looks something like this:  Ask questions and be curious (about the business, the industry, the people)  Explicitly ask to see surrounding context (e.g. as a writer, ask for the content strategy, as a marketer ask for the strategic roadmap)  Then, next time explicitly ask to be included in the creation of the surrounding context  Then, start offering and leading the projects to add the surrounding context  Repeat as you expand your contextHere’s a worked example from my own experience on “how to be more strategic” as I learned about brand positioning work for clients:  The first step was being curious about brand positioning - how does it work? What does it look like? I got exposed to a handful of these kinds of projects at Google and always asked questions  The second step is to keep your ear close to the ground and ask to be involved in a brand positioning workshop or project as it’s happening - just as an observer / participant.  The third step is to spot opportunities for where a brand positioning project would make sense and add value and source a partner to help with the work for a client - where I’m leading and owning the work output but working with a partner.  The fourth step is creating and running a brand positioning project on my own for a client (probably smaller to begin with while I gain confidence).This explicit evolution and experience in my own work probably took 3-4 years with the help of some friends but is exactly that ladder of context-awareness that enables you to get involved in strategic work.As you can see, this path to strategic work relies on gaining context from client work - but there’s another way to gain context - from your network.The adjacent-context benefit of independenceMost of this post focuses on the idea of context as gathered from your client and their business - but there’s another great source of context: peers.Co-dependence is really the right word for independence10. I’ve talked a lot about the power of the network - both as a tool for gathering leads for your business but also as an emotional support network.Frank Chimero wrote a wonderful essay I think about often titled the inferno of independence which is hard to boil down but looks at the nature of independent work - and articulates this shift from independence to co-dependence:  Listen: we only deserve what we can maintain and keep safe. A community is only as good as how well it takes care of all its members. There is no independence. There is only subservience or co-dependence. And I choose you. I choose community.Co-dependence and network building has plenty of other benefits11 but one key benefit of a diverse network is the adjacent-context. Some of the most helpful context you bring to your clients as an independent is the context they would otherwise not have access to or overlook.Adjacent context is thinking laterally about an industry, organization or problem - looking sideways for unusual or unexpected analogies or insights into expanding contexts that might not be obvious to you or your clients. You can only get this from hanging around a blend of interesting people who are also context-aware.So then, the strategic independent is someone who not only helps bridge context inside an organization but outside as well. This distance from a client’s organization is extremely valuable - and yet another reason not to undersell the value of context before and during an engagement. Someone able to connect the dots and do work-in-context but also expand the context into new directions.Will you join me on the path to being a strategic independent?Hopefully this long post was helpful - let’s recap the main points:  Work-in-context is more rewarding &amp; more effective for you and the client  It also allows you to charge for additional types of work! Hence making you better paid  But it also allows you to work with clients over a long time-horizon, extending the length of your client contracts (a compounding effect on revenue when combined with charging more)  As you begin to shift to strategic work - start to only let clients “in the strategy door” - you’ll get better clients this way  Learning how to be strategic is relatively straight forward (even if it takes a while) by constantly looking for additional context  And, as you work in fluid context-shifting client work don’t be afraid to charge based on time - despite what the received wisdom advises.  Finally as an independent remember that co-dependence with your network is actually the ideal state and you can gain context from peers just as much as you can from clientsI’m writing a book. Originally it was designed for “independent consultants” and… that’s still an audience. But I realized writing this post that the audience is wider - I’m writing not just for those doing “consulting” or even “strategy work” but also designers, writers, researchers, leaders who are doing strategic work, independently - the strategic independent.To peek the outline for the book head over here, and you can subscribe to my newsletter here to keep updated with the latest.I’d love to hear your experience with strategic work, independence and context. Leave me some comments below!–Thank you to the amazing people who reviewed early drafts of this piece, commented and generally made this piece better including: Adam Wiggins, Chris Butler, Rachel Joy Victor, John Doherty, Mark Pollard, Josh Braaten &amp; Brian Dell.–Update: April 26th 2019 I spent an hour discussing the ideas in this post with Jonathan Stark from the podcast Ditching Hourly and you can listen to that episode here.            I wrote a whole post called ways of seeing that explores ideas around sensemaking inside an organization &#8617;              This model seems… obvious? Except I’m always surprised at how often consultants and agencies fail to properly explore the wider contexts of the business either before starting work or during their engagement. &#8617;              I’m keen to hear more stories of different kinds of work where people have navigated this shift into wider contexts - email me! &#8617;              Page 40 of Recipes for Systemic Change by Helsinki Design Lab &#8617;              Page 15 of Legible Practices by Helsinki Design Lab &#8617;              There is however a shorter (older) version of this argument from David online here &#8617;              To be fair - many of the freelancer advice posts do caveat their advice saying day-rates are ok, but it’s usually a footnote and I think it’s easy to come away as a beginner only understanding that charging for time is bad. I know I did. &#8617;              Yes, there are exceptions to this of course but there’s a reason there’s no widely recognized c-suite SEO function. &#8617;              One consequence of this of course has been a difficulty in describing the work I do. For more thoughts on describing and defining my work see my post on media design. &#8617;              Frank was kind enough to point out that in-fact co-dependence is not the right word at all! The actual definition of the word is around enabling addiction. I didn’t know that! The correct word is interdependence and Frank Chimero has a more recent post all about this topic: back to the cave. Thanks Frank! &#8617;              I wrote about using a network to build a steady stream of high value leads in my post strange attraction &#8617;      "

  "date": "April 4, 2019",
  "content": "In this post I want to break down what I mean by “strategic independent” and why, whatever path you’re on and expertise you have, you can bring more value for yourself and your clients by thinking strategically.We’ll walk through:  What strategic work is - by looking at a variety of contexts you might work within and how to spot them.  Why strategic work is better - both for you and the client, offering more value to them and being more interesting for you.  How strategic work enables you to charge more - and keep clients retained for longer, a compounding effect on your ability to charge more.  How you can begin to think strategically - offering some real examples from my own career.Finally, how being independent offers more value for your clients by enabling you to gain adjacent context that your client might not be able to see and that we get this adjacent from our network - and therefore we should really think of being codependent with our network.Onwards…Strategic work is work-in-contextClient work can be frustrating:Ever had a project cancelled without notice?Ever had to go through endless revisions and feel like you’re not getting it?Ever had a project stall before it even started because you can’t agree on the exact deliverables?Ever had a piece of work never get implemented by a client?But frustration is a two player game - when you’re frustrated that work doesn’t make sense - the client is likely frustrated that your work doesn’t meet their objectives well enough.Context is the key.Even before I start working with a client in the very first meeting I always make sure I ask questions about business model, team structure, company priorities and more. These don’t always feel relevant to the specific request but help me better map out both the work I need to do and the stakeholders that need to see it.The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context1.Overlapping contextsSo when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts2.However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:Every project exists in multiple overlapping contexts - here’s some of the types of context to look for:  People (who are the stakeholders? what do they care about?)  Resources (what can they realistically do with your work?)  Brand (what is the position of the company?)  Marketing (audiences, channels, analytics)  Business model (revenue, profit)  Product (how does their product work, what is possible?)  The user (who is the user? What do they care about?)Your work likely overlaps at least partly with all of these ideas - but also depending on your specific work you might have different contexts and add more nuance.Strategic work is better workOnce you understand the concentric circles within which your work happens you’ll be able do work that’s more effective and useful for your clients.Two examples from my own work:  Example #1  I was working as a marketing advisor for a client and early in the engagement (partly because we were discussing me becoming the full-time CMO) I was invited to sit in on their quarterly board meeting. This experience was formative in better understanding the drivers and motivations of the business - by understanding who literally owned the business better. This context was crucial for proposing work and for ensuring that pitching that work to the board was smooth. The CEO gave me some of the necessary context but by attending that board meeting I got a vantage point that I didn’t realize existed previously.  Example #2  Last year I was working with a client to integrate an acquisition into the main business - in particular to ensure that one business function was working correctly. My north star and most of the language in the team was about revenue projections for the function. Makes sense. But, I discovered that actually the SVP’s OKR for the quarter was ensuring that the business unit was functioning smoothly. While revenue was obviously a thing that they cared about, the more important context was around process and communication around that process. Once I had this context everything became easier since I could be more closely aligned with the objectives of the business.Catastrophic Events &amp; Context CollapseThere’s a certain kind of experience that I want to describe where everything goes to shit. Certain events in business collapse the environment. For example - let’s take that context model for app design from earlier in the post. But let’s assume that the growth objectives are “in crisis” - this could be missing targets, people change, overspend, change in marketing strategy etcThese catastrophic events collapse the environment and cascade downwards. Every circle inside gets ignored, paused, cancelled, changed, redefined. These events are felt like system-shock for anyone operating in these lower circlesBut for those above the fire-line there are two things that are crucial:  Their objectives and priorities haven’t changed much, they’re still operating within the same context they were previously (although they may feel some turbulence)  They likely knew about the catastrophic event ahead of time. They may even have been responsible for causing the catastrophic event.We’ve likely all been personally inside a context as it collapses - either as a full time employee or a consultant / agency partner. It’s not fun.Riding these crashes is a skill that I think in theory you can get good at - learning how to sprint at a moments notice in a new direction and operate supernaturally fast in a crashing environment.But I think it’s way easier to instead always be searching upwards for more context awareness - i.e. working strategically. This helps you ride out those catastrophic events with more planning, awareness and foresight.Strategic work is better paidIn addition to being better work (for clients and for you) - strategic work is also better paid.As an independent - you’ll hear a lot of advice boil down to “charge more”. I’ve even said it myself! And it’s true - it’s the best advice you can get. Except… it’s kind of empty advice. I don’t think it provides much direction for how exactly you go about doing it.Translating executional work into strategic work is a framework that I think gives concrete ways of continually ratcheting up the price &amp; value of your work.The key idea is that at every layer of context there are new kinds of work - and by reaching for associated layers of context you can get involved in new kinds of work that are associated with and grounded in the thing you know but also a slight stretch.Not only can you charge more because the work is more useful, impactful and better but you can also charge for the associated parts of uncovering context - workshops, user research, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews etc.Let’s look at two examples:Scenario #1 - From Writing to Strategic WritingLet’s imagine you’re a writer - commissioned to write for a client’s branded content site.

In fact, do the opposite - charge more for it than your regular work.I see this often with more junior or less confident independents - you’re trying to close “the work” and so you throw in “the context” for free or as a sweetener.Don’t do this! Work-in-context is typically more expensive than regular work so don’t be afraid to price it separately and confidently.

Remember that graph up above with the blue/green strategy/execution mix? I bill it all at the same day rate. Stewardship is just as valuable as strategy and there’s no reason to somehow charge less for the execution work.Only let clients in the strategy doorSo we’ve established that the combination of strategy &amp; stewardship is important - but there’s a crucial note to make:Clients that come to you only for implementation are going to be your worst clients.Wait what? Haven’t I been telling you to get your hands dirty? Yes, but…In his book the business of expertise in chapter 10 titled “Distinguishing expertise from implementation” David Baker uses the great analogy of a building with two connected rooms and two entrances, one for strategy and one for execution.The whole chapter is a delight and the punchline is: “only let clients in the strategy door”:The argument really boils down to:  Implementation work is hard work to sell - you get poor quality clients expecting a more easily commoditized output that drives your business towards lower margins  Not only that but implementation work is often more stressful and deadline-driven  So of course do both for clients but only let them in through the strategy door to ensure that you do better, higher value and higher margin work.You should really buy the book - it’s a fast read but has lots of pieces of wisdom6.Importantly - if you accept that you can do a lot of implementation work for clients but they should all start with strategy then your external positioning should be entirely focused around the strategy work to attract the right kinds of clients.Time &amp; MoneyHere’s a funny thing - when you read the accepted literature about pricing as an independent you’ll hear again and again that pricing based on time is a bad thing7. And, maybe they’re right - but I’ve had plenty of success charging on a loosely-coupled time-based approach (almost all of my work is scoped at a day rate, at least to begin with).I have a theory that this time-based approach to pricing is especially powerful as you move through a context-transition.Why? Well - as you go through this cycle of exposure to new contexts and working in new contexts you are by definition operating in new types of work and new types of environments and it’s hard to control the inputs and outputs.Put simply - as you ladder up into wider contexts for your work you don’t yet have enough experience to properly scope and price the work - not to mention you may be continually expanding your context not upwards but sideways into new types of workstreams.So I say - if you’re reading the commonly accepted wisdom about pricing and feeling like you’re doing it wrong by pricing based on time let me tell you that you’re totally fine and that strategic work by definition can be fuzzy and so scoping on project work can be dangerous.My own journey out of SEOLooking back at my career - this idea of doing work-in-context has determined the path I’ve taken from SEO manager to digital strategy to consulting work.The problem with SEO is that it’s inherently non-strategic. As an activity it’s increasingly commoditized and marginalized. Not that SEO-traffic is not important or that SEO is going away, but that the strategic activities you undertake to achieve business-level goals are usually not owned by SEO practitioners or agencies8.This wasn’t always true - there was a golden age of ~2008-2012 where an SEO agency could get directly in front of the CMO to work on digital strategy. Back in 2011 when I worked at Distilled it wasn’t uncommon to be working directly on digital strategy for fortune-500 brands, in a context model that looked something like this:But I could see the writing on the wall and could feel the shift as everyone else in digital “caught up” to the competencies and experience that the SEO industry had built up over the previous decade to the point where a more traditional SEO engagement now looks like this:As I felt this shift towards SEO being less strategic I needed to find ways to expand my context and work in different types of work more directly and explicitly.When I first started consulting in 2014, yes I worked mostly on SEO projects. But I was keenly aware of the wider context and pushed myself to ask questions and be curious - whether about the business model or the teams executing the work.Over time - by asking questions and pushing for more context I was able to start to get involved in several different wider context-circles and evolve the work I do9.How to learn to be more strategicTaking my personal SEO example above it’s hard to overstate the importance and value of being curious. Being curious about the industry you’re in and how it works, being curious about the clients you’re working for and being curious about the context of your own work is where this whole strategic independent path starts.Then, from there the path to strategic work looks something like this:  Ask questions and be curious (about the business, the industry, the people)  Explicitly ask to see surrounding context (e.g. as a writer, ask for the content strategy, as a marketer ask for the strategic roadmap)  Then, next time explicitly ask to be included in the creation of the surrounding context  Then, start offering and leading the projects to add the surrounding context  Repeat as you expand your contextHere’s a worked example from my own experience on “how to be more strategic” as I learned about brand positioning work for clients:  The first step was being curious about brand positioning - how does it work? What does it look like? I got exposed to a handful of these kinds of projects at Google and always asked questions  The second step is to keep your ear close to the ground and ask to be involved in a brand positioning workshop or project as it’s happening - just as an observer / participant.  The third step is to spot opportunities for where a brand positioning project would make sense and add value and source a partner to help with the work for a client - where I’m leading and owning the work output but working with a partner.  The fourth step is creating and running a brand positioning project on my own for a client (probably smaller to begin with while I gain confidence).This explicit evolution and experience in my own work probably took 3-4 years with the help of some friends but is exactly that ladder of context-awareness that enables you to get involved in strategic work.As you can see, this path to strategic work relies on gaining context from client work - but there’s another way to gain context - from your network.The adjacent-context benefit of independenceMost of this post focuses on the idea of context as gathered from your client and their business - but there’s another great source of context: peers.Co-dependence is really the right word for independence10. I’ve talked a lot about the power of the network - both as a tool for gathering leads for your business but also as an emotional support network.Frank Chimero wrote a wonderful essay I think about often titled the inferno of independence which is hard to boil down but looks at the nature of independent work - and articulates this shift from independence to co-dependence:  Listen: we only deserve what we can maintain and keep safe. A community is only as good as how well it takes care of all its members. There is no independence. There is only subservience or co-dependence. And I choose you. I choose community.Co-dependence and network building has plenty of other benefits11 but one key benefit of a diverse network is the adjacent-context. Some of the most helpful context you bring to your clients as an independent is the context they would otherwise not have access to or overlook.Adjacent context is thinking laterally about an industry, organization or problem - looking sideways for unusual or unexpected analogies or insights into expanding contexts that might not be obvious to you or your clients. You can only get this from hanging around a blend of interesting people who are also context-aware.So then, the strategic independent is someone who not only helps bridge context inside an organization but outside as well. This distance from a client’s organization is extremely valuable - and yet another reason not to undersell the value of context before and during an engagement. Someone able to connect the dots and do work-in-context but also expand the context into new directions.Will you join me on the path to being a strategic independent?Hopefully this long post was helpful - let’s recap the main points:  Work-in-context is more rewarding &amp; more effective for you and the client  It also allows you to charge for additional types of work! Hence making you better paid  But it also allows you to work with clients over a long time-horizon, extending the length of your client contracts (a compounding effect on revenue when combined with charging more)  As you begin to shift to strategic work - start to only let clients “in the strategy door” - you’ll get better clients this way  Learning how to be strategic is relatively straight forward (even if it takes a while) by constantly looking for additional context  And, as you work in fluid context-shifting client work don’t be afraid to charge based on time - despite what the received wisdom advises.  Finally as an independent remember that co-dependence with your network is actually the ideal state and you can gain context from peers just as much as you can from clientsI’m writing a book. Originally it was designed for “independent consultants” and… that’s still an audience. But I realized writing this post that the audience is wider - I’m writing not just for those doing “consulting” or even “strategy work” but also designers, writers, researchers, leaders who are doing strategic work, independently - the strategic independent.To peek the outline for the book head over here, and you can subscribe to my newsletter here to keep updated with the latest.I’d love to hear your experience with strategic work, independence and context. Leave me some comments below!–Thank you to the amazing people who reviewed early drafts of this piece, commented and generally made this piece better including: Adam Wiggins, Chris Butler, Rachel Joy Victor, John Doherty, Mark Pollard, Josh Braaten &amp; Brian Dell.–Update: April 26th 2019 I spent an hour discussing the ideas in this post with Jonathan Stark from the podcast Ditching Hourly and you can listen to that episode here.            I wrote a whole post called ways of seeing that explores ideas around sensemaking inside an organization &#8617;              This model seems… obvious? Except I’m always surprised at how often consultants and agencies fail to properly explore the wider contexts of the business either before starting work or during their engagement. &#8617;              I’m keen to hear more stories of different kinds of work where people have navigated this shift into wider contexts - email me! &#8617;              Page 40 of Recipes for Systemic Change by Helsinki Design Lab &#8617;              Page 15 of Legible Practices by Helsinki Design Lab &#8617;              There is however a shorter (older) version of this argument from David online here &#8617;              To be fair - many of the freelancer advice posts do caveat their advice saying day-rates are ok, but it’s usually a footnote and I think it’s easy to come away as a beginner only understanding that charging for time is bad. I know I did. &#8617;              Yes, there are exceptions to this of course but there’s a reason there’s no widely recognized c-suite SEO function. &#8617;              One consequence of this of course has been a difficulty in describing the work I do. For more thoughts on describing and defining my work see my post on media design. &#8617;              Frank was kind enough to point out that in-fact co-dependence is not the right word at all! The actual definition of the word is around enabling addiction. I didn’t know that! The correct word is interdependence and Frank Chimero has a more recent post all about this topic: back to the cave. Thanks Frank! &#8617;              I wrote about using a network to build a steady stream of high value leads in my post strange attraction &#8617;      "

  "content": "The Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system - a strange attractor. It’s an elegant and beautiful mathematical object that looks a bit like this:Chaotic systems are often referenced in popular culture via the well-known butterfly effect: “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”.The general principle with chaotic systems is that no matter how carefully you try and control the inputs, the outputs will always surprise you.This… sounds a lot like the lead flow for my consulting business!After doing this for 4 years it’s still a surprise when and where leads come through - almost every time it’s “why did this happen? Why now?”.But it doesn’t mean the whole thing is random! There’s a distinction between random systems and chaotic systems. If you look at the Lorenz Attractor you can tell it’s not random - there’s a system at work - the key with chaotic systems is that you can’t control for individual outputs, but you can shape the system at large.In this post I’m going to break down my personal system and philosophy for generating leads for my consulting practice - embracing the chaos of generating warm leads from real humans. It all boils down to controlling for system-level outputs not individual outcomes by focusing on the following:  Focus on networks over networking  Articulate your work  Publish to be presentI’ll explain, but first:A quick primer on my workIt’s worth explaining the kind of work I do, with some important caveats. I do strategic consulting work as an independent. Often I’m embedded within a client’s organization and often for long periods of time1 (for example - think two days a week in the office for 18 months working across a variety of projects).This means that - for me - I’m primarily concerned with warm leads for long term strategic work.It’s important for leads to be warm - because it’s hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)It’s important for leads to be primed for long term strategic work - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you (this helps you get paid well and helps you have a bigger impact) and you want retained work that lasts2 (this helps you smooth revenue gaps and gain some predictability).This means that for me - I’m definitely optimizing for quality over quantity. 5-10 leads a year can keep me full up. And I think for many independents this will be and should be the case - optimizing for quantity will create a very different environment.The varieties of styles and approaches to independent work will surprise you so I won’t claim to say this is the only way to do things but it works for me so maybe you’ll learn something to add to your own approach.All my friends are strange attractorsThe Lorenz System is classified as a strange attractor - as mentioned above it’s a chaotic system - which means that no matter how closely you observe the initial conditions you will always be surprised by the output.Aside from being beautiful (and the loops looking the wings of a butterfly if you squint!) I find this visualization oddly satisfying and descriptive of two people’s lives. Their orbits entwined - strangely.I imagine every relationship as some kind of Lorenz strange loop - with us at times orbiting closely and at times drifting apart. This notion of friendship with vast unknowable orbits.But people - humans - contacts - friends - is where I get all of my business from. All of the leads for my consulting business come from a small number of people. In fact, running the numbers 60% of my all-time consulting revenue can be traced to just four people:What does this feel like in practice?A butterfly fluttersSomewhere in London in 2010(?) I met two gentlemen at a networking dinner. If I’m honest I don’t recall this in any way shape or form. But someone I worked with in London around the same time who is now a close friend popped into my inbox in 2016 to make a strange attraction intro…This lead turned into one of the biggest single sources of consulting revenue since I’ve been out on my own.Another one:This turned into a super-useful project for me that snowballed into the last year working in media. Funny how those things go.Sometimes though it’s people you don’t know very well. This is someone who I interviewed for a senior role at a previous job - who then turned the tables and put me forward for a consulting gig:Ok - so… Humans power this whole warm-leads business.But of all the humans I know - why these ones? Is it random? How can we motivate people to send us work? There’s two things you can do - build a network and talk to them.Ways to build a network of strange attractorsIt’s obvious - but often overlooked - that to build a flow of warm referrals you need to have a network of folks who know you, and know what projects you’re a good fit for. So how do you build a larger network? Some approaches:Public GroupsMy friend Carly Ayres (who just sunsetted her studio - RIP Hawraf) hosts a meetup series called 100s under 100. It’s a friends of friends kind of thing but open to a large group (these meetups range from a small group to 100s).My friend Mark Pollard runs Sweathead a public FB group for strategists. He’s a community-building natural and he actively cultivates community, engagement and audience - for example he has a Sweathead podcast that interviews many people from the community itself.These events are a great platform to build awareness and large groups of loose networks as well as gain authority by being the public figure-head of a large group.Private GroupsI know a variety of private invite-only groups - most of these happen on Slack these days. One in particular that is especially high signal-to-noise is the Sunday Dinners slack group. This group is small, has less virtue signaling - since it’s private - but can be a wonderful way to build a more intimate group of close ties. These private groups are typically &lt;150 members. Anything above that and I think you start to lose the intimate nature and it turns into something more akin to a public group.One advantage of these private groups is the ability to discuss work-in-progress and the more raw side of client / project challenges and success. This can help bridge a true picture of what work looks like for you which sets you up for success when cultivating warm intros.Small GatheringsOver the past two years I’ve been hosting invite-only dinner events. They usually run 10-15 people and, honestly, are a weird mix of my actual friends, people I know doing interesting things and people who I know will get value from the weird mix I put together. There’s no structure to these events but they form bonds and connections between many different people in my networks.Across all three of these approaches - the key is to be the anchor of the network. By being the anchor you gain an order of magnitude more recognition and exposure than merely attending someone else’s event or being a member in someone else’s slack. Being the anchor of a group of 10 is better than being a member of a group of 100 (though of course they’re not mutually exclusive!).Strange communication - aka talking to your networkIt’s not enough to just have a network though. You need to talk to them for two key reasons:Firstly - the key to getting good leads is helping your network understand what opportunities you might be a good fit for. You have to help your network understand what you do and how you think. This is so much more than just “marketing work” - you need to really get granular. If you look back at the human warm leads above they all had a specific point of entry - for example “SEO leader with a background in content and commerce”. You need to talk and share with your network so that they can find these specific reference points for a warm intro.Secondly - being top of mind is, remarkably, an effective tactic. Humans are wired for recency so if someone saw a post or email of yours recently they’ll be much more likely to put you forward for work. Especially the further out you go in the fringes of your network you need to be seen to be remembered.If you look at the above examples - 100 under 100, Sweathead, Sunday Dinners, my own dinner series - every single one is a great platform that is taken advantage of by the owners to educate and talk about the work they do beyond just sharing client names. This creates a great surface area to cultivate the right kinds of work from your network.So, listen, I’m gonna sound like a broken record, but the blog+newsletter combo is a great answer. For independents you have to carve out your own little space to write and distribute your ideas. And don’t worry about chasing scale. From my piece small b blogging:  small b blogging. It’s a virtuous cycle of making interesting connections while also being a way to clarify and strengthen my own ideas. I’m not reaching a big audience by any measure but the direct impact and benefit is material.  Small b blogging is learning to write and think with the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most “content marketing”.On butterflies and sea-gullsRemember that chaos-theory-butterfly anecdote?  “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”Well, it was originally a quote about sea-gulls:  “One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a sea gull’s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.”The poor ugly un-poetic seagull3.What’s the story here? The lesson is that language is a virus. Design your case studies to be pithy - talk about your work in small fragments that can be repeated in oral culture:  “Commerce and content”  “Hired a team of 10”  “Interim CMO”These short phrases can sum up and signal so much to the right person at the right time - and you can use many of them at once. This is an ongoing project of listening to how people make intros for you - and noting the little phrases they use. How are people understanding and describing your work in the two-line email?Reducing ambiguity using a capabilities deckThere’s a problem with warm leads though - you get caught up in email FW: FW: intros and nebulous-sounding intros and requests. This is a two-sided problem - it’s hard for you to know which ones are worth your time, and it’s hard for the other party to know if you’re a good fit for their needs.I’ve found that having a “capabilities deck” - i.e. a PDF that summarizes the work you do and who do it for - is useful and helpful in closing the right kinds of work.For example - see this email exchange:In this example - a warm intro has become a luke-warm intro. I’ve never met or talked to person A who’s intro-ing me to person B. This is often the kind of thing that goes no-where. So I throw out a “pleasure to meet you, here’s a PDF, let me know if there’s a fit?”.That email turned into a big project, and it was the second time I’d ever used a PDF attachment to explain my work.The very first time I used a capabilities deck attachment? This one:This email - in March - closed 6 months later. I attached my capabilities deck as a “hey, also” but it worked.When you first start out as a consultant - I’m not entirely sure a capabilities deck is the right thing to spend time and energy on. You’ll likely not have enough stuff to put in it and you’ll spin your wheels with the language you use. But once you have completed a few projects and are starting to generate enough of these warm leads I think it can be a useful tool to have.Looking for an example? Check out Mark Pollard’s for a good public example.There’s much more to be written about how to put one of these together4 but for now I think aim to be concise and precise. Aim for 10 slides. Be specific about what you do.The weird many-colored butterflyI want to take a moment to talk about “weird work”. Many independents feel trapped in a box - unable to “break out” into work that they either want to do or feel interested in. I asked Venkatesh Rao how to find more alternative work out of your comfort zone and he said this (bolding mine):  I think you just have to do whatever most energizes you and produces a lot of output, and let the work/opportunities find you. I have never gotten an enjoyable weird gig out of going fishing myself. You choose boring, normal work, but interesting, weird work chooses you.  Quantity has a quality all its own as Lenin said. The sheer volume of your work is what works as a signal of weirdness, because anyone can be do a one-off weird thing, but only volume can signal a consistently weird production sensibility that will inspire people betting on you. The energy evident in a body of work is the most honest signal about it that makes people trust you to do things for them.This quote is very true for weird work - but applies to any kind of new direction you want to take. Only volume can signal a specific sensibility that makes people trust you to do things for them.So if you want more work in a specific vein - write about it! Talk about it! Consistent output will get you there - though of course the flip side of this is that you have to recognize that it can take time to build up this output so likely won’t happen quickly.Podcasts &amp; conferences - oral traditions of storytellingBecause we’re focusing on generating warm leads from real humans - it’s not just about what you say but also how you say it. The oral tradition is important. Conferences and podcasts are two accessible platforms for telling human - oral - stories.As an independent it can be hard to break into the conference and podcast circuit. Typically you are lacking the recognized labels and power that comes with a full time job to be considered by organizers and hosts.There’s a whole blog post brewing in me about the specific challenges of getting invited to speak as an independent - the crux of it I think boils down to making “things with labels”. Books, art projects, websites, communities, etc are all great ways to build some semblance of “trust totems” that an organizer or host can recognize and use to invite you into the spotlight.Nothing allows you to forge human connections at scale quite like the spoken word. So you should leap at these opportunities - tell you story and talk about the work (at least a little).On catching butterfliesCatching butterflies is a fine hobby5. A relaxing past-time. But the idea of dissecting, analyzing and cataloging butterflies tells you nothing of the storms in Tokyo that these little wings once caused.Trying to build a CRM and lead-management tool for a solo independent business that lives on 5-10 leads a year feels a lot like catching butterflies. If you’re looking for a hobby and like spending hours alone with dead insects then… fine? But otherwise - I’d encourage you to focus your time and energies on building networks over tracking each lead minutely.In closingRemember - all of this is my perspective, and there’s as many different ways of running a consulting business as there are varieties of butterflies. The key points are:  Warm leads power well-paid strategic work  Cultivating warm leads requires working with, and understanding humans  It’s hard to predict individual outcomes but in aggregate we can control the system in two ways:          Anchor our own networks      Communicate regularly and explain the work        Listen to how people make intros for key ways to describe the work  If you find yourself overwhelmed with ambiguous lukewarm leads consider a capabilities deck  Embrace the oral platforms (conferences, podcasts) to create connections  Finally, don’t belabor any kind of CRM unless you enjoy butterfly-collecting as a hobbyWhat’s your experience building networks and leads for your consulting business?–Image credits: Larry Bradley, Dan Quinn, Life archives            For a visual representation of my work see my post four years on the road  &#8617;              For more on how focus on retained strategy work see my post strategy and stewardship &#8617;              More often these days Texas gets replaced by Tokyo which also tells you about globalization and the romantic brand of Tokyo vs Texas &#8617;              I started collecting examples and advice for making a capabilities deck over on my wiki page here &#8617;              Did you know Vladamir Nabakov, author of Lolita, was an avid butterfly collector and created some beautiful sketches? &#8617;      "

And I think for many independents this will be and should be the case - optimizing for quantity will create a very different environment.The varieties of styles and approaches to independent work will surprise you so I won’t claim to say this is the only way to do things but it works for me so maybe you’ll learn something to add to your own approach.All my friends are strange attractorsThe Lorenz System is classified as a strange attractor - as mentioned above it’s a chaotic system - which means that no matter how closely you observe the initial conditions you will always be surprised by the output.Aside from being beautiful (and the loops looking the wings of a butterfly if you squint!) I find this visualization oddly satisfying and descriptive of two people’s lives. Their orbits entwined - strangely.I imagine every relationship as some kind of Lorenz strange loop - with us at times orbiting closely and at times drifting apart. This notion of friendship with vast unknowable orbits.But people - humans - contacts - friends - is where I get all of my business from. All of the leads for my consulting business come from a small number of people. In fact, running the numbers 60% of my all-time consulting revenue can be traced to just four people:What does this feel like in practice?A butterfly fluttersSomewhere in London in 2010(?) I met two gentlemen at a networking dinner. If I’m honest I don’t recall this in any way shape or form. But someone I worked with in London around the same time who is now a close friend popped into my inbox in 2016 to make a strange attraction intro…This lead turned into one of the biggest single sources of consulting revenue since I’ve been out on my own.Another one:This turned into a super-useful project for me that snowballed into the last year working in media. Funny how those things go.Sometimes though it’s people you don’t know very well. This is someone who I interviewed for a senior role at a previous job - who then turned the tables and put me forward for a consulting gig:Ok - so… Humans power this whole warm-leads business.But of all the humans I know - why these ones? Is it random? How can we motivate people to send us work? There’s two things you can do - build a network and talk to them.Ways to build a network of strange attractorsIt’s obvious - but often overlooked - that to build a flow of warm referrals you need to have a network of folks who know you, and know what projects you’re a good fit for. So how do you build a larger network? Some approaches:Public GroupsMy friend Carly Ayres (who just sunsetted her studio - RIP Hawraf) hosts a meetup series called 100s under 100. It’s a friends of friends kind of thing but open to a large group (these meetups range from a small group to 100s).My friend Mark Pollard runs Sweathead a public FB group for strategists. He’s a community-building natural and he actively cultivates community, engagement and audience - for example he has a Sweathead podcast that interviews many people from the community itself.These events are a great platform to build awareness and large groups of loose networks as well as gain authority by being the public figure-head of a large group.Private GroupsI know a variety of private invite-only groups - most of these happen on Slack these days. One in particular that is especially high signal-to-noise is the Sunday Dinners slack group. This group is small, has less virtue signaling - since it’s private - but can be a wonderful way to build a more intimate group of close ties. These private groups are typically &lt;150 members. Anything above that and I think you start to lose the intimate nature and it turns into something more akin to a public group.One advantage of these private groups is the ability to discuss work-in-progress and the more raw side of client / project challenges and success. This can help bridge a true picture of what work looks like for you which sets you up for success when cultivating warm intros.Small GatheringsOver the past two years I’ve been hosting invite-only dinner events. They usually run 10-15 people and, honestly, are a weird mix of my actual friends, people I know doing interesting things and people who I know will get value from the weird mix I put together. There’s no structure to these events but they form bonds and connections between many different people in my networks.Across all three of these approaches - the key is to be the anchor of the network. By being the anchor you gain an order of magnitude more recognition and exposure than merely attending someone else’s event or being a member in someone else’s slack. Being the anchor of a group of 10 is better than being a member of a group of 100 (though of course they’re not mutually exclusive!).Strange communication - aka talking to your networkIt’s not enough to just have a network though. You need to talk to them for two key reasons:Firstly - the key to getting good leads is helping your network understand what opportunities you might be a good fit for. You have to help your network understand what you do and how you think. This is so much more than just “marketing work” - you need to really get granular. If you look back at the human warm leads above they all had a specific point of entry - for example “SEO leader with a background in content and commerce”. You need to talk and share with your network so that they can find these specific reference points for a warm intro.Secondly - being top of mind is, remarkably, an effective tactic. Humans are wired for recency so if someone saw a post or email of yours recently they’ll be much more likely to put you forward for work. Especially the further out you go in the fringes of your network you need to be seen to be remembered.If you look at the above examples - 100 under 100, Sweathead, Sunday Dinners, my own dinner series - every single one is a great platform that is taken advantage of by the owners to educate and talk about the work they do beyond just sharing client names. This creates a great surface area to cultivate the right kinds of work from your network.So, listen, I’m gonna sound like a broken record, but the blog+newsletter combo is a great answer. For independents you have to carve out your own little space to write and distribute your ideas. And don’t worry about chasing scale. From my piece small b blogging:  small b blogging. It’s a virtuous cycle of making interesting connections while also being a way to clarify and strengthen my own ideas. I’m not reaching a big audience by any measure but the direct impact and benefit is material.  Small b blogging is learning to write and think with the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most “content marketing”.On butterflies and sea-gullsRemember that chaos-theory-butterfly anecdote?  “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”Well, it was originally a quote about sea-gulls:  “One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a sea gull’s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.”The poor ugly un-poetic seagull3.What’s the story here? The lesson is that language is a virus. Design your case studies to be pithy - talk about your work in small fragments that can be repeated in oral culture:  “Commerce and content”  “Hired a team of 10”  “Interim CMO”These short phrases can sum up and signal so much to the right person at the right time - and you can use many of them at once. This is an ongoing project of listening to how people make intros for you - and noting the little phrases they use. How are people understanding and describing your work in the two-line email?Reducing ambiguity using a capabilities deckThere’s a problem with warm leads though - you get caught up in email FW: FW: intros and nebulous-sounding intros and requests. This is a two-sided problem - it’s hard for you to know which ones are worth your time, and it’s hard for the other party to know if you’re a good fit for their needs.I’ve found that having a “capabilities deck” - i.e. a PDF that summarizes the work you do and who do it for - is useful and helpful in closing the right kinds of work.For example - see this email exchange:In this example - a warm intro has become a luke-warm intro. I’ve never met or talked to person A who’s intro-ing me to person B. This is often the kind of thing that goes no-where. So I throw out a “pleasure to meet you, here’s a PDF, let me know if there’s a fit?”.That email turned into a big project, and it was the second time I’d ever used a PDF attachment to explain my work.The very first time I used a capabilities deck attachment? This one:This email - in March - closed 6 months later. I attached my capabilities deck as a “hey, also” but it worked.When you first start out as a consultant - I’m not entirely sure a capabilities deck is the right thing to spend time and energy on. You’ll likely not have enough stuff to put in it and you’ll spin your wheels with the language you use. But once you have completed a few projects and are starting to generate enough of these warm leads I think it can be a useful tool to have.Looking for an example? Check out Mark Pollard’s for a good public example.There’s much more to be written about how to put one of these together4 but for now I think aim to be concise and precise. Aim for 10 slides. Be specific about what you do.The weird many-colored butterflyI want to take a moment to talk about “weird work”. Many independents feel trapped in a box - unable to “break out” into work that they either want to do or feel interested in. I asked Venkatesh Rao how to find more alternative work out of your comfort zone and he said this (bolding mine):  I think you just have to do whatever most energizes you and produces a lot of output, and let the work/opportunities find you. I have never gotten an enjoyable weird gig out of going fishing myself. You choose boring, normal work, but interesting, weird work chooses you.  Quantity has a quality all its own as Lenin said. The sheer volume of your work is what works as a signal of weirdness, because anyone can be do a one-off weird thing, but only volume can signal a consistently weird production sensibility that will inspire people betting on you. The energy evident in a body of work is the most honest signal about it that makes people trust you to do things for them.This quote is very true for weird work - but applies to any kind of new direction you want to take. Only volume can signal a specific sensibility that makes people trust you to do things for them.So if you want more work in a specific vein - write about it! Talk about it! Consistent output will get you there - though of course the flip side of this is that you have to recognize that it can take time to build up this output so likely won’t happen quickly.Podcasts &amp; conferences - oral traditions of storytellingBecause we’re focusing on generating warm leads from real humans - it’s not just about what you say but also how you say it. The oral tradition is important. Conferences and podcasts are two accessible platforms for telling human - oral - stories.As an independent it can be hard to break into the conference and podcast circuit. Typically you are lacking the recognized labels and power that comes with a full time job to be considered by organizers and hosts.There’s a whole blog post brewing in me about the specific challenges of getting invited to speak as an independent - the crux of it I think boils down to making “things with labels”. Books, art projects, websites, communities, etc are all great ways to build some semblance of “trust totems” that an organizer or host can recognize and use to invite you into the spotlight.Nothing allows you to forge human connections at scale quite like the spoken word. So you should leap at these opportunities - tell you story and talk about the work (at least a little).On catching butterfliesCatching butterflies is a fine hobby5. A relaxing past-time. But the idea of dissecting, analyzing and cataloging butterflies tells you nothing of the storms in Tokyo that these little wings once caused.Trying to build a CRM and lead-management tool for a solo independent business that lives on 5-10 leads a year feels a lot like catching butterflies. If you’re looking for a hobby and like spending hours alone with dead insects then… fine? But otherwise - I’d encourage you to focus your time and energies on building networks over tracking each lead minutely.In closingRemember - all of this is my perspective, and there’s as many different ways of running a consulting business as there are varieties of butterflies. The key points are:  Warm leads power well-paid strategic work  Cultivating warm leads requires working with, and understanding humans  It’s hard to predict individual outcomes but in aggregate we can control the system in two ways:          Anchor our own networks      Communicate regularly and explain the work        Listen to how people make intros for key ways to describe the work  If you find yourself overwhelmed with ambiguous lukewarm leads consider a capabilities deck  Embrace the oral platforms (conferences, podcasts) to create connections  Finally, don’t belabor any kind of CRM unless you enjoy butterfly-collecting as a hobbyWhat’s your experience building networks and leads for your consulting business?–Image credits: Larry Bradley, Dan Quinn, Life archives            For a visual representation of my work see my post four years on the road  &#8617;              For more on how focus on retained strategy work see my post strategy and stewardship &#8617;              More often these days Texas gets replaced by Tokyo which also tells you about globalization and the romantic brand of Tokyo vs Texas &#8617;              I started collecting examples and advice for making a capabilities deck over on my wiki page here &#8617;              Did you know Vladamir Nabakov, author of Lolita, was an avid butterfly collector and created some beautiful sketches? &#8617;      "

  "content": "Co-authored by Tom Critchlow &amp; Toby Shorin. Toby’s edits are marked in purple.The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of managing your own labels. Inventing terms to describe who you are and what you do.This can feel like “soft” work - somehow less important than the “real” work of finding clients, setting up an LLC, etc. But the truth is that the labels you use to describe yourself are crucial to your self-identity in the world of independent work.And, counter-intuitively, creating labels is hard not because they have to work for others (clients, friends etc) but because the label has to work for you.Of course labels are external by design - they play a role in how you position and market yourself. But the struggle for labels happens internally - the real audience is the person looking back at you in the mirror. A label you can feel comfortable and confident with.Do I justify this label?Am I really good enough to be X?Who am I to charge clients for Y?What am I doing?What do I want to be?These days I call myself a consultant. But I’ve been doing this 4.5 years and it’s only recently that I feel comfortable really embracing that label. In this post I’m going to walk through how labels can help you charge more, where the angst comes from and how to deal with “the question” as an independent…Tend to your labels as you growWhen you’re fully employed, you get a steady paycheck but you also get a stable, recognized label. You say “I’m a product manager at IBM” (for example).Toby Shorin: This label is affirmed in speech and action by your colleagues, who interact with you through and on the terms of your role. You fit into your employer’s org chart, a map of possible role-labels which exist as constituent pieces within the whole of the business entity. “Imposter syndrome,” then, is simply the neurotic inability to accept others’ recognition and confirmation of your given label.But when you step out on your own you suddenly remove the construct that provides this plug-and-play identity and are left to make one up on your own. When you first leap into this unknown it’s often easy to describe who you are - you’re defined by what you just left.“I just quit Google to head out on my own.”“Ex-McKinsey Partner.”“Work &amp; Co Alumni.”This framing is easy and safe - and it’s totally ok to lean on this. While you will feel the urge to create new labels and framing for yourself it’s ok for this process to take some time and in the interim you can just tell your story.As the days turn into weeks and months though, new language will emerge.When I headed out on my own into the world of independent work I used the word “consulting” to describe the kind of client work I was doing, largely because I used the term ‘consulting’ when I was doing client work at the agency Distilled pre-Google.” But it didn’t feel right to call myself a “consultant” yet.If you’ve done client work before, it might feel instinctive to use whatever word you used then.  But now that you’re out on your own, and you’ll likely wrestle with the kind of language you feel is “true” or “earned”:Self-employed? Sure. (though that implies that I’m paying the bills?)Freelancer? Probably. (though that implies a short term version of full-time work?)As you head into the unknown of independent work you should worry less about this label - no one will care about it as much as you do - and it’s less an absolute definition of who you are and more a process of growing into the person you want to be.The internal angst of labelsAs you journey through the independent adventure you’ll have to invent your own labels. Maybe many labels! As you try them out you’ll likely wrestle with them and lose sleep over them (I know I did!).Again - labels have the dual property of being external and internal. They’re external in the sense that you’ll use them on your website1, your twitter bio and in conversation. But from my own experience this external nature of labels takes a backseat to the inner hand-wringing and discomfort that comes with trying to describe who you are and what you do.This inner angst of labels comes in three ways:Firstly, you imagine that this label matters externally. Positioning is often discussed in the context of “market positioning” or “positioning statement” - something that helps potential clients find and engage with you. That’s true, to a degree. But for many independents the label is less important externally than it is internally. Clients tend to look for evidence, content, associations and perspective that aligns with theirs. They tend to be indifferent to the specifics of the label you use (e.g. a consultant or a freelancer).Secondly, you imagine that you have to earn your label. That somehow others have the power to grant you use of a label. No one has that power, but a lot is riding on the shared belief that institutions can and do control this power. Part of being untethered and free-floating independent is existing outside of the gatekeeper infrastructure.TS: In contemporary society, we are rarely given the opportunity to define for ourself who we are. Schooling and employment are at their essence a series of “gates,” an exercise in conditional label-granting. As youth we are told, with terrorizing frequency, that we cannot do things without first obtaining a title, that we are valueless without some authority giving it to us. As a result of this training, suddenly having the opportunity to define and own one’s own label can be piercingly uncomfortable. We ask “who am I?”—but there is nobody there to answer us. Faced with this profound discomfort of unboundedness, we instinctively seek limits and obstacles. We project gatekeepers in front of us, to protect us from responsibility for our own identities.Thirdly, you have to reconcile your personal and professional identities. Choose a label too whimsical and you’ll worry that people won’t take you seriously, but choose a label too corporate or commercial and people will think you’re too boring. Striking a balance here is necessary and will vary wildly from industry to industry. Remember you can have multiple labels just like you have a multi-faceted identity2.TS: Just as becoming independent challenges the distinction between work time and personal time, it also challenges the distinction between your professional and personal self-perception. When are you acting as a “consultant” or “freelancer,” and when are you acting as “father” or “partner?” Lines between networking and making friends blur, and it becomes necessary to get comfortable with these overlapping labels.Psychic Armor for the Arena of CapitalismMaking labels is not just aspirational and emotional - there’s one key functional benefit: helping you charge more money for your work.I’ll tell you a secret: every time I send an invoice to a client I want to throw up3.If you Google around everyone will tell you to “raise your rates” or “charge more”. They’re right. But it’s also not so easy!Having the self-confidence and authority to command premium rates is intrinsically linked to a sense of self-worth and identity. And by extension - any doubt or wavering of self-confidence causes psychic trauma / cognitive dissonance when you attempt to attach dollars to your personal identityHow can you solve this? Through a deliberately professional label.Once you find a label that you are not terrified of then you can use that label as psychic armor to create emotional protection from the traumas of capitalism.One has a vague sense of what rate feels too low, but almost anything above that seems too high.You need a construct to do the charging for you.This quote illustrates it really well (bolding mine):  At that point, I was charging $25-30 an hour and loved what I was doing, but soon realized that in my work, I’d often create systems that erased the job I was initially hired to do. That’s when I realized I could start calling myself a consultant. Owning the title “consultant” enabled a psychological shift in the way I thought about the work I was doing. This shift led me to increase my rate again, and eventually to articulate the skills I could offer new clients in the form of a program, complete with a business name, website, and set of rates. Before I articulated this “business offering” in a clear program, my annual revenue was around $40k. After making it clear exactly what I could offer potential clients, and by shifting my offerings based on what I saw clients finding most useful, my revenue jumped to $60k, then $85k, and last year (2018) it was $110k. (Remember, these numbers are revenue, not net profit.)This is from the excellent piece On what it takes to sustain a creative life financially by Sarah Schulweis.This quote resonates with me because I went through the exact same journey - struggling to charge well for my time when I viewed myself as a freelancer or self-employed. Once I started using the word consultant (and started to actually believe it!) I felt more comfortable charging more for my work.For me personally I think not in terms of Tom Critchlow sending you this invoice, but in terms of my consulting business sending you this invoice4.How do you develop your own capitalist construct? It will vary from industry to industry. For me, it’s as simple as leaning on the word “consultant”. For others, creating a “studio” branding might be the construct needed to charge well.The worst thing to do is to let your personal identity be the thing that does the billing (regardless of whether it comes from “your name LLC” or not, don’t let your personal identity be the construct you use)5.TS: Note that even within our professional construct, different situations call for different behaviors. It can be helpful to think of each of these as a micro-label: the me who deals with difficult client stakeholders; the me who can ask to raise my rates; the me who is good at networking; the me who can give a great sales pitch.“The Question” &amp; the identity crisisSooner or later when you’re independent a client will offer you a full time role.Do you want to join the team full time?I’ve been faced with this question no fewer than 5 times in my consulting life and every single time it throws me for an emotional rollercoaster.Talking to others I get the same sense - that even when it’s a company, a role or a salary that is unattractive full-time your mind can’t stop thinking about taking the role6.The reason this question is able to throw you for a loop is because it challenges your self-made identity. It directly confronts and questions your ability to stand behind the labels you’ve chosen - by placing them in contrast to the “authoritative” and “well-understood” and “recognizable” label that they’re offering you.TS: The company has pierced directly through the psychic armour of your professional construct, and made a claim on your identity—they are offering a direct challenge to your label structure, your perception of who you are.There’s two ways to protect yourself from this emotional rollercoaster.Firstly, Don’t let their label over-rule your label. You have a seat at the table - and they can’t take that away from you.TS: The client is offering to change its relationship with you, but don’t forget they still perceive you as a consultant to them. What you have is valuable enough for them to pay the premium rate of an independent consultant. Except for in senior executive roles, joining full time can in fact devalue your work as it becomes more accessible.Secondly, remember that you can retain your identity as a consultant and take a full-time role. Offer to take the role but still bill through your LLC. While this option isn’t exactly viable for many situations it can help your perspective by thinking through this lens.I remember a few years ago when my consulting work slowed down slightly and I took a job interview via a friend. I ended up with a job offer to become Creative Director7 at a digital innovation studio. Despite  the fact that the salary they offered me was half what I earned that year, I almost took the job! I think it would have been a huge mistake but wow do those identity questions make you lose some sleep.Poetry over PowerMany times titles and labels are a show of power. Some display of strength over others. I have this label is the same as saying I have this power.I’d encourage you to think of poetry instead of power. No one has claims on anyone else and part of the freedom of being independent is breaking free from some of those traditional power structures.Use language and labels as a texture to provide as much psychological safety and identity as you need. If you feel less secure - choose labels that are well-understood. If you need to feel like an outsider - choose labels that are unique and unusual8. If you want to be weird, be weird. You can hold a poetry over your own identity this way. Bewitching yourself is completely allowed.From the book Finite &amp; Infinite Games:  “Therefore, poets do not ‘fit’ into society, not because a place is denied them but because they do not take their ‘places’ seriously. They openly see its roles as theatrical, its styles as poses, its clothing costumes, its rules conventional, its crises arranged, its conflicts performed and its metaphysics ideological.”So play with labels, understand their power not over others but over ourselves. Understand their ability to provide an inner confidence and provide shelter in the capitalist storm.            As an independent - putting your website together is like a rite of passage. Everyone struggles with it and you will always have a vague unease with what your personal site says about yourself. &#8617;              As Walt Whitman said in Song of Myself ‘I am large, I contain multitudes!’ &#8617;              File this one under ‘things people don’t tell you when you go independent’ as well &#8617;              I wrestled with a professional identity a while back in this post Why I’ve decided not to launch a brand for my consulting work. While I decided not to create a website and ‘branding’ for this agency called Yes, and… I did end up forming an LLC and use that construct on all my invoices. &#8617;              Interestingly, studies have shown that trading your time for money leads to taking less pleasure in leisure activity. I think a professional label and construct can help alleviate this problem slightly. Also a good reminder to not charge hourly! Day rates are better. &#8617;              To be clear not all full-time roles are bad! And there are legitimate reasons you might want or need to take the role (security, salary, health insurance etc. &#8617;              Notice how I’m still using the label here! I’m using the story and their perceived authority to help position myself as part Creative Director. This emotional journey never ends…. &#8617;              A few labels I love: Alphabet Artist, Media Inventor!

Positioning is often discussed in the context of “market positioning” or “positioning statement” - something that helps potential clients find and engage with you. That’s true, to a degree. But for many independents the label is less important externally than it is internally. Clients tend to look for evidence, content, associations and perspective that aligns with theirs. They tend to be indifferent to the specifics of the label you use (e.g. a consultant or a freelancer).Secondly, you imagine that you have to earn your label. That somehow others have the power to grant you use of a label. No one has that power, but a lot is riding on the shared belief that institutions can and do control this power. Part of being untethered and free-floating independent is existing outside of the gatekeeper infrastructure.TS: In contemporary society, we are rarely given the opportunity to define for ourself who we are. Schooling and employment are at their essence a series of “gates,” an exercise in conditional label-granting. As youth we are told, with terrorizing frequency, that we cannot do things without first obtaining a title, that we are valueless without some authority giving it to us. As a result of this training, suddenly having the opportunity to define and own one’s own label can be piercingly uncomfortable. We ask “who am I?”—but there is nobody there to answer us. Faced with this profound discomfort of unboundedness, we instinctively seek limits and obstacles. We project gatekeepers in front of us, to protect us from responsibility for our own identities.Thirdly, you have to reconcile your personal and professional identities. Choose a label too whimsical and you’ll worry that people won’t take you seriously, but choose a label too corporate or commercial and people will think you’re too boring. Striking a balance here is necessary and will vary wildly from industry to industry. Remember you can have multiple labels just like you have a multi-faceted identity2.TS: Just as becoming independent challenges the distinction between work time and personal time, it also challenges the distinction between your professional and personal self-perception. When are you acting as a “consultant” or “freelancer,” and when are you acting as “father” or “partner?” Lines between networking and making friends blur, and it becomes necessary to get comfortable with these overlapping labels.Psychic Armor for the Arena of CapitalismMaking labels is not just aspirational and emotional - there’s one key functional benefit: helping you charge more money for your work.I’ll tell you a secret: every time I send an invoice to a client I want to throw up3.If you Google around everyone will tell you to “raise your rates” or “charge more”. They’re right. But it’s also not so easy!Having the self-confidence and authority to command premium rates is intrinsically linked to a sense of self-worth and identity. And by extension - any doubt or wavering of self-confidence causes psychic trauma / cognitive dissonance when you attempt to attach dollars to your personal identityHow can you solve this? Through a deliberately professional label.Once you find a label that you are not terrified of then you can use that label as psychic armor to create emotional protection from the traumas of capitalism.One has a vague sense of what rate feels too low, but almost anything above that seems too high.You need a construct to do the charging for you.This quote illustrates it really well (bolding mine):  At that point, I was charging $25-30 an hour and loved what I was doing, but soon realized that in my work, I’d often create systems that erased the job I was initially hired to do. That’s when I realized I could start calling myself a consultant. Owning the title “consultant” enabled a psychological shift in the way I thought about the work I was doing. This shift led me to increase my rate again, and eventually to articulate the skills I could offer new clients in the form of a program, complete with a business name, website, and set of rates. Before I articulated this “business offering” in a clear program, my annual revenue was around $40k. After making it clear exactly what I could offer potential clients, and by shifting my offerings based on what I saw clients finding most useful, my revenue jumped to $60k, then $85k, and last year (2018) it was $110k. (Remember, these numbers are revenue, not net profit.)This is from the excellent piece On what it takes to sustain a creative life financially by Sarah Schulweis.This quote resonates with me because I went through the exact same journey - struggling to charge well for my time when I viewed myself as a freelancer or self-employed. Once I started using the word consultant (and started to actually believe it!) I felt more comfortable charging more for my work.For me personally I think not in terms of Tom Critchlow sending you this invoice, but in terms of my consulting business sending you this invoice4.How do you develop your own capitalist construct? It will vary from industry to industry. For me, it’s as simple as leaning on the word “consultant”. For others, creating a “studio” branding might be the construct needed to charge well.The worst thing to do is to let your personal identity be the thing that does the billing (regardless of whether it comes from “your name LLC” or not, don’t let your personal identity be the construct you use)5.TS: Note that even within our professional construct, different situations call for different behaviors. It can be helpful to think of each of these as a micro-label: the me who deals with difficult client stakeholders; the me who can ask to raise my rates; the me who is good at networking; the me who can give a great sales pitch.“The Question” &amp; the identity crisisSooner or later when you’re independent a client will offer you a full time role.Do you want to join the team full time?I’ve been faced with this question no fewer than 5 times in my consulting life and every single time it throws me for an emotional rollercoaster.Talking to others I get the same sense - that even when it’s a company, a role or a salary that is unattractive full-time your mind can’t stop thinking about taking the role6.The reason this question is able to throw you for a loop is because it challenges your self-made identity. It directly confronts and questions your ability to stand behind the labels you’ve chosen - by placing them in contrast to the “authoritative” and “well-understood” and “recognizable” label that they’re offering you.TS: The company has pierced directly through the psychic armour of your professional construct, and made a claim on your identity—they are offering a direct challenge to your label structure, your perception of who you are.There’s two ways to protect yourself from this emotional rollercoaster.Firstly, Don’t let their label over-rule your label. You have a seat at the table - and they can’t take that away from you.TS: The client is offering to change its relationship with you, but don’t forget they still perceive you as a consultant to them. What you have is valuable enough for them to pay the premium rate of an independent consultant. Except for in senior executive roles, joining full time can in fact devalue your work as it becomes more accessible.Secondly, remember that you can retain your identity as a consultant and take a full-time role. Offer to take the role but still bill through your LLC. While this option isn’t exactly viable for many situations it can help your perspective by thinking through this lens.I remember a few years ago when my consulting work slowed down slightly and I took a job interview via a friend. I ended up with a job offer to become Creative Director7 at a digital innovation studio. Despite  the fact that the salary they offered me was half what I earned that year, I almost took the job! I think it would have been a huge mistake but wow do those identity questions make you lose some sleep.Poetry over PowerMany times titles and labels are a show of power. Some display of strength over others. I have this label is the same as saying I have this power.I’d encourage you to think of poetry instead of power. No one has claims on anyone else and part of the freedom of being independent is breaking free from some of those traditional power structures.Use language and labels as a texture to provide as much psychological safety and identity as you need. If you feel less secure - choose labels that are well-understood. If you need to feel like an outsider - choose labels that are unique and unusual8. If you want to be weird, be weird. You can hold a poetry over your own identity this way. Bewitching yourself is completely allowed.From the book Finite &amp; Infinite Games:  “Therefore, poets do not ‘fit’ into society, not because a place is denied them but because they do not take their ‘places’ seriously. They openly see its roles as theatrical, its styles as poses, its clothing costumes, its rules conventional, its crises arranged, its conflicts performed and its metaphysics ideological.”So play with labels, understand their power not over others but over ourselves. Understand their ability to provide an inner confidence and provide shelter in the capitalist storm.            As an independent - putting your website together is like a rite of passage. Everyone struggles with it and you will always have a vague unease with what your personal site says about yourself. &#8617;              As Walt Whitman said in Song of Myself ‘I am large, I contain multitudes!’ &#8617;              File this one under ‘things people don’t tell you when you go independent’ as well &#8617;              I wrestled with a professional identity a while back in this post Why I’ve decided not to launch a brand for my consulting work. While I decided not to create a website and ‘branding’ for this agency called Yes, and… I did end up forming an LLC and use that construct on all my invoices. &#8617;              Interestingly, studies have shown that trading your time for money leads to taking less pleasure in leisure activity. I think a professional label and construct can help alleviate this problem slightly. Also a good reminder to not charge hourly! Day rates are better. &#8617;              To be clear not all full-time roles are bad! And there are legitimate reasons you might want or need to take the role (security, salary, health insurance etc. &#8617;              Notice how I’m still using the label here! I’m using the story and their perceived authority to help position myself as part Creative Director. This emotional journey never ends…. &#8617;              A few labels I love: Alphabet Artist, Media Inventor!

  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/",
  "date": "February 17, 2019",
  "content": "This post is slightly long and slightly technical. The TL;DR is that I built a personal wiki out of files and folders and a few templates in Jekyll hosted on Github Pages. If you want to head straight to the wiki head here: tomcritchlow.com/wiki/ and if you want to skip straight to the technical how-to jump hereFor a while I’ve been searching for better ways of managing my information flows. Catch up by reading my last post of digital streams, campfires and gardens.I left that post with the following concept:Streams - For me this is twitter and is more than enough stream for now.Campfires - For me this is the blog here (and more broadly the blogosphere that I read and engage with). Room to grow here but generally I’m satisfied here.Gardens - This is where there’s a gap for me personally. No place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking. Many of my friends have gravitated to Are.na but I just can’t get it to work for me.For my personal garden (note: your requirements and needs might be different!) I set out to build something that would focus on stock over flow, be a blogging product without a publish button and create a space for collecting the dots.Let’s break those down one by one:Stock over flowIf you’re familiar with this blog then the chances are high that you’ve read this seminal piece from Robin Sloan: stock and flow. Robin lays out (in 2010!) the concept of stock and flow:  Flow is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.  Stock is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.And is clear not to deride flow - it’s the currency of the modern world - but rather to ensure you’re well-balanced:  You can tell that I want you to stop and think about stock here. I feel like we all got really good at flow, really fast. But flow is ephemeral, while stock sticks around. Stock is capital. Stock is protein.  And the real magic trick is to put them both together. To keep the ball bouncing with your flow—to maintain that open channel of communication—while you work on some kick-ass stock in the background. Sacrifice neither. The hybrid strategy.Personally? I’m out of balance. I spend too much time in flow and not nearly enough in stock.A blog without a publish buttonI’m stealing this quote from my modern friend          Ryan also has a nice little idea for modern friends as being something between internet stranger and ‘actual friend’. That’s me and Ryan                Ryan Dawidjan who has been pioneering this concept of open-access writing and blogging without a publish button. For a long time he has maintained a quip file called high cadence thoughts that is open access and serves as a long-running note of his thinking and ideas.It’s a less-performative version of blogging - more of a captain’s log than a broadcast blog.The distinction will come down to how you blog - some people blog in much the same way. For me however blogging is mostly performative thinking and less captain’s log. So I am looking for a space to nurture, edit in real time and evolve my thinking.A space for collecting the dotsThis one might be the most important. Creative research is all about collecting the dots. It’s more common to think of “connecting the dots” but the truth is that you can’t connect the dots you can’t see. And we can only hold a tiny number of things in our brains at once. So a space for collecting (and organizing) the dots is a crucial foundation for thinking, creativity and more:  But ideas aren’t summoned from nowhere: they come from raw material, other ideas or observations about the world. Hence a two-step creative process: collect raw material, then think about it. From this process comes pattern recognition and eventually the insights that form the basis of novel ideas.This quote from the wonderful piece by Ink and Switch: capstone, a tablet for thinking          I’ve not read the book but I think the concept of the slow hunch covers the same ground of collecting the dots and research leading to creative breakthroughs.               .Longevity, text files and foldersThe lightbulb moment for me came by connecting two ideas together:Firstly - apparently, folders and files is the “best in class” tool (better than tags and search) for personal information management          This gem came via the Ink and Switch article linked above.               :  Bergman and Whittaker report that many of us use hierarchical folders for our personal digital organizing. Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it. Because of this, information scientists suggest other methods: search, more flexible than navigating folders; tags, which allow multiple categorizations; and group information management. Yet Bergman and Whittaker have found in their pioneering personal information management research that these other methods that work best for public information management don’t work as well for personal information management.SourceSecondly - I write this blog on Github pages using Jekyll - aka using folders and files!So what if I could build the digital garden I want right here using Jekyll using nothing more than folders and text files?There are a few benefits:  Files and folders feels like it has a long shelf-life. If I’m building this for the long-term (and I think I am) then I want a format I can back-up, archive and re-publish in the future independent of platform.  Using files and folders allows me to drag and drop files into my wiki with zero authoring - CSV, pdf, png and txt files all are hosted and contained gracefully  It’s robust since I can back up this wiki folder to any service, dropbox, Google Drive, Github, etc.How it all worksFor those that aren’t so interested in the technical details you can skip past this section.So the core of this project is that something robust and simple like files and folders like this:Is published looking something like this:Browse the HTML version here: tomcritchlow.com/wikiFor those comfortable reading Jekyll code then you can dive right in on Github here: https://github.com/tomcritchlow/tomcritchlow.github.ioThe broad-strokes overview is as follows          All of this is subject to change - consider this V0.1. This project is not finished, and by it’s nature may in fact never be finished!               :  The wiki folder is made of a series of folders - each one containing any kind of files.  Markdown files are treated as pages  Image files are displayed as thumbnails with a link to the image, with the filename displayed to store any kind of title you want  PDf, CSV, txt files and anything else are displayed with a link to the file.  The “magic” comes from each wiki folder having an index.html file which handles all of the display by using a custom layout wikiindex  The root wiki page loops through all the files to create a master index automatically. Code here.  Of course, the meat of the wiki is contained in note files which are just markdown files so easily portable. I intentionally designed the wiki to not rely on a ton of front-matter for portability and simplicity. To do this I added a default layout to wiki files in the config file.  It’s not all about layout though - it’s about presentation too. I added a single flag to the wikiindex frontmatter for “expand” to be true or false that displays the notes either fully expanded or as simple links. My parenting wiki is an example of the notes expanded, while my drafts folder is just a list of links because it’s long.  Finally, where I have a long list of links I added the ability for individual notes to be “pinned” to the top of the page to ensure more important or frequently-used links are easy to find.Phew. So this all sounds rather complicated - and especially for programming n00b like myself some of the bits felt like hard work to get right. But it’s important that all of the complexity and “programming” lies in the layout and index files and none of the complexity lies in the files and folders which remain text files for longevity and easy portability. I doubt it would overly simple but I also doubt it would be hard to port this across to Hugo or Wordpress or something else in the future.Some other interesting wikisCredit for inspiration for this whole project comes from a variety of wikis and wiki-like collections on the web:buster.wiki/ - Strong design and everything has a date by the looks of it which enables an RSS feed. Very polished and thought through.are.na - A platform that all the cool kids use for building personal knowledge libraries. Lightly social, perhaps the right answer but slightly questionable if they’ll be around for a long time. Ymmv.Brendan’s /canon - this was part of the original inspiration for me. A curated list of pure stock - things that Brendan returns to again and again. He has a template you can copy too.Worrydream’s quotes page - just a massive list of interesting quotes collected by Brett Victor. Notice how being one giant page makes it instantly searchable.daywreckers.com - from Ben Pieratt, not quite a wiki but a very minimal site designed to collect the dots.

  "title": "Exploring the UX of web-annotations",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/12/annotations/",
  "date": "February 12, 2019",
  "content": "In my post experiments in networked writing I explored some ideas about how to put the network back in networked writing. In particular, I have a theory that the comments are actually the interesting unit of the blog, not the post.  The idea that blogs exist within the network is crucial to understanding the medium (the medium is the message - could one say the blogosphere is the blog?).This has been bubbling in my mind for a long time with no satisfactory way forward but it came up again because of the Augmenting Human Intellect project which is going on right now. It looks like a lot of fun and is very interesting - it’s basically a crowd-swarm of in-line commenting on Douglas Engelbart’s famous paper Augmenting Human Intellect.You can read the background on the project here.And you can see the paper and annotations live here.Great! Except… it all runs on top of Hypothesis. I know very little about them but it really seems like they’re trying very hard to build a robust, long-term utility for the web which is awesome. Except their UI leaves a lot to be desired. Especially on mobile.So it felt like a good time to take a quick peek at a few common design patterns and think about some ways forward.HypothesisThe Hypothesis annotation layer is typically displayed by default. You can see some common mobile screens here:And you can play around with it yourself on this demo page I set up.Some observations:  By having the comment “drawer” on the side always on it is a very prominent and visual part of the page. It’s hard to implement without “getting in the way” of the page design. I’m sure there are options to install hidden by default but this default design pattern matters.  The open and close UX interferes with the site’s UX (on my site for example opening and closing the drawer can interfere with the home, menu links causing a page transition)  Features-wise, it’s the best tool out there - there’s options for public/private/closed groups, threading annotations, annotating PDFs and more. There’s also a robust ecosystem of tools to follow users, monitor site annotations etc.  Note their new experimental UI is a little cleaner but still doesn’t feel like it’s a joy to use.GeniusGenius is basically “the other” annotation layer for the web and is sometimes even used by “real” newsrooms. Likely because of the polished UI. Some common mobile screens:And you can play around with it yourself on this demo page I set  up.Some observations:  The annotation layer is hidden by default which feels like a more respectful design choice.  The “X” to close the annotation layer is in the “right” place and doesn’t interfere with the page underneath.

  "content": "In my post experiments in networked writing I explored some ideas about how to put the network back in networked writing. In particular, I have a theory that the comments are actually the interesting unit of the blog, not the post.  The idea that blogs exist within the network is crucial to understanding the medium (the medium is the message - could one say the blogosphere is the blog?).This has been bubbling in my mind for a long time with no satisfactory way forward but it came up again because of the Augmenting Human Intellect project which is going on right now. It looks like a lot of fun and is very interesting - it’s basically a crowd-swarm of in-line commenting on Douglas Engelbart’s famous paper Augmenting Human Intellect.You can read the background on the project here.And you can see the paper and annotations live here.Great! Except… it all runs on top of Hypothesis. I know very little about them but it really seems like they’re trying very hard to build a robust, long-term utility for the web which is awesome. Except their UI leaves a lot to be desired. Especially on mobile.So it felt like a good time to take a quick peek at a few common design patterns and think about some ways forward.HypothesisThe Hypothesis annotation layer is typically displayed by default. You can see some common mobile screens here:And you can play around with it yourself on this demo page I set up.Some observations:  By having the comment “drawer” on the side always on it is a very prominent and visual part of the page. It’s hard to implement without “getting in the way” of the page design. I’m sure there are options to install hidden by default but this default design pattern matters.  The open and close UX interferes with the site’s UX (on my site for example opening and closing the drawer can interfere with the home, menu links causing a page transition)  Features-wise, it’s the best tool out there - there’s options for public/private/closed groups, threading annotations, annotating PDFs and more. There’s also a robust ecosystem of tools to follow users, monitor site annotations etc.  Note their new experimental UI is a little cleaner but still doesn’t feel like it’s a joy to use.GeniusGenius is basically “the other” annotation layer for the web and is sometimes even used by “real” newsrooms. Likely because of the polished UI. Some common mobile screens:And you can play around with it yourself on this demo page I set  up.Some observations:  The annotation layer is hidden by default which feels like a more respectful design choice.  The “X” to close the annotation layer is in the “right” place and doesn’t interfere with the page underneath.

  "date": "October 29, 2018",
  "content": "  “One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in.” - Marshall McLuhan  “First, The fish needs to say, ‘Something ain’t right about this Camel ride – And I’m Feeling so damn Thirsty.’” - HafizAs a consultant it’s important to recognize that one of the strongest forces inside an organization is their culture. It’s why my personal mantra is a reframing of the classic:(Their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast.It’s my theory that to be an effective consultant you need to learn how to understand culture - you need to learn ways of seeing your client’s organization. In this post I’ll walk through some frameworks and concepts for doing just that.But I’ll go one step further and suggest that understanding an organization’s culture is the whole game and that teaching your clients to see is the ultimate pinnacle of a consultant’s work.First though, a walk in London some time ago….A walk with an anthropologist in LondonA few years ago I was walking with a friend through the streets of London. I’d been working at Google for a while and I was frustrated at not being able to get my ideas turned into reality. My friend, a philosopher and anthropologist, just laughed at me and said: (I’m paraphrasing - sorry H)  “You’re an idiot. There are thirty thousand people working at Google. If everyone as far down the food chain as you could get their ideas made it would be chaos. The system is explicitly designed to prevent your individual ideas from mattering one bit”This was a lightbulb moment for me. Of course. Every organization is a system and process designed for certain outcomes - while some change is accepted and embraced, the point of the organization - its structure, processes and hierarchy - are there to prevent individuals from derailing the whole machine.The rhetoric of “ideas can come from anywhere” and “act like a startup” sound good but they’re just not true reflections of the lived experience inside a large organization like Google (or any other). The truth is that large organizations are both explicitly and implicitly designed to prevent too many new ideas from emerging.The Frustration of StabilityAs a consultant or changemaker, this frustration can be very common. You are convinced that you have a good idea but feel unable to convince the organization. Or you have convinced the organization on an idea but feel frustrated that you just can’t get it done.It’s important to recognize that most organizational change happens very slowly and starts very small. And this is as it should be. Consider the alternative - can you imagine an organization that was reinventing itself every time a consultant walked in the door?This frustration is an emotion you can channel into focus. Changing a stable organization requires first understanding its context. And when you walk into a client’s office, you’re  always missing context. Sometimes there’s business context you’re missing - funding, acquisitions, business models. Sure. But more often it’s about missing cultural context. Your ideas are being rejected like a virus by the antibodies of the company.Ever since writing The Consultant’s Grain it’s become a mantra of mine that “(their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast”. It’s a reframing of the classic “culture eats strategy for breakfast” and it helps me stay focused - especially as a consultant coming into an unfamiliar environment and trying to get things done1.However, the client usually isn’t paying you to understand their culture so you have to do it fast. I think this is a skill, something you can learn. This skill of sensemaking takes experience of different cultures and a strong sense of observation.Enter John BergerArt has a lot to teach the business world. It’s the best place to learn the skills of sensemaking and observation. John Berger had a wonderful TV show on the BBC in the 70s called “ways of seeing”. The opening scene is a thing of beauty.Without talking, John walks to a renaissance painting, framed on the wall of a gallery and pulls out a knife. The gentle ripping of the canvas is all you hear as he carefully cuts out a portion of the painting. It’s a shocking scene that instantly makes you pay attention.The whole thing happens in the first twenty seconds. Watch it here:It’s an unsettling scene - even when you know it’s coming! Recognizing why this scene is shocking helps us understand culture. No one tells you if the works on the wall are priceless. But the signals are all there - a gallery setting. A TV show about art. You’re not expecting him to walk up with a knife… It’s not what’s done.John Berger goes on to talk about critical ways of understanding art, primarily through learning to critically examine something in front of you by keeping the context in frame. Who is showing this art to you? What sensory cues are there to shape your perception? How does reproduction of the image affect the image itself?These questions and ways of seeing are the same exercises I employ as soon as I engage with a new client. Attempting to actually see what’s there - not what everyone around you assumes is there, and certainly not what you’re told about “how things work”.I just came off a project where after a large acquisition there were two teams learning to work together. This caused incredible frustration for both sides - both everyday frustrations at different processes and approaches but slower moving structures below the surface about values and mental models of how the world works. These caused tensions, clashes and more.I won’t pretend to have solved all of these frustrations (and I wasn’t being paid to solve these - at least not directly!) but the very first thing you can do in this situation is try and look critically and honestly at what is there.Especially when you’re early in a project, before you’re supposed to have gained any knowledge it’s a great time to try and provoke some reactions (whether you go so far as slashing a painting is is up to you!). By pushing against the system in new and interesting ways you can learn a lot about the system by how it responds.You need to get in the client’s flowTo understand context and get a feel for culture, you need to find ways of getting “close enough to smell the client”.Context and culture happen at the in-between moments, spaces and projects. How does the team handle crisis? How does the team handle group meetings? What does down-time look like? How are new team members welcomed onto the team?If you’re too distant from these in-between moments it’s almost impossible to properly understand the culture.So as a consultant - as an outsider - it’s crucial to find ways to get embedded inside the organization. You need to get close enough to be inside the flows and streams of work. Increasingly there is a duality - the physical environment and the digital one - where different modes and types of work get to happen.It’s important to be present in both.Being physically present gives you a sense of the emotional interactions, in-between spaces and so on. It also gives you the platform necessary to build the emotional capital required to ask for favors.Being digitally present gives you the tactical understanding of how projects, documents and tasks flow around. It’s also a great way to get a glimpse of the knowledge work happening around you that you aren’t directly involved in.Once you’re inside the flows it’s your job to pay attention.Understanding Culture 101 - what are we trying to see?It’s helpful to have some frameworks to help us think through the kinds of things we’re trying to see in the first place.This framework from ethnography2 is a simple and memorable framework that shows how you can think about the ways culture can manifest and reinforce itself (the four A’s):In this framework the actors, artifacts and activities interact directly with each other. And they all exist within a wider atmosphere.Actors - these are the people in the frame. I love the word “actors” since everyone is performing a role. The theatre of work is the epic play of our lives and the office (both physical and digital) is the stage. Notice how people behave, the language they use and their intrinsic motivations.Artifacts - these are the visible extensions, the “tangible” assets created by the actors. This might be everything from the design of a report to the structure of a paid leave policy.Activities - the things that the actors do and why they do it. These activities will tell you more about the underlying power structures. In particular, pay attention to the habits and routines that are in place. Nothing will tell you more about what people value than what they do repeatedly.Atmosphere - this is the wider environment in which we’re working. Is the team or organization part of a bigger structure? How is the physical office laid out? In the digital space are they using Slack or Basecamp and what is the tone of conversation there? Which design choices were put in place deliberately and who made them?There are many frameworks and mental models that can help you understand and grapple with culture.  ”Principles of Management”, chapter 8 is a great primer on organizational culture and has a model for the 8 “dimensions” of organization culture3.You can imagine every organization as having each of these aspects to a greater or lesser extent. So you might think about “plotting” a company along each axis. This is an example I put together from a recent client engagement:You can see for example that I’ve mapped them as “unstable” and “process oriented” - which makes sense since my role with this client engagement was to create new processes.I’ve found this framework helpful when trying to distinguish between things like intrinsic motivation (e.g. “we want to build the best X”) vs extrinsic motivation (e.g. “we want to beat competitor Y”).Once you start plotting an organization on these dimensions of culture you can start to look at each one and think about why they are that way and how they reinforce that behavior.How to see the world through your client’s eyesWhen you’re trying to understand a company’s culture, you’re essentially trying to understand how they see. The lens through which they process the world around them.This manifests in three specific things to pay attention to: language, delusions &amp; mythology.LanguageThe naming of things is incredibly powerful. First a group will create language as shortcuts for ideas and values - ways of thinking. But gradually this language starts to create the group. First the group creates the language and then the language creates the group. Language is the reinforcing feedback loop of culture.There are two extensions from this - firstly that using the wrong language can alienate you from a group. As a consultant I try hard to use a variety of definitions, terminology and linguistic approaches. Using the wrong term once is no big deal, but consistently referring to the concept that the group has learned to reject will get you rejected as well.Secondly - a skilled poet or linguist can create new language for groups. Language that has embedded values, ideas or bias from the consultant.My friend Brian calls this skill noticing and naming. It’s the essential task of the consultant to pay close attention and then attach new language to important ideas4. By naming things you can drive attention to what’s important and hence shape the way an organization behaves.For a wonderful poetic read on the power of language in organizations I’d encourage you to read Notes on the Role of Leadership and Language in Regenerating Organizations, a.k.a. The Little Grey Book.Look at this quote from The Little Grey Book by Dr. Michael Geoghegan  Managers understand the organization’s past behavior.  But this knowledge,  and the language that accompanies it,  limit their vision  of the organization’s potential future state.  Using the language of the past,  managers may try to provide a vision for the future.  But it is an old future  a memory of what the future could be.  Managers may strive for fundamental change,  but their language prevents them from achieving it.The whole book is worth reading and has tons of wisdom, especially on the pragmatic nature of introducing new language and the efficiency of old language5.Shared DelusionsShared Delusions - In order for teams to function effectively they need a shared mental model of how the world works for their industry/niche.This mental model helps the team act quickly by working from a shared cheat-sheet of understanding. It saves having to make every decision from first principles. I like to call this mental model a “shared delusion”.Why a shared delusion? Because it’s useful to recognize that any mental model of how the world works is an incomplete model. The idea of a shared delusion is that we’re understanding head first that we’re lying to ourselves about certain things to make it easier for us to make decisions or rationalize our behavior.The problem is that many mental models (i.e. shared delusions) about the world are built implicitly and not explicitly so that it becomes hard to tell which piece of the mental model is a useful simplification and which piece of the mental model is an oversimplification (or a flawed assumption).So let’s call the mental model what it is - a delusion - and try and understand how we look at the mental model directly to better understand it’s limitations and flaws.As a consultant - with experience likely across more industries than those inside the organization - you are in a unique position to separate out which parts of the shared mental model of the world are useful shortcuts and which are flawed ideas. Reinforce and strengthen the useful shortcuts (or make new ones) while deconstructing and weakening the flawed ideas.I’ll give you an example from my own work - a B2B client had seriously under-invested in design. Partly under the assumption that in the B2B space “it wasn’t as important as for B2C” and that their sites were “good enough already”. These kinds of assumptions about the world were repeated and interpreted differently throughout the organization but no one was challenging them directly. I wrote more about the methodology over in my post how do you measure good content but a survey against their competitors was akin to taking a knife to their painting. It sent a shock through the organization and I presented this table at an executive all-hands:There’s two lessons here - firstly if you want to understand shared assumptions sometimes you have to go to the source - surveying users, asking customers questions, etc.Secondly - always try and create an objective counter to their subjective reality &amp; be gentle when challenging mental models - no one enjoys their view of reality being broken.MythologyMythology -  In times of stress, culture is a strong force that binds teams together. Culture can be the light at the end of the tunnel. Connections and bonds are formed in times of struggle and stress. From these challenging times come stories - stories of how it went down. Stories of heroics, stories of failures, stories of late nights, stories of product launches.These stories become mythology within the organization. Very rarely are these documented - we’re looking for the oral history of the company and you’ll often get the best version of these out of the office. (At the bar or on the walk to lunch).Pay attention and listen carefully to the mythology - actively look to uncover these stories of projects past. These stories, often-repeated, contain lessons about value systems within the organization. But the lessons they tell usually bear little to no resemblance of truth of what might succeed or fail in the future.The key insight here is that every single new project will get compared to the myths. So you can’t understand the context of your ideas and recommendations without first understanding the mythology.Tread lightly when following the footsteps of glory or failure - both are dangerous paths to follow.Culture vs PropagandaBeware documented culture. For all of this talk about company culture I’ve found that it can be misleading to rely on mission decks and documented company values. These are top-down objects that are at best out of date and usually contain at least one statement that is the opposite of the truth6. A mandate rather than an observation. (After all the only reason to document culture is to change it.)My favorite illustration of corporate propaganda is Facebook’s “culture” of “move fast with stable infrastructure”. It’s a mock up of a poster that Zuckerberg is showing at a conference where the letters are on screen taller than he is, literally larger than life:The interesting thing is that the only images you can find are the keynote mockups of the poster. There appear to be no actual posters of this manifesto.I’d go further and say that it is an impossible object. It’s impossible to make a poster with this phrase on. Why? Because anyone (and especially Facebook employees) who reads this poster is actually translating it in their mind into the actual poster of “move fast and break things”. Nothing has changed about their culture.So seek out the internal culture decks, they’re useful starting points. Consume them. But don’t trust them.Three BreakthroughsThe first breakthrough I had as a consultant was to understand that there is very little objective truth in business. What works for one business doesn’t always work for another. Every strategy is a reflection of the business you’re working with and the environment they’re in. There is no “just do X” recommendation in the real world, only in dusty, discarded strategy documents. This quote has stuck with me from Tomasz Tunguz’s Overfitting in Business:  As I study and meet and analyze more and more businesses, I find myself drawn to the idea that each is a snowflake. Each startup is unique composition of its team, in the circumstances of its genesis, and the ecosystem in which it blossoms. Business concepts like the ones mentioned above can provide a common language about ideas. They can help us tell stories to motivate and inspire. Perhaps, they can provide some form of analytical framework.  But until the success of these theories can stand the test of reproducibility or time, that’s all they should be. After all, even some of the most successful CEOs in the world cannot reproduce their success the second time or third time. Building a business is really hard, and building an enduring company even more so, because each enduring business is built in a different way.The second breakthrough I had was to understand that there is a depth to observing a business. Learning ways of seeing, recognizing culture as a powerful force and attempting to observe the realities of the organization rather than passively taking for granted the received wisdom leads to strong insights.Without ways of seeing the premise of consulting falls apart - you make generic recommendations that are easily rejected by the organizations belief systems and culture. Recommendations that fail to create new language or any meaningful change.The third breakthrough I had - from reflecting on past client engagements, sometimes lasting years - was that the most important and most meaningful work I’ve done for clients is to help them see. Help them see their own culture in new ways, or help them see the world around them.By sharing these ways of seeing with your client you can develop a shared perspective of the road ahead.Teaching your client to see“A people or a class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act as a people or a class than one that has been able to situate itself in history.” - John BergerAnd so, finally we arrive back where we started. How do you teach ways of seeing? How do you challenge assumptions, create new contexts or add new naming?Watching Ways of Seeing the first time was useful to help me see. The second time was useful to help me teach others how to see.Re-watch the first twenty seconds. We can hear the gentle ripping of the canvas in a new perspective. Why is this scene so unsettling? Why is it effective?So take a good look at the client and when you are seeing clearly, take a knife to the walls and help them see what’s there.–Much love to the folks who contributed and reviewed drafts of this piece including: Kit, Brian, Toby, Sean, Robin, Susie, Rachel, Thomas, Elan &amp; ErinIf you made it this far (firstly thanks!) but you might be interested to know this was a bit of an experiment. I’m consciously trying to extend my writing to be a little longer as I gear up to write a book on consulting for independents. For now, I’ve collected all my strategy writing here.–            In The Consultant’s Grain I explore more deliberately the difference between working on projects that go with the grain or against the grain of an organization via the idea of consulting fast and slow. I’m not going to repeat all that here but if you enjoy this piece queue that one up next! &#8617;              The full paper is worth checking out: Laurel Anderson and Paul Rothstein (2004) ,’Creativity and Innovation: Consumer Research and Scenario Building’ although in this context doesn’t give much else of use to understand organizational culture. &#8617;              I’ve slightly adapted the dimensions of culture presented in the book below to create axis but the original chapter is still very much worth reading, and it’s short. &#8617;              My friend Thomas makes a good point here that you need to be careful not to go overboard - attempting to add large amounts of language to a team will create confusion and also dilute the language being introduced. &#8617;              Thanks to Robin for sharing this one with me! &#8617;              My friend Kit was wise to point out this might be framed slighty negatively - there is a ton of value of documenting culture and creating culture decks. It’s just my experience that you can’t completely trust them. But definitely don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater here. &#8617;      "

  "content": "  “One thing about which fish know exactly nothing is water, since they have no anti-environment which would enable them to perceive the element they live in.” - Marshall McLuhan  “First, The fish needs to say, ‘Something ain’t right about this Camel ride – And I’m Feeling so damn Thirsty.’” - HafizAs a consultant it’s important to recognize that one of the strongest forces inside an organization is their culture. It’s why my personal mantra is a reframing of the classic:(Their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast.It’s my theory that to be an effective consultant you need to learn how to understand culture - you need to learn ways of seeing your client’s organization. In this post I’ll walk through some frameworks and concepts for doing just that.But I’ll go one step further and suggest that understanding an organization’s culture is the whole game and that teaching your clients to see is the ultimate pinnacle of a consultant’s work.First though, a walk in London some time ago….A walk with an anthropologist in LondonA few years ago I was walking with a friend through the streets of London. I’d been working at Google for a while and I was frustrated at not being able to get my ideas turned into reality. My friend, a philosopher and anthropologist, just laughed at me and said: (I’m paraphrasing - sorry H)  “You’re an idiot. There are thirty thousand people working at Google. If everyone as far down the food chain as you could get their ideas made it would be chaos. The system is explicitly designed to prevent your individual ideas from mattering one bit”This was a lightbulb moment for me. Of course. Every organization is a system and process designed for certain outcomes - while some change is accepted and embraced, the point of the organization - its structure, processes and hierarchy - are there to prevent individuals from derailing the whole machine.The rhetoric of “ideas can come from anywhere” and “act like a startup” sound good but they’re just not true reflections of the lived experience inside a large organization like Google (or any other). The truth is that large organizations are both explicitly and implicitly designed to prevent too many new ideas from emerging.The Frustration of StabilityAs a consultant or changemaker, this frustration can be very common. You are convinced that you have a good idea but feel unable to convince the organization. Or you have convinced the organization on an idea but feel frustrated that you just can’t get it done.It’s important to recognize that most organizational change happens very slowly and starts very small. And this is as it should be. Consider the alternative - can you imagine an organization that was reinventing itself every time a consultant walked in the door?This frustration is an emotion you can channel into focus. Changing a stable organization requires first understanding its context. And when you walk into a client’s office, you’re  always missing context. Sometimes there’s business context you’re missing - funding, acquisitions, business models. Sure. But more often it’s about missing cultural context. Your ideas are being rejected like a virus by the antibodies of the company.Ever since writing The Consultant’s Grain it’s become a mantra of mine that “(their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast”. It’s a reframing of the classic “culture eats strategy for breakfast” and it helps me stay focused - especially as a consultant coming into an unfamiliar environment and trying to get things done1.However, the client usually isn’t paying you to understand their culture so you have to do it fast. I think this is a skill, something you can learn. This skill of sensemaking takes experience of different cultures and a strong sense of observation.Enter John BergerArt has a lot to teach the business world. It’s the best place to learn the skills of sensemaking and observation. John Berger had a wonderful TV show on the BBC in the 70s called “ways of seeing”. The opening scene is a thing of beauty.Without talking, John walks to a renaissance painting, framed on the wall of a gallery and pulls out a knife. The gentle ripping of the canvas is all you hear as he carefully cuts out a portion of the painting. It’s a shocking scene that instantly makes you pay attention.The whole thing happens in the first twenty seconds. Watch it here:It’s an unsettling scene - even when you know it’s coming! Recognizing why this scene is shocking helps us understand culture. No one tells you if the works on the wall are priceless. But the signals are all there - a gallery setting. A TV show about art. You’re not expecting him to walk up with a knife… It’s not what’s done.John Berger goes on to talk about critical ways of understanding art, primarily through learning to critically examine something in front of you by keeping the context in frame. Who is showing this art to you? What sensory cues are there to shape your perception? How does reproduction of the image affect the image itself?These questions and ways of seeing are the same exercises I employ as soon as I engage with a new client. Attempting to actually see what’s there - not what everyone around you assumes is there, and certainly not what you’re told about “how things work”.I just came off a project where after a large acquisition there were two teams learning to work together. This caused incredible frustration for both sides - both everyday frustrations at different processes and approaches but slower moving structures below the surface about values and mental models of how the world works. These caused tensions, clashes and more.I won’t pretend to have solved all of these frustrations (and I wasn’t being paid to solve these - at least not directly!) but the very first thing you can do in this situation is try and look critically and honestly at what is there.Especially when you’re early in a project, before you’re supposed to have gained any knowledge it’s a great time to try and provoke some reactions (whether you go so far as slashing a painting is is up to you!). By pushing against the system in new and interesting ways you can learn a lot about the system by how it responds.You need to get in the client’s flowTo understand context and get a feel for culture, you need to find ways of getting “close enough to smell the client”.Context and culture happen at the in-between moments, spaces and projects. How does the team handle crisis? How does the team handle group meetings? What does down-time look like? How are new team members welcomed onto the team?If you’re too distant from these in-between moments it’s almost impossible to properly understand the culture.So as a consultant - as an outsider - it’s crucial to find ways to get embedded inside the organization. You need to get close enough to be inside the flows and streams of work. Increasingly there is a duality - the physical environment and the digital one - where different modes and types of work get to happen.It’s important to be present in both.Being physically present gives you a sense of the emotional interactions, in-between spaces and so on. It also gives you the platform necessary to build the emotional capital required to ask for favors.Being digitally present gives you the tactical understanding of how projects, documents and tasks flow around. It’s also a great way to get a glimpse of the knowledge work happening around you that you aren’t directly involved in.Once you’re inside the flows it’s your job to pay attention.Understanding Culture 101 - what are we trying to see?It’s helpful to have some frameworks to help us think through the kinds of things we’re trying to see in the first place.This framework from ethnography2 is a simple and memorable framework that shows how you can think about the ways culture can manifest and reinforce itself (the four A’s):In this framework the actors, artifacts and activities interact directly with each other. And they all exist within a wider atmosphere.Actors - these are the people in the frame. I love the word “actors” since everyone is performing a role. The theatre of work is the epic play of our lives and the office (both physical and digital) is the stage. Notice how people behave, the language they use and their intrinsic motivations.Artifacts - these are the visible extensions, the “tangible” assets created by the actors. This might be everything from the design of a report to the structure of a paid leave policy.Activities - the things that the actors do and why they do it. These activities will tell you more about the underlying power structures. In particular, pay attention to the habits and routines that are in place. Nothing will tell you more about what people value than what they do repeatedly.Atmosphere - this is the wider environment in which we’re working. Is the team or organization part of a bigger structure? How is the physical office laid out? In the digital space are they using Slack or Basecamp and what is the tone of conversation there? Which design choices were put in place deliberately and who made them?There are many frameworks and mental models that can help you understand and grapple with culture.  ”Principles of Management”, chapter 8 is a great primer on organizational culture and has a model for the 8 “dimensions” of organization culture3.You can imagine every organization as having each of these aspects to a greater or lesser extent. So you might think about “plotting” a company along each axis. This is an example I put together from a recent client engagement:You can see for example that I’ve mapped them as “unstable” and “process oriented” - which makes sense since my role with this client engagement was to create new processes.I’ve found this framework helpful when trying to distinguish between things like intrinsic motivation (e.g. “we want to build the best X”) vs extrinsic motivation (e.g. “we want to beat competitor Y”).Once you start plotting an organization on these dimensions of culture you can start to look at each one and think about why they are that way and how they reinforce that behavior.How to see the world through your client’s eyesWhen you’re trying to understand a company’s culture, you’re essentially trying to understand how they see. The lens through which they process the world around them.This manifests in three specific things to pay attention to: language, delusions &amp; mythology.LanguageThe naming of things is incredibly powerful. First a group will create language as shortcuts for ideas and values - ways of thinking. But gradually this language starts to create the group. First the group creates the language and then the language creates the group. Language is the reinforcing feedback loop of culture.There are two extensions from this - firstly that using the wrong language can alienate you from a group. As a consultant I try hard to use a variety of definitions, terminology and linguistic approaches. Using the wrong term once is no big deal, but consistently referring to the concept that the group has learned to reject will get you rejected as well.Secondly - a skilled poet or linguist can create new language for groups. Language that has embedded values, ideas or bias from the consultant.My friend Brian calls this skill noticing and naming. It’s the essential task of the consultant to pay close attention and then attach new language to important ideas4. By naming things you can drive attention to what’s important and hence shape the way an organization behaves.For a wonderful poetic read on the power of language in organizations I’d encourage you to read Notes on the Role of Leadership and Language in Regenerating Organizations, a.k.a. The Little Grey Book.Look at this quote from The Little Grey Book by Dr. Michael Geoghegan  Managers understand the organization’s past behavior.  But this knowledge,  and the language that accompanies it,  limit their vision  of the organization’s potential future state.  Using the language of the past,  managers may try to provide a vision for the future.  But it is an old future  a memory of what the future could be.  Managers may strive for fundamental change,  but their language prevents them from achieving it.The whole book is worth reading and has tons of wisdom, especially on the pragmatic nature of introducing new language and the efficiency of old language5.Shared DelusionsShared Delusions - In order for teams to function effectively they need a shared mental model of how the world works for their industry/niche.This mental model helps the team act quickly by working from a shared cheat-sheet of understanding. It saves having to make every decision from first principles. I like to call this mental model a “shared delusion”.Why a shared delusion? Because it’s useful to recognize that any mental model of how the world works is an incomplete model. The idea of a shared delusion is that we’re understanding head first that we’re lying to ourselves about certain things to make it easier for us to make decisions or rationalize our behavior.The problem is that many mental models (i.e. shared delusions) about the world are built implicitly and not explicitly so that it becomes hard to tell which piece of the mental model is a useful simplification and which piece of the mental model is an oversimplification (or a flawed assumption).So let’s call the mental model what it is - a delusion - and try and understand how we look at the mental model directly to better understand it’s limitations and flaws.As a consultant - with experience likely across more industries than those inside the organization - you are in a unique position to separate out which parts of the shared mental model of the world are useful shortcuts and which are flawed ideas. Reinforce and strengthen the useful shortcuts (or make new ones) while deconstructing and weakening the flawed ideas.I’ll give you an example from my own work - a B2B client had seriously under-invested in design. Partly under the assumption that in the B2B space “it wasn’t as important as for B2C” and that their sites were “good enough already”. These kinds of assumptions about the world were repeated and interpreted differently throughout the organization but no one was challenging them directly. I wrote more about the methodology over in my post how do you measure good content but a survey against their competitors was akin to taking a knife to their painting. It sent a shock through the organization and I presented this table at an executive all-hands:There’s two lessons here - firstly if you want to understand shared assumptions sometimes you have to go to the source - surveying users, asking customers questions, etc.Secondly - always try and create an objective counter to their subjective reality &amp; be gentle when challenging mental models - no one enjoys their view of reality being broken.MythologyMythology -  In times of stress, culture is a strong force that binds teams together. Culture can be the light at the end of the tunnel. Connections and bonds are formed in times of struggle and stress. From these challenging times come stories - stories of how it went down. Stories of heroics, stories of failures, stories of late nights, stories of product launches.These stories become mythology within the organization. Very rarely are these documented - we’re looking for the oral history of the company and you’ll often get the best version of these out of the office. (At the bar or on the walk to lunch).Pay attention and listen carefully to the mythology - actively look to uncover these stories of projects past. These stories, often-repeated, contain lessons about value systems within the organization. But the lessons they tell usually bear little to no resemblance of truth of what might succeed or fail in the future.The key insight here is that every single new project will get compared to the myths. So you can’t understand the context of your ideas and recommendations without first understanding the mythology.Tread lightly when following the footsteps of glory or failure - both are dangerous paths to follow.Culture vs PropagandaBeware documented culture. For all of this talk about company culture I’ve found that it can be misleading to rely on mission decks and documented company values. These are top-down objects that are at best out of date and usually contain at least one statement that is the opposite of the truth6. A mandate rather than an observation. (After all the only reason to document culture is to change it.)My favorite illustration of corporate propaganda is Facebook’s “culture” of “move fast with stable infrastructure”. It’s a mock up of a poster that Zuckerberg is showing at a conference where the letters are on screen taller than he is, literally larger than life:The interesting thing is that the only images you can find are the keynote mockups of the poster. There appear to be no actual posters of this manifesto.I’d go further and say that it is an impossible object. It’s impossible to make a poster with this phrase on. Why? Because anyone (and especially Facebook employees) who reads this poster is actually translating it in their mind into the actual poster of “move fast and break things”. Nothing has changed about their culture.So seek out the internal culture decks, they’re useful starting points. Consume them. But don’t trust them.Three BreakthroughsThe first breakthrough I had as a consultant was to understand that there is very little objective truth in business. What works for one business doesn’t always work for another. Every strategy is a reflection of the business you’re working with and the environment they’re in. There is no “just do X” recommendation in the real world, only in dusty, discarded strategy documents. This quote has stuck with me from Tomasz Tunguz’s Overfitting in Business:  As I study and meet and analyze more and more businesses, I find myself drawn to the idea that each is a snowflake. Each startup is unique composition of its team, in the circumstances of its genesis, and the ecosystem in which it blossoms. Business concepts like the ones mentioned above can provide a common language about ideas. They can help us tell stories to motivate and inspire. Perhaps, they can provide some form of analytical framework.  But until the success of these theories can stand the test of reproducibility or time, that’s all they should be. After all, even some of the most successful CEOs in the world cannot reproduce their success the second time or third time. Building a business is really hard, and building an enduring company even more so, because each enduring business is built in a different way.The second breakthrough I had was to understand that there is a depth to observing a business. Learning ways of seeing, recognizing culture as a powerful force and attempting to observe the realities of the organization rather than passively taking for granted the received wisdom leads to strong insights.Without ways of seeing the premise of consulting falls apart - you make generic recommendations that are easily rejected by the organizations belief systems and culture. Recommendations that fail to create new language or any meaningful change.The third breakthrough I had - from reflecting on past client engagements, sometimes lasting years - was that the most important and most meaningful work I’ve done for clients is to help them see. Help them see their own culture in new ways, or help them see the world around them.By sharing these ways of seeing with your client you can develop a shared perspective of the road ahead.Teaching your client to see“A people or a class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act as a people or a class than one that has been able to situate itself in history.” - John BergerAnd so, finally we arrive back where we started. How do you teach ways of seeing? How do you challenge assumptions, create new contexts or add new naming?Watching Ways of Seeing the first time was useful to help me see. The second time was useful to help me teach others how to see.Re-watch the first twenty seconds. We can hear the gentle ripping of the canvas in a new perspective. Why is this scene so unsettling? Why is it effective?So take a good look at the client and when you are seeing clearly, take a knife to the walls and help them see what’s there.–Much love to the folks who contributed and reviewed drafts of this piece including: Kit, Brian, Toby, Sean, Robin, Susie, Rachel, Thomas, Elan &amp; ErinIf you made it this far (firstly thanks!) but you might be interested to know this was a bit of an experiment. I’m consciously trying to extend my writing to be a little longer as I gear up to write a book on consulting for independents. For now, I’ve collected all my strategy writing here.–            In The Consultant’s Grain I explore more deliberately the difference between working on projects that go with the grain or against the grain of an organization via the idea of consulting fast and slow.

A daily source of inspiration and grounding. And a constant reminder of how important a flexible schedule is as we navigate sickness, school dramas and more.  A quiet start to the year which enabled a trip through Uruguay followed by a manic summer period of intense work (more on that below). A good reminder to trust the process and embrace both the quiet times and the busy times.  A steady evolution in the size of clients, seniority of the work and confidence in my model.  I started working with a professional coach at the start of the year and have had a very rewarding experience and it’s nice to feel like I can justify an accountability partner, mentor and cheerleader!  Started and paused The Malcontents, a podcast with my buddy Sean Blanda. I found the process of recording a podcast super rewarding but as a side project for both of us it’s been tough to prioritize and focus on. I’m convinced some form of podcasting will return for me but not sure exactly what format yet…Peaks and ValleysWhen I was first starting out on my own my friend Dave Dawson said you have to embrace the quiet times and the busy times. Work nights and weekends when you have to, but make sure you go biking 11am on a Tuesday too when you can. You have to embrace the whole lifestyle to get the benefit.This has been more true than ever this year - this is four years of consulting work (with each color being a different client):You can see the quiet start to the year and then the frenzy over the summer! And if you squint enough you can make out the cycles of work coming through:Some thoughts looking at this graph:If you go all the way back to the beginning of the journey the first 9 months were pretty bumpy and sporadic until I hit two stable retained clients at the same time. One of those lasted two years and the other I’m still working with today(!).That retained revenue is the secret to so much. In my mind it’s the key to doing interesting work and to creating a sustainable business. I’ve got more to write about how I focus on retained revenue and how I end up working with clients for years at a time but I teased it in my strategy and stewardship post:  For a long time I resisted the execution and project management of my strategy work with clients. I felt like if I got caught up in the weeds I was going to be doing work that wasn’t as interesting and wasn’t as well paid as the strategy work.  But the truth is this - strategy that lives in docs and presentations is worthless. And businesses live and die by the momentum of projects. So helping clients at critical points to move the chains forward - often in incredibly tactical ways, but always within the wider strategic framework - is deeply valuable.  In month 1 I’m always doing strategy. In month 6 I’m often overseeing specific pieces of content production. Then back again into strategy in month 9 as we review and check in.At the start of this year with a few projects wrapping up I had a quiet period and then two meaty projects over the summer nearly crushed me. Thankfully I’d shored up emotional and psychological strength in January to hunker down and lean into the busy period.And finally, note how slow I am right now. For the first time since June 2016 I’m at a lull. It feels nice to be cruising out of the city with the windows down and the music playing finally free again! We’ll see how long before the deamons appear nibbling at my heels demanding revenue.Tending to my NetworksMy network is the most valuable part of my business and I have continued to invest and cultivate new friends, new faces and new connections. There’s a semi-regular dinner series that I host with an amazing group. There’s regular coffee meetings. Writing and creating new connections.Building a network of peers - weirdos and misfits like myself who are trying to figure out their own path through the world has been not only rewarding but also deeply valuable. All of my leads come via my network so I see this as a deliberate activity to grow my consulting business but also a necessary task to ensure that I have a support network should I need it (and to provide a support network to others!).This network has provided some sense of stability to this independence. And some social interaction :)I’ve also been slowly and steadily growing my tinyletter audience. As this grows I anticipate that this will become an increasingly interesting part of my intimate network - sharing thoughts there feels very different from blogging so it’s fun to flex a different type of writing there.PositioningThere’s a lot of angst around positioning. I think many independents struggle with it - I’ve struggled with it! But I’m starting to find some peace here. I realized that the game of positioning is not an external game - it’s not so much about the face you present to the market as much as it’s the story you tell yourself internally!This realization has helped me better understand what it is I’m chasing (a stable identity!) and also to understand that it’s never going to fully materialize.Looking back my previous attempt at positioning isn’t wrong per se but it’s perhaps overly… simplistic? generic?This is from last year:For content companies looking to invest in growth I’m the secret weapon embedded in your organization to build &amp; lead strategic initiatives.Earlier this year I uncovered (invented?) the concept of Media Design. I took a stab a definition as follows:Media Design is the practice of designing effective systems of content within the overlapping ecosystems of technology, distribution, production and experience.With the uncovering of media design earlier this year my positioning and narrative is basically I do strategic media design work through strategy and stewardship.This is a less concise framing but I think adds some more nuance to the kind of work I do and feels like it rings true.Some example client work from this past year:  Put together a high level content vision for a business that creates content at significant scale across 20+ websites and many international markets. A mixture of strategy to decide the right thing invest in and people to understand how they might adapt to the vision to get it done. Fun stuff.  Led audience development for a digital magazine that had very little digital infrastructure, supporting them through a large transition period as they were spun out of a holding company to be independent which included a complete digital re-platforming and building a new audience development team internally  Supported a media company you’ve definitely heard of as they went the other way and were acquired by an umbrella brand. A fascinating merging of cultures. This was an interesting project where the strategy was relatively modest but required a ton of process work to help them do new things in new ways between two teams that had different cultures.As an aside - I’m finding writing case studies to be challenging. Who’s story is it to tell when you’re so deeply embedded in a client’s organization that you’re essentially just one of the team? Something to chew on.Writing2018 has been a great year for writing! Tons of blogging that I’m proud of. Some of my personal faves from the past year:  small b blogging  strategy &amp; stewardship  high fidelity consulting  the practice of media design  the power of labelsBut blogging is only the surface… I’m starting to think about writing a book. It’ll be something like a manual for other independent consultants - based off my writing around the consultant’s grain and a fieldguide for independent consultants and attempting to thread the needle between theory and practice.I have an outline for the book and my plan right now is to blog most of it - getting the heart of the writing out on my blog over the next year or so to build up a body of work that I can hire an editor to partner with and dress up into a book.Writing longer form is hard though! It feels very much like learning a new skill. But I’m excited about the challenge and while client work is slow it’s good to have a project to keep me productive and engaged. I’ve got the first longer piece of writing coming out in the next week or so that’s deliberately designed to fit into a book-like object so I’m excited to do more of that kind of writing and to get better at it.The Year AheadSo what next?I’m floating in this funny space - I trust the process now more than I ever have and I feel confident more work will come along. But at the same time what that work will look like is a mystery right now!The road ahead is open. The windows are down. The mixtape is on. So far so good. Onwards where the road will take me.–Much love and thank you to everyone who’s supported me on this journey so far. There are too many to list here but I love you all."

You have to embrace the whole lifestyle to get the benefit.This has been more true than ever this year - this is four years of consulting work (with each color being a different client):You can see the quiet start to the year and then the frenzy over the summer! And if you squint enough you can make out the cycles of work coming through:Some thoughts looking at this graph:If you go all the way back to the beginning of the journey the first 9 months were pretty bumpy and sporadic until I hit two stable retained clients at the same time. One of those lasted two years and the other I’m still working with today(!).That retained revenue is the secret to so much. In my mind it’s the key to doing interesting work and to creating a sustainable business. I’ve got more to write about how I focus on retained revenue and how I end up working with clients for years at a time but I teased it in my strategy and stewardship post:  For a long time I resisted the execution and project management of my strategy work with clients. I felt like if I got caught up in the weeds I was going to be doing work that wasn’t as interesting and wasn’t as well paid as the strategy work.  But the truth is this - strategy that lives in docs and presentations is worthless. And businesses live and die by the momentum of projects. So helping clients at critical points to move the chains forward - often in incredibly tactical ways, but always within the wider strategic framework - is deeply valuable.  In month 1 I’m always doing strategy. In month 6 I’m often overseeing specific pieces of content production. Then back again into strategy in month 9 as we review and check in.At the start of this year with a few projects wrapping up I had a quiet period and then two meaty projects over the summer nearly crushed me. Thankfully I’d shored up emotional and psychological strength in January to hunker down and lean into the busy period.And finally, note how slow I am right now. For the first time since June 2016 I’m at a lull. It feels nice to be cruising out of the city with the windows down and the music playing finally free again! We’ll see how long before the deamons appear nibbling at my heels demanding revenue.Tending to my NetworksMy network is the most valuable part of my business and I have continued to invest and cultivate new friends, new faces and new connections. There’s a semi-regular dinner series that I host with an amazing group. There’s regular coffee meetings. Writing and creating new connections.Building a network of peers - weirdos and misfits like myself who are trying to figure out their own path through the world has been not only rewarding but also deeply valuable. All of my leads come via my network so I see this as a deliberate activity to grow my consulting business but also a necessary task to ensure that I have a support network should I need it (and to provide a support network to others!).This network has provided some sense of stability to this independence. And some social interaction :)I’ve also been slowly and steadily growing my tinyletter audience. As this grows I anticipate that this will become an increasingly interesting part of my intimate network - sharing thoughts there feels very different from blogging so it’s fun to flex a different type of writing there.PositioningThere’s a lot of angst around positioning. I think many independents struggle with it - I’ve struggled with it! But I’m starting to find some peace here. I realized that the game of positioning is not an external game - it’s not so much about the face you present to the market as much as it’s the story you tell yourself internally!This realization has helped me better understand what it is I’m chasing (a stable identity!) and also to understand that it’s never going to fully materialize.Looking back my previous attempt at positioning isn’t wrong per se but it’s perhaps overly… simplistic? generic?This is from last year:For content companies looking to invest in growth I’m the secret weapon embedded in your organization to build &amp; lead strategic initiatives.Earlier this year I uncovered (invented?) the concept of Media Design. I took a stab a definition as follows:Media Design is the practice of designing effective systems of content within the overlapping ecosystems of technology, distribution, production and experience.With the uncovering of media design earlier this year my positioning and narrative is basically I do strategic media design work through strategy and stewardship.This is a less concise framing but I think adds some more nuance to the kind of work I do and feels like it rings true.Some example client work from this past year:  Put together a high level content vision for a business that creates content at significant scale across 20+ websites and many international markets. A mixture of strategy to decide the right thing invest in and people to understand how they might adapt to the vision to get it done. Fun stuff.  Led audience development for a digital magazine that had very little digital infrastructure, supporting them through a large transition period as they were spun out of a holding company to be independent which included a complete digital re-platforming and building a new audience development team internally  Supported a media company you’ve definitely heard of as they went the other way and were acquired by an umbrella brand. A fascinating merging of cultures. This was an interesting project where the strategy was relatively modest but required a ton of process work to help them do new things in new ways between two teams that had different cultures.As an aside - I’m finding writing case studies to be challenging. Who’s story is it to tell when you’re so deeply embedded in a client’s organization that you’re essentially just one of the team? Something to chew on.Writing2018 has been a great year for writing! Tons of blogging that I’m proud of. Some of my personal faves from the past year:  small b blogging  strategy &amp; stewardship  high fidelity consulting  the practice of media design  the power of labelsBut blogging is only the surface… I’m starting to think about writing a book. It’ll be something like a manual for other independent consultants - based off my writing around the consultant’s grain and a fieldguide for independent consultants and attempting to thread the needle between theory and practice.I have an outline for the book and my plan right now is to blog most of it - getting the heart of the writing out on my blog over the next year or so to build up a body of work that I can hire an editor to partner with and dress up into a book.Writing longer form is hard though! It feels very much like learning a new skill. But I’m excited about the challenge and while client work is slow it’s good to have a project to keep me productive and engaged. I’ve got the first longer piece of writing coming out in the next week or so that’s deliberately designed to fit into a book-like object so I’m excited to do more of that kind of writing and to get better at it.The Year AheadSo what next?I’m floating in this funny space - I trust the process now more than I ever have and I feel confident more work will come along. But at the same time what that work will look like is a mystery right now!The road ahead is open. The windows are down. The mixtape is on. So far so good. Onwards where the road will take me.–Much love and thank you to everyone who’s supported me on this journey so far. There are too many to list here but I love you all."

Loosely speaking - streams are for fast twitch thinking and acting. Participating in the stream is a fast feedback loop, with a slightly longer undercurrent of connection building.As I was reading this thread by Venkatesh I was struck by the similarity to the ideas and concepts in a piece I also read recently (though it’s from 2015) - the garden and the stream, a technopastoral.This piece from Mike Caulfield takes a very similar look at the time horizons of information, but with an inward lens. How do we build and maintain our own personal information gardens? Not streams - but environments we can tend and grow over decades:  The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.  Things in the Garden don’t collapse to a single set of relations or canonical sequence, and that’s part of what we mean when we say “the web as topology” or the “web as space”. Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships  […]  In the Garden, to ask what happened first is trivial at best. The question “Did the bridge come after these trees” in a well-designed garden is meaningless historical trivia. The bridge doesn’t reply to the trees or the trees to the bridge. They are related to one another in a relatively timeless way.  This is true of everything in the garden. Each flower, tree, and vine is seen in relation to the whole by the gardener so that the visitors can have unique yet coherent experiences as they find their own paths through the garden. We create the garden as a sort of experience generator, capable of infinite expression and meaning.The Garden - vs the Stream:  In the stream metaphor you don’t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by.  It’s not that you are passive in the Stream. You can be active. But your actions in there — your blog posts, @ mentions, forum comments — exist in a context that is collapsed down to a simple timeline of events that together form a narrative.  In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.Both links take some work to finish but I can’t encourage you to read them enough.Stream, Campfires and GardensSo as I’m reading these pieces it strikes me that I consume &amp; produce information as follows:Streams - mostly Twitter for me, this is where fast twitch information discovery happens. The firehose of content. But with an undercurrent of creating new connections. While I’m slightly over-consuming here I can’t kick the habit because of so many incredible connections that have come from it.Campfires - mostly blogging for me, though I know some folks gather around private slack groups too. My blog functions as a digital campfire (or a series of campfires) that are slower burn but fade relatively quickly over the timeframe of years. Connection forming, thinking out loud, self referencing and connection forming. This builds muscle, helps me articulate my thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people and more.

Where is the tool to curate, connect and explore information? Where is my personal learning curriculum? This decades-spanning project of information sensemaking is missing for me but seems appealing. Are.na, Pinboard, Evernote and Pocket all fill some portion of this gap for me but none of them are building a garden I can maintain…Michael’s piece was written in 2015 and references heavily the idea of federated wikis and I’m curious to hear where his thinking went with it.How do you manage information flows?

Everywhere I’ve been all over the world is logged in some form on Google maps. This is what Manhattan and the globe looks like:I’m interested in maps as collaborative, community memory places.Further reading: in the map room - which is a fascinating community / art project by Jer Thorp around projecting city maps onto pieces of paper and having different community groups draw, doodle, annotate and highlight the maps. The things that are unearthed this way are super interesting.Pop-ups and governanceOver the past 4/5 years Erin and I have hosted a number of pop-up art shows. Some in formal gallery spaces but more often they’ve been in abandoned retail / commercial spaces (e.g. this one) - re-purposed for a period of time to host an art show.The ability to do this basically all comes down to Erin’s hustle and wrangling. We grab some insurance, tell everyone to be careful and then hope that nothing goes wrong. But there’s so much abdondoned real estate - and so many potential creative uses for them. I’m interested in how urban spaces can be re-used, borrowed and more.I’m reading dark matter and trojan horses by Dan Hill right now where he talks about Helsinki Street Eats as a small project that allows for experimentation in governance and law.Further reading: Restaurant Day, edible urbanism and civic opportunism &amp; helsinki street eats [PDF]Visualizations and dataData viz as it’s come to be called does appeal to me and I’m interested in it but I’m more interested in the meaning and opportunity behind mapping data. There’s more geo-located data being produced than ever before and we’re only scratching the surface on what’s possible, knowable and more.I played around with this a while back - back when Instagram’s API was more open I had a copy of 30k photos posted over a few weeks all geo-located less than 400 yards from my home. This glimpse not into the personal feed but the “master firehose” of data is one we don’t typically get to look at.So the technical nuts and bolts of geolocation, maps, technology and feeds is interesting to me.Further reading: Mills Field – a weblog from SFO Museum - a blog by Aaron Cope, one of the most interesting people I have ever met. His ability to cut across the real nuts and bolts of the technology while keeping an eye on wider cultural and societal implications is incredible. It’s a little dense at times (because he really gets into it!) but so worth checking out. This piece for example all about maps and map tiles at SFO museum.–So here we are - I’m going to do my best to follow along with the course as a satellite blogger. I’ve provisionally blocked off “Maps Mondays” for myself to read, explore and post. I’m a few weeks behind the course but hopefully I can catch up.If you want to join - come along for the ride!"

We grab some insurance, tell everyone to be careful and then hope that nothing goes wrong. But there’s so much abdondoned real estate - and so many potential creative uses for them. I’m interested in how urban spaces can be re-used, borrowed and more.I’m reading dark matter and trojan horses by Dan Hill right now where he talks about Helsinki Street Eats as a small project that allows for experimentation in governance and law.Further reading: Restaurant Day, edible urbanism and civic opportunism &amp; helsinki street eats [PDF]Visualizations and dataData viz as it’s come to be called does appeal to me and I’m interested in it but I’m more interested in the meaning and opportunity behind mapping data. There’s more geo-located data being produced than ever before and we’re only scratching the surface on what’s possible, knowable and more.I played around with this a while back - back when Instagram’s API was more open I had a copy of 30k photos posted over a few weeks all geo-located less than 400 yards from my home. This glimpse not into the personal feed but the “master firehose” of data is one we don’t typically get to look at.So the technical nuts and bolts of geolocation, maps, technology and feeds is interesting to me.Further reading: Mills Field – a weblog from SFO Museum - a blog by Aaron Cope, one of the most interesting people I have ever met. His ability to cut across the real nuts and bolts of the technology while keeping an eye on wider cultural and societal implications is incredible. It’s a little dense at times (because he really gets into it!) but so worth checking out. This piece for example all about maps and map tiles at SFO museum.–So here we are - I’m going to do my best to follow along with the course as a satellite blogger. I’ve provisionally blocked off “Maps Mondays” for myself to read, explore and post. I’m a few weeks behind the course but hopefully I can catch up.If you want to join - come along for the ride!"

I tried my hand at a very simple illustration. Imagine if Mozilla launched Slab2 - an entry level for-the-record blogging system with in-built hosting, polished UI and the ability to grow out of the platform.I believe this project would be in-line with the Mozilla manifesto:  Principle 1 - The internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.  Principle 3 - The internet must enrich the lives of individual human beings.  Principle 5 - Individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it.  Principle 6 - The effectiveness of the internet as a public resource depends upon […] decentralized participation worldwide.(Btw part of this idea grew from reading about some recent initiatives Mozilla took into publishing on the web.

This is not easy. Things like in-line editing. Syncing between devices. Copy and paste handling. Default formatting. These things would be key. Thankfully there are some good examples to follow here - Medium, Ghost, WP Gutenberg etc.Markdown &amp; interoperability - One of the things I love about Github pages and markdown is that by default I publish in triplicate. My workflow by design stores a copy of my blog on my local machine, on github and on the web. And not only that but every blog post is stored as a simple markdown file. Easy enough for anyone to read even if you don’t know all the specifics of Markdown.I have a vision for Slab by Mozilla to actually be two tools in one. A CMS for hosting, editing and maintaining markdown files AND a hosting service for publishing these as blogs. I think you could even run this whole thing on Jekyll under the hood (with a few pieces abstracted away for beginner users. Imagine a tool like Siteleaf that managed to create a beautiful CMS while also keeping the underlying files readable! Magic.This simple concept is powerful. And ultimately would allow for an incredibly portable file format. Exporting your site from Slab to your own Jekyll instance or to Wordpress would be simple. While this would add a little complexity to the design of the product on the back end it is central to the Mozilla manifesto “The effectiveness of the internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content)”.Pocket integration - You’d want some opt-out but integration with Pocket achieves two big things - it builds in a distribution network and it fits Slab into the Mozilla ecosystem. You can’t ignore the in built network effects of Medium and it would be critical to build this to ensure people actually switched from Medium to Slab3. Support for sharing and reading content either on the web or inside Pocket. Maybe even enabling Pocket analytics by default on every site? I think you could implement a handful of small nudges that would align these two products nicely.Talk integration? - It’s a little much to expect this project to single handedly solve all of the ills of the indie web but Mozilla already has Talk from the Coral Project which aims to solve commenting. Some form of integration here would make perfect sense and disqus is on life support at this point (and owned by an adtech company which makes me nervous).Why this makes sense for MozillaAbove and beyond the support and service of the core mission I believe this would be a smart bet for Mozilla - driving support of firefox login (on desktop and mobile!) and integrating perfectly with Pocket.What do you think?

  "date": "September 6, 2018",
  "content": "The tappable web is an interesting place. These days discussion of tappable stories is dominated by Instagram. The Instagram stories format is, perhaps, the fastest growing media format of all time.There are a handful of other story formats floating around. For example:  Twitter moments (example)  Instagram stories (example)  Giphy stories (example)  Medium series (example) (ironically these are user-hostile on mobile, forcing you to read them on desktop or in the native app….)In my mind, this whole genre started with Fish: a Tap Essay from Robin Sloan. And it recently got re-mastered! I strongly encourage you to check it out: https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/.AMP StoriesTo date, none of the tappable story implementations have worked well on the web but the closest is AMP stories. Until recently they were highly experimental and you had to get your domain whitelisted by Google to try them. But AMP stories just reached V1.0 and is now available for everyone.So I thought I’d play around!I should say before I go further that I do have some reservations about AMP. Namely:  I’m wary of AMP generally. I think the end result of AMP speeding up the web is a GOOD THING, but the centralization and move away from the open web is troubling.  AMP stories are still kind of clunky. There’s no swiping to advance. They’re just not as performant or smooth as native Instagram stories.  Google’s mishandling of cache problems and URL linking demonstrates a poor understanding of the web.But, I like the way I can host story-format content on my own domain. So let’s play around and have some fun!How do you build a CMS for tappable stories?As I began thinking about making AMP stories and building some kind of generator for them I began to study the “CMS” of Instagram stories and marvelled both at the depth and complexity of it and how much is hidden beneath the surface. It’s an incredibly powerful platform that generates a huge array of types of stories without feeling burdensome.For those that want a little more theory and noodling on web-based stories you should definitely check out Stephanie and Bryan Rieger’s explorations building hopscotch with Mozilla:Rethinking the creative web: Our journey to reimagine ‘web publishing’ for the social webAnd for a more code-focused approach the team at Mic developed an open format called story-json that is designed to allow content to exist across multiple “story” platforms. I don’t think it’s actively maintained but it’s an interesting attempt at abstraction:Introducing a cross-platform format for tap-through storiesIn short - I have no idea how you’d go about building a web-based CMS to generate stories to the level of creativity you can get with Instagram stories but I’m sure someone will figure it out.For me, I decided to build a bare bones generator that I could extend and play with…Copy my code github!Warning - there be dragons ahead! Badly coded dragons… I’m not a developer or a designer so you’ll see this whole thing is a little rough around the edges.This blog is hosted on Github pages using the Jekyll framework. It’s a markdown heavy format but allows for liquid templating and while I thought about generating AMP stories using content blocks I decided using the frontmatter was a simpler approach.So first I created an ampstory.html layout file:View the file on GithubAnd then everything is done in the front matter of a story file like this:View a sample story file hereHow to use this to make AMP storiesThe way I’ve set it up - if you copy my layouts they work as follows:The cover takes the following fields:  “title:” which is the main story title  “subtitle:” which is the subtitle  “background:” which takes an image URL and makes a full screen background imageThen every page object works like this:  “Layout: thirds” divides the page into three horizontal rows of equal height to place HTML inside.  “Layout: vertical” allows for “stacking” of content but it’s not very sophisticated. Right now I’ve set it up to have a top, image and bottom defined with the image taking up most of the page and full width. It’s crude but allows for in-line images.  “background” takes an image URL and makes a full screen image background for the page  “cta” takes two children, link and text which go to the link URL and the anchor text  “textcolor:” which allows you to change the text color on the page to something other than default white  “backgroundblur:” when set to true it adds a filter:blur(2px) brightnesss(90%) to the background imageTwo important notes for furthering creativity: the frontmatter supports emojis 🔥 and amp stories support gifs.You’ll see that this is all pretty crude and easily extensible. For more of an idea of what is possible take a look at CNN’s AMP stories.Alternatively - I also made a super simple format that just takes a single input - a folder path. Then it generates an AMP story from all the images in that folder. See an example file here.Here’s a few example stories I made:So! With all of that out of the way - what have I been playing around with? Here’s a few fun little stories I’ve been using to test out the functionality:Amazing Space Colony Art from the 1970s - this story is based on an article I read about this amazing space colony art that NASA commissioned in the 70s. Perfect space-gaping images for AMP stories.Why you should read the left hand of darkness by Ursula K Leguin - I recently finished this book and thought book covers make for interesting AMP story content.Hoop loops - fun basketball gifs - you can use gifs in AMP stories!And if you want to peek under the hood you can see all of the raw files on github here.Where next?In summary - I think AMP stories have a long way to go before they feel anywhere near as fluid and fun as Instagram stories. The layout is more restrictive and there are lots of small interactions that just don’t work as well (little things like tap delays, no swiping, animations etc).One feature that is especially clunky right now is adding links. But I’m excited that as of two weeks ago this project is being worked on to function much more like Instagram stories with a double-tap UI: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/16521.It’s still fun to be able to play around with this new kind of format on my own domain. And I’m excited for where things go next.If you make anything from this code @ me on twitter (@tomcritchlow) or leave a comment below!–Update (9/17) - the BBC Labs posted a quick article with some thoughts about using and building AMP stories here: https://medium.com/bbc-news-labs/experiments-with-amps-new-stories-format-3a2a1103cee. It includes this wild image showing their CMS. Love it."

For example:  Twitter moments (example)  Instagram stories (example)  Giphy stories (example)  Medium series (example) (ironically these are user-hostile on mobile, forcing you to read them on desktop or in the native app….)In my mind, this whole genre started with Fish: a Tap Essay from Robin Sloan. And it recently got re-mastered! I strongly encourage you to check it out: https://www.robinsloan.com/fish/.AMP StoriesTo date, none of the tappable story implementations have worked well on the web but the closest is AMP stories. Until recently they were highly experimental and you had to get your domain whitelisted by Google to try them. But AMP stories just reached V1.0 and is now available for everyone.So I thought I’d play around!I should say before I go further that I do have some reservations about AMP. Namely:  I’m wary of AMP generally. I think the end result of AMP speeding up the web is a GOOD THING, but the centralization and move away from the open web is troubling.  AMP stories are still kind of clunky. There’s no swiping to advance. They’re just not as performant or smooth as native Instagram stories.  Google’s mishandling of cache problems and URL linking demonstrates a poor understanding of the web.But, I like the way I can host story-format content on my own domain. So let’s play around and have some fun!How do you build a CMS for tappable stories?As I began thinking about making AMP stories and building some kind of generator for them I began to study the “CMS” of Instagram stories and marvelled both at the depth and complexity of it and how much is hidden beneath the surface. It’s an incredibly powerful platform that generates a huge array of types of stories without feeling burdensome.For those that want a little more theory and noodling on web-based stories you should definitely check out Stephanie and Bryan Rieger’s explorations building hopscotch with Mozilla:Rethinking the creative web: Our journey to reimagine ‘web publishing’ for the social webAnd for a more code-focused approach the team at Mic developed an open format called story-json that is designed to allow content to exist across multiple “story” platforms. I don’t think it’s actively maintained but it’s an interesting attempt at abstraction:Introducing a cross-platform format for tap-through storiesIn short - I have no idea how you’d go about building a web-based CMS to generate stories to the level of creativity you can get with Instagram stories but I’m sure someone will figure it out.For me, I decided to build a bare bones generator that I could extend and play with…Copy my code github!Warning - there be dragons ahead! Badly coded dragons… I’m not a developer or a designer so you’ll see this whole thing is a little rough around the edges.This blog is hosted on Github pages using the Jekyll framework. It’s a markdown heavy format but allows for liquid templating and while I thought about generating AMP stories using content blocks I decided using the frontmatter was a simpler approach.So first I created an ampstory.html layout file:View the file on GithubAnd then everything is done in the front matter of a story file like this:View a sample story file hereHow to use this to make AMP storiesThe way I’ve set it up - if you copy my layouts they work as follows:The cover takes the following fields:  “title:” which is the main story title  “subtitle:” which is the subtitle  “background:” which takes an image URL and makes a full screen background imageThen every page object works like this:  “Layout: thirds” divides the page into three horizontal rows of equal height to place HTML inside.  “Layout: vertical” allows for “stacking” of content but it’s not very sophisticated. Right now I’ve set it up to have a top, image and bottom defined with the image taking up most of the page and full width. It’s crude but allows for in-line images.  “background” takes an image URL and makes a full screen image background for the page  “cta” takes two children, link and text which go to the link URL and the anchor text  “textcolor:” which allows you to change the text color on the page to something other than default white  “backgroundblur:” when set to true it adds a filter:blur(2px) brightnesss(90%) to the background imageTwo important notes for furthering creativity: the frontmatter supports emojis 🔥 and amp stories support gifs.You’ll see that this is all pretty crude and easily extensible. For more of an idea of what is possible take a look at CNN’s AMP stories.Alternatively - I also made a super simple format that just takes a single input - a folder path. Then it generates an AMP story from all the images in that folder. See an example file here.Here’s a few example stories I made:So! With all of that out of the way - what have I been playing around with? Here’s a few fun little stories I’ve been using to test out the functionality:Amazing Space Colony Art from the 1970s - this story is based on an article I read about this amazing space colony art that NASA commissioned in the 70s. Perfect space-gaping images for AMP stories.Why you should read the left hand of darkness by Ursula K Leguin - I recently finished this book and thought book covers make for interesting AMP story content.Hoop loops - fun basketball gifs - you can use gifs in AMP stories!And if you want to peek under the hood you can see all of the raw files on github here.Where next?In summary - I think AMP stories have a long way to go before they feel anywhere near as fluid and fun as Instagram stories. The layout is more restrictive and there are lots of small interactions that just don’t work as well (little things like tap delays, no swiping, animations etc).One feature that is especially clunky right now is adding links. But I’m excited that as of two weeks ago this project is being worked on to function much more like Instagram stories with a double-tap UI: https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/16521.It’s still fun to be able to play around with this new kind of format on my own domain. And I’m excited for where things go next.If you make anything from this code @ me on twitter (@tomcritchlow) or leave a comment below!–Update (9/17) - the BBC Labs posted a quick article with some thoughts about using and building AMP stories here: https://medium.com/bbc-news-labs/experiments-with-amps-new-stories-format-3a2a1103cee. It includes this wild image showing their CMS. Love it."

  "title": "Strategy and stewardship",

  "date": "June 28, 2018",
  "content": "The problem with strategy work is that it’s often a sprint. A short burst of work, done periodically to set the vision and the strategy. If you enjoy strategy work, are you doomed to chase short term strategy sprints?And, by the way, who’s ensuring that the execution of the strategy is in line with the vision?While building my consulting practice over the past 3.5 years I’ve accidentally stumbled on a way to be involved in strategy work and then stick around for the long term execution (in fact when I looked it up recently I see that my average client retention for retainers is 20 months). I believe this is good for my clients and good for my consulting practice. They get more than just powerpoints and I get retained revenue. Everyone wins.It all comes down to the concept of strategy and stewardship, which I’ve been unwittingly adhering to for a long time but when I saw it articulated recently by the Helsinki Design Lab it really made something click.Page 40 of Recipes for Systemic Change by the Helsinki Design Lab:  Without the broader stewardship arc, the design process is easily all about thinking and not doing — this is precisely what we see to be the difficulty with the ‘design thinking’ debate and its over-emphasis on helping people think differently. In the context of strategic design, ideas are important, but only when they lead to impact. Part of this is appreciating the quality with which an idea is executed and recognizing that quality of execution and quality of strategy are equally important. It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop.So, strategy without execution doesn’t work. But the people that do strategy don’t typically get involved in execution. The answer? Strategy and stewardship.Page 15 of Legible Practises by the Helsinki Design Lab:  We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural stewardStrategy and stewardship. Yes. On the money.How this plays out in my own workFor a long time I resisted the execution and project management of my strategy work with clients. I felt like if I got caught up in the weeds I was going to be doing work that wasn’t as interesting and wasn’t as well paid as the strategy work.But the truth is this - strategy that lives in docs and presentations is worthless. And businesses live and die by the momentum of projects.

  "content": "The problem with strategy work is that it’s often a sprint. A short burst of work, done periodically to set the vision and the strategy. If you enjoy strategy work, are you doomed to chase short term strategy sprints?And, by the way, who’s ensuring that the execution of the strategy is in line with the vision?While building my consulting practice over the past 3.5 years I’ve accidentally stumbled on a way to be involved in strategy work and then stick around for the long term execution (in fact when I looked it up recently I see that my average client retention for retainers is 20 months). I believe this is good for my clients and good for my consulting practice. They get more than just powerpoints and I get retained revenue. Everyone wins.It all comes down to the concept of strategy and stewardship, which I’ve been unwittingly adhering to for a long time but when I saw it articulated recently by the Helsinki Design Lab it really made something click.Page 40 of Recipes for Systemic Change by the Helsinki Design Lab:  Without the broader stewardship arc, the design process is easily all about thinking and not doing — this is precisely what we see to be the difficulty with the ‘design thinking’ debate and its over-emphasis on helping people think differently. In the context of strategic design, ideas are important, but only when they lead to impact. Part of this is appreciating the quality with which an idea is executed and recognizing that quality of execution and quality of strategy are equally important. It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop.So, strategy without execution doesn’t work. But the people that do strategy don’t typically get involved in execution. The answer? Strategy and stewardship.Page 15 of Legible Practises by the Helsinki Design Lab:  We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural stewardStrategy and stewardship. Yes. On the money.How this plays out in my own workFor a long time I resisted the execution and project management of my strategy work with clients. I felt like if I got caught up in the weeds I was going to be doing work that wasn’t as interesting and wasn’t as well paid as the strategy work.But the truth is this - strategy that lives in docs and presentations is worthless. And businesses live and die by the momentum of projects. So helping clients at critical points to move the chains forward - often in incredibly tactical ways, but always within the wider strategic framework - is deeply valuable.In month 1 I’m always doing strategy. In month 6 I’m often overseeing specific pieces of content production. Then back again into strategy in month 9 as we review and check in.My advice for other independents looking to set up a consulting practice is think carefully about which kinds of projects you can be involved in for both strategy and stewardship.

  "content": "There’s an idea that starting a blog is harder than it used to be. That there used to be a way to write a few words, slap it online and wait for the traffic to roll in.I call BS. It’s not that it’s not true exactly - but that kind of thinking is living in the shadow of the Digg homepage.I’d like to propose a new mental model for blogging - small b blogging. Let me show you what I mean.Middle of last year I wrote one of my most widely read blog posts - the consultant’s grain. Checking analytics I see that it has 2500 lifetime pageviews. It’s not nothing but as one of my “biggest” posts it’s a small audience by anyone’s measure.And yet. That single post has directly led to two podcast appearances, at least one client, several coffee meetings with other independent consultants and more interesting conversations than I can remember.This post - f* yeah side projects - has 1,614 lifetime pageviews. But was included in two email newsletters from people I respect, created at least one interesting coffee meeting and, perhaps most importantly, is a story I re-tell often and use as a fable for folks asking for career and interview advice.What’s going on here? I call it small b blogging. It’s a virtuous cycle of making interesting connections while also being a way to clarify and strengthen my own ideas. I’m not reaching a big audience by any measure but the direct impact and benefit is material.Small b blogging is learning to write and think with the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most “content marketing”.And remember that you are your own audience! Small b blogging is writing things that you link back to and reference time and time again. Ideas that can evolve and grow as your thinking and audience grows.As Venkatesh says in the calculus of grit - release work often, reference your own thinking &amp; rework the same ideas again and again. That’s the small b blogging model.Blogging isn’t dead but the network topology has changedHow does small b blogging go against the traditional mental model of blogging?Digg used to be the homepage of the internet (back when it was an aggregator, and before reddit became the new Digg). This was a time when there were a small number of entry points to the network that controlled a huge amount of influence. The Digg homepage, Hacker News, Slashdot, Metafilter. Crucially, these entry points to the network were very big and very accessible. What do I mean by that? Well - in those early days they were very big in the sense that if you got your content on the Digg homepage a lot of people would see it (relative to the total size of the network at the time). And they were very accessible in the sense that it wasn’t that hard to get your content there! I recall having a bunch of Digg homepage hits and Hacker News homepage hits.But - as the overall network has grown exponentially the network topology has changed. Digg, Reddit, Hacker News etc all still exist but the audience you can reach with a “homepage” hit there has become much smaller relative to the overall size of the network. And getting a homepage hit there is harder than ever because the volume of content has increased exponentially.This causes the curious effect of people thinking it’s harder than ever to reach an audience online. “It’s not like it used to be”.But! As the network grows and these large entry points to the network shrink in relative power, new entry points emerge - new ways to reach clusters of audience faster than ever before.Want to reach an audience of marketers online? Hacker News used to be your best bet (despite the fact that it’s mostly engineers and startup junkies). Now you have inbound.org, growthhackers.net, Moz has a widely read newsletter, etc etc etc.And many of these networks don’t rely on a common “homepage” format. Are.na for example has many networks overlapping design, design criticism, product design, content, art and more. Like the digital equivalent of zines these networks are almost intentionally small and don’t have aggregated entryways. But the audience there is large enough to create meaningful connections and audience for your work if you’re willing to spend the time.Every community now has a fragmented number of communities, homepages, entry points, tinyletters, influencers and networks. They overlap in weird and wonderful ways - and it means that it’s harder than ever to feel like you got a “homepage” success on these networks. To create a moment that has the whole audience looking at the same thing at the same time.Of course, the natural consequence of these fragmented audiences is that getting some traction with one or more of these smaller entry points is easier than it ever was.So, getting a post read by “everyone” is harder than ever but reaching hundreds or low thousands of audience has never been easier.The promise of audience is big B bloggingSo what is big B blogging? I’d contend that too much of what you read on the web is written for large audiences. Too much content on the web is designed for scale, for sharing, for gloss and finish. It’s mass media, whether it’s made by a media company or an individual acting like one. So when people think of blogging their natural reference point is create something that looks like the mass media they’re consuming. Content designed for pageviews and scale.This is why it’s appealing to people writing on the web to get it in a prestigious publication, or place it somewhere with an in-built audience. i.e. Medium, Inc, Entrepreneur, Fast Company etc.It’s so alluring to want to write something there because you’ll get more page views than if you put it on your own site and you’ll get the prestige of saying you were published in Fast Company (or, or, etc).But what is lost by following big B blogging? By chasing audience we lose the ability to be ourselves. By writing for everyone we write for no one. Too often I read things otherwise smart people have written for places like Fast Company and my eyes glaze over. Personal identity is necessarily watered down. Yes those places have large audiences but they’re shallow audiences. They don’t care about you at all. Your writing washes through their feeds like water.Instead - I think most people would be better served by subscribing to small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are addressable (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and archived (i.e. you have a list of things you’ve written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and memorable (i.e. has your own design, logo or style). Writing that can live and breathe in small networks. Scale be damned.When you write for someone else’s publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.Go forth and small b blogSo I challenge you to think clearly about the many disparate networks you’re part of and think about the ideas you might want to offer those networks that you don’t want to get lost in the feed. Ideas you might want to return to. Think about how writing with and for the network might enable you to start blogging. Forget the big B blogging model. Forget Medium’s promise of page views and claps. Forget the guest post on Inc, Forbes and Entrepreneur. Forget Fast Company. Forget fast content.Come join the network. Bring a blog.Deep thanks to the many folks who read an early draft of this post and gave feedback including Brian Dell, Mark Johnstone, Paul Millerd, Toby Shorin, Brendan Schlagel &amp; Dan Leatherman"

  "content": "I often talk about blogging as “networked writing”. For me, it’s the key difference between other forms of writing and blogging. The idea that blogs exist within the network is crucial to understanding the medium (the medium is the message - could one say the blogosphere is the blog?).Why networked writing? For me, blogging and networked writing is interesting because:Nodes and network graphsEvery blog and every post exists as a node in a web of connections. This has two direct implications, firstly that you (anyone!) can create new nodes in the network. Creating a new blog or a new post creates a new node that can reference and participate in the web of connections between nodes is exciting! Secondly, it implies that the connection between the nodes is important. Every blog and every post can live as both node and as connection.What does that mean? It means you can write a post that is directed within the network. If you want to get on the radar of a blogger - write about their ideas and reference them. The lowly hyperlink is a connective tissue that creates a network graph between the nodes.Collectable and addressableEverything is indexed and searchable by default on the web and search engines do a good enough job but indexation and search is only one dimension of discovery and the content network graph has more dimensions than that! There’s room for curation, lists, pointers to things. Plenty of link blogs do this very well (though increasingly these are moving to email newsletters)You can think of creating sets of posts and sets of blogs as the network infrastructure - aiding discovery and exploration of the network. This is of course only possible with stable addresses (i.e. URLs!).CommentableCommenting is dying a death on the web - disqus, the only real solution that works just recently got sold to an ad tech company and no one knows what the future looks like here but it’s always been a crucial piece of the networked architecture to be able to comment and respond to posts in a way that allows others to see the network activity.I’m curious to see Nathan’s approach to “discuss on twitter” see here for example - the new twitter threading UI feels pretty good at this though definitely still not “solved”.So, what’s next?Thought experiments in networked writingSo what would be some new exciting options and ideas for networked writing?  Open Feeds - I wrote a little about this before in resisting hyperfeeds but I maintain my own publicly accessible feed reader at tomcritchlow.com/feeds and if more people did the same I think we might be able to make RSS have a come-back moment. There’s something interesting about more explicitly exposing my own network activity to others…  In-line comments - Commenting is the next big piece of open blogging architecture to change. We’ve been trained through Google Docs and other tools that in-line commenting works and is a solved UI problem but no one has yet built a satisfactory infrastructure for it (yes, we’ve been trying for a while, remember sidewiki?). I’m curious where this next innovation will come from. Perhaps from hypothes.is.  Open drafting - This isn’t a technology problem but the deeper I get into blogging the more I realize a non-trivial amount of the value for me and for my network is in the drafting and editing phase. My longer blog posts often get reviewed by 5-10 people in a Google doc with long in-line comment threads before they even make it to the blog. The connections and discussions that shape the drafts and happen around them are exciting. I’m curious to see what a more explicit process of exposing, collaborating and sharing draft blog posts would look like (if only we all drafted in Google Docs together and could browse each others drafts?!)  Pingbacks 2.0 - pingbacks got ruined by SEO spammers but there’s a real need for better tools for networked authors. What dashboard is there besides Google Analytics that shows where/how your content is getting referenced and discussed? How can we build better self-hosted tools that offer insights and power tools for writers to better plug the writing into the network.What would you want to see from networked writing? How do you think about it? What tools would you like to see?(PS - I’ve enabled hypothesis in-line commenting on this page as a trail. Check it out and see how you like it! I don’t think it’ll replace disqus for now but it’s fun to experiment with it.)"

How do you think about it? What tools would you like to see?(PS - I’ve enabled hypothesis in-line commenting on this page as a trail. Check it out and see how you like it! I don’t think it’ll replace disqus for now but it’s fun to experiment with it.)"

We’ve forgotten that to move someone to action they need to see a message repeatedly. You have to earn trust. You have to earn respect. Loyalty is a product of repeatedly experiencing delight and care.I’ve spoken with several people who just seem, well, tired of the thought of starting up a content marketing machine or trying to “build an audience”. Well - f-that. How about just nurturing, delighting, educating, informing, making connections with and, yes, having a conversation with your existing audience, clients, or friends?And you know what - it’s not all or nothing. By creating things that delight, inform and connects that trusted network you’ll end up building a following anyway. Genuine ideas and discussions have a habit of breaking out and finding the right audiences.So forget the hypergrowth and the “10 ways to do…”.

  "content": "Three years ago today I walked out of Google into the crisp autumn air of independence. My friend Jonathan Schnapp hosted a quit party for me at the Royal Palms shuffleboard club and I was suddenly out on my own.It feels a lot like being on a endless road trip - a feeling of ultimate freedom interlaced with a nagging anxiety of being adrift with no stable home.Overall, year 3 was wonderful and I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to pay the bills doing what I do and still get home most days to read Roxy some Harry Potter before she goes to bed.Some quick highlights from the past 12 months:  Traveled to Australia, Detroit, Seattle, San Diego, Delaware, Wisconsin, Connecticut &amp; Manhattan for work. For the big trips I took the family with me, and I feel like I’ve done interesting travel without having to live life away from family.  Watched my daughter learn to walk, talk, eat, laugh, joke, hurt, sleep, not sleep and so much more.  Got back into the swing of conference speaking with SearchLove in San Diego, a company-wide client presentation in Sydney and a future trends presentation for a private equity firm and their portfolio companies in Wisconsin.  Continued to blog regularly-ish. I’ve published 10 posts in 2017 and averaged about one a month for the past two years. Sometimes I wish I wrote more but I’m pleased with the longevity of it. Blogging continues to be one of the most rewarding ways to use the internet for me.  Helped multiple clients think through branding, positioning and mission/vision work. While I certainly wouldn’t say I’m an expert here I know enough to provide meaningful insights for clients and have been lucky enough to work alongside excellent partners such as Midnight where the scope is beyond my skills.The positioning for my work I came to last year is holding up pretty well. Here’s how I describe what I do when asked:For content companies looking to invest in growth I’m the secret weapon embedded in your organization to build &amp; lead strategic initiatives.The focus on deep embedded work led to some very long client engagements and most of 2016 and 2017 was dominated by two large multi-year projects both of which wrapped up this summer. So the road ahead is opening up again. Time to roll down the windows, put on the roadtrip-mixtape and go where the wind blows!So what’s top of mind for me as I head into the next year? I’ve broken it down into 5 obsessions:Obsession #1: Workshops as workAll business problems are ultimately people problems. Sure, I love putting a good spreadsheet or presentation together but what really lights me up is getting in a room with clients and collectively going deep into what the actual challenges and opportunities are.Almost all of my client engagements now start with an initial workshop (in person preferably) allowing us to cover a lot of ground and dive into the business without ignoring the weird, beautiful multi-faceted people involved in the process.The best size for these workshops is 4-6 people and my best tip from Matt Webb is “always have something on the table”. It’s key to bring inspiration and outside thinking into the workshop to avoid it becoming purely insular. A good workshop ultimately has to be about the world and how the client fits into the world.Not only that - but it’s too easy to think you know a client’s business but if you’re not close enough to smell them you’ll miss the necessary nuance needed to execute. I’m constantly guided by this lovely definition from Stripe Partners to view strategy as “an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade”.Yes. Yes!Obsession #2: Supporting independenceOver the past three years I’ve found myself a merry little band of independents. Those peeking through the cracks of late stage capitalism into the future - what Franco Berardi calls “fractals of time and pulsating cells of labor.” I’ve talked before about how useful it is to have a network around you when you’re on your own but specifically I’m starting to assemble a set of peers who are doing similar work - of course the joy is that everyone is doing their own unique blend of work but there’s enough overlap to feel like we can draw on each others experience.I’m excited to keep connecting the dots here and helping those just starting out as well as learning from those who are far more experienced than I am. Perhaps look for an unconference of independents in 2018 if I can find the time… In the meantime, if you’re an independent consultant drop me a line, I’m always keen to chat.For more here see my post a fieldguide for independent strategy consultants.Obsession #3: Effective consultingI’m increasingly coming to the idea that effective strategy consulting is all about ways of seeing (the phrase taken from the John Berger TV series). As a consultant your job is to bring new ways of seeing to the client and then turn those insights and realizations into strategy and execution.I touched on this above with the workshops but how do you actually effect change within an organization? Anyone who tells you it’s easy is lying. For years I’ve tried to do more than produce reports and documents but I still feel like there’s a lot to learn and explore here.In particular - I’m really interested in how much internal content within a company plays a role in the spread of ideas. I also coined the term consulting fast and slow which I really like and sums up a bunch of my thinking on this.I dived in deep to explore this idea in my post the consultant’s grain.I went on to write about the critical question of telling a client their content is not good enough. I wrote up that thinking here: how do you measure good content. That post explored surveys as a way of reflecting qualitative insights back into the client but I’m still looking for ways to reflect insights back into a business.Obsession #4: Branding in the age of contentMuch of my work involves content. But so much of content on the web is deeply flawed - there’s too much mediocre content written for no-one spread to everyone.As a society we’re pawing our way through glossy content in a seamless, attention-less way.Where does brand and emotion live in this world? It’s a provocation I’m struggling with but I think I’m starting to make some real progress and the more I look at it the more I think almost everyone is doing it wrong. That’s exciting. It either means I’m slowly going crazy, or… I’m on to something.Watch this space. But there’s some notes here: branding in the age of content.There’s so much more here.Obsession #5: Weird workLast year I wrestled with the idea of building a brand for my consulting work. Ultimately I decided not to go down that path but there’s still a nagging feeling there’s more interesting work to be done under a label that isn’t my own name. Like a record label, or an art collective, or a creative studio there’s the potential to carve out creativity into more weird forms than what I’m doing right now.I’ve been inspired recently both by friends who are building creative studios and by the radical architecture movement of the 60s that saw groups like Archigram and Super Studio emerge - these hybrids of professional studio practice, art show, philosophy, small batch publishing, zines and just generally weird work.So I’m starting to explore more creative avenues and partnerships to create more provocative work. Maybe it’s co-creating with clients? Or producing a zine internally for a client? Or maybe it’s becoming a something-in-residence at an organization to explicitly explore those alternative areas…Who knows where that goes but I’m going to try and get a little more weird in 2018…Thank youFinally - thank you to everyone who came along for the journey with me. Friends, peers, blog readers, breakfast companions, late night whisky drinkers, clients and more. Thank you! Wouldn’t be here without you.(For reference, here’s my update last year from two years on the road)"

  "content": "Three years ago today I walked out of Google into the crisp autumn air of independence. My friend Jonathan Schnapp hosted a quit party for me at the Royal Palms shuffleboard club and I was suddenly out on my own.It feels a lot like being on a endless road trip - a feeling of ultimate freedom interlaced with a nagging anxiety of being adrift with no stable home.Overall, year 3 was wonderful and I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to pay the bills doing what I do and still get home most days to read Roxy some Harry Potter before she goes to bed.Some quick highlights from the past 12 months:  Traveled to Australia, Detroit, Seattle, San Diego, Delaware, Wisconsin, Connecticut &amp; Manhattan for work.

  "content": "As a consultant working with content companies, I often find myself bridging editorial and business. That squishy area between editorial values and business metrics. There’s a simple  question that quickly arises:How do you measure content quality?I think we can all agree that page views aren’t the way to measure content, nor social media shares. Equally you can’t just rely on the intuition of the editor in chief… So what metrics do you use to evaluate content?This question of content quality is an important one. Whether you’re a media company producing content or a brand using content as marketing it’s important to have an understanding of whether the content you’re producing is “good”.I’m not looking to reduce everything to numbers here. I’m just looking for some useful frameworks or mental models to guide a team that is producing content to produce better content. Especially as a consultant coming in to help evaluate an organization and push them forward.(And no, this isn’t a conversation about happyclappy Medium.)The people I’ve talked to seem to have a pretty strong idea of what good content is. And pretty much everyone (myself included) thinks a strong “editor in chief” role can really help steer editorial quality.But there’s very little I’ve found about how you actually manage content production and how you might evaluate content quality. So… this is a request? Please send me whatever you’ve got!Below are some ideas and conversation starters for what I think is an important idea for anyone in the “content business”.Defining an editorial mission is a good start…In my presentation The State of Content from earlier this year, I made the link between defining an editorial mission and hiring a strong editor in chief to champion and bring that to life. I included this quote from the NYT 2020 report:  Our most successful forays into digital journalism […] have depended on distinct visions established by their leaders — visions supported and shaped by the masthead, and enthusiastically shared by the members of the department. […] These departments with clear, widely understood missions remain unusual. Most Times journalists cannot describe the vision or mission of their desks.I love this, and I still think this is one of the best ways to produce strong content that connects with an audience.But… I’m left feeling slightly unsatisfied. And, in particular, as a consultant I’m often in the weeds with a client trying to help them define an editorial mission and build processes and teams that can stick to it.And… I don’t have a good framework to turn to that helps a team to keep on track? Do you have one?Defining an audience and understanding their needs is also good…I’ve seen several examples of teams that tried to define an editorial mission without properly defining an audience (or audiences). And every time they came up short. Also from my state of content presentation, I love this quote (actually a twitter thread) from Kyle Monson:  Whether your employer is a publisher, a brand, or an agency. If you’re making garbage, help them do better. The good ones will listen to you and incorporate your expertise. In my experience, most of them really do want to do it right.  And believe it or not, super engaged communities often want to hear from the brands who serve them. And super engaged brands want to provide communities with things other than just “content”.  So if you find yourself writing pablum, narrow the audience to a core group of smart people who care about what the brand has to say. And then convince the brand to say something meaningful to that small, smart audience. Godspeed.Of course, don’t get me wrong… this is hard! Especially the part about narrowing your focus. But defining an audience helps shape your overall editorial strategy but doesn’t help you judge individual pieces.Perhaps interestingness as a measure can guide us?When I put out a call on Twitter my friend Toby Shorin linked me to this Ribbonfarm piece books are fake and this quote in particular:  Interestingness is not a fixed property, but a move in a conversation between what everyone in the audience already knows (the “assumption ground“) and the surprise reveal. Being interesting means that the audience shares, or can be made to share, the common knowledge that the author seeks to undermine. Interestingness is a function of whatever body of knowledge is already assumed to be true. Therefore, it can be difficult to see the interestingness – the point – of a fragment of an alien conversation.Oh! This sounds useful - can we extend this into a measure of interestingness? Perhaps by shining a light on and agreeing upon a definition or outline of the assumption ground?I think there’s a thread to be explored here. My friend Sean Blanda said:I like this. And I don’t know of many organizations or individuals that care about “advancing the conversation” so I think there’s definitely something useful here. But it’s still a long way from being a real framework or process you can follow with any rigor… In a chat conversation between myself, Sean and Brian Dell we discussed whether it’s possible to add any rigor here. I love this from Brian:Ok now we’re getting somewhere! But, it’s that soft space. How do you make it less soft? How do you poke it? How do you make it less soft? I asked Jim Babb and he said:I’m not sure there are clear answers here. Seems that a lot of people are defining, measuring and thinking about this in lots of different ways.Surveys &amp; FeedbackOne tool in my arsenal that I’m relying on is a variation of the Google Panda Questionnaire. In short, it’s a 10-question survey that you can run on any web-page with real humans to get a measure of “quality”.It’s useful for a few key reasons:  The questions came originally from Google’s quality rater guidelines doc so the framework has some relevance. Companies understand why you want to use it as a benchmark.  It quantifies otherwise subjective measures like how much users trust the website.  It’s generic and you can use it for any site.The results from this kind of survey can be very powerful for company execs. This is an example from a client:The Panda survey is a useful tool1 but it’s geared towards evaluating site design and UX, though it does include aspects of content too.Maybe there’s a version of the Panda survey for evaluating content interestingness?What would a version of the panda survey look like specifically around judging editorial content? Could we construct an Editorial Value Survey (EVS for short) that looked like the following questions:  Did you find value in reading this content?  Does the opening paragraph make you want to keep reading?  Would you have finished reading this piece of content if you were reading by yourself?  Would you bookmark this content to come back to later?  Would you share this piece of content with a friend or colleague?  Would you share this piece of content on social media?  Would you describe this content as [insert Q relating to our editorial mission see above]  Would this piece of content make you want to learn more about who wrote it?Or, perhaps we need more of an internal process or framework?My solution here doesn’t necessarily need to be a user survey. It could just be an internal process of getting a group of employees and/or writers together and creating a scoring methodology for content. I had one client who could never define good content, so instead created a benchmark for good enough content. By defining the worse possible thing they could still publish it actually gave them a clearer focus for evaluating content.An internal framework could be a short list of questions to interrogate our content and we can have a small team internally rate content on the scale. My brother Will suggested that an exponential scale can sometimes be useful for these internal ratings to better catch outliers:This exponential scale might be useful. But perhaps all that’s needed is a simple checklist? Can we distill our editorial strategy into a set of checklist items to ensure that content aligns with our goals?What else?Ok, I’ll wrap up here. What am I missing? What frameworks, processes and metrics do you use to measure content quality in your content organization?(Aside as a closing note: this is all related to branding in the age of content - how we monitor, shape and think about perception and “brand” for companies that produce content at scale… Definitely more to unpack here.)–Footnotes:            In my research I’ve come to think Google based some of their methodology on the System Usability Scale originally developed in 1986.

Does the opening paragraph make you want to keep reading?  Would you have finished reading this piece of content if you were reading by yourself?  Would you bookmark this content to come back to later?  Would you share this piece of content with a friend or colleague?  Would you share this piece of content on social media?  Would you describe this content as [insert Q relating to our editorial mission see above]  Would this piece of content make you want to learn more about who wrote it?Or, perhaps we need more of an internal process or framework?My solution here doesn’t necessarily need to be a user survey. It could just be an internal process of getting a group of employees and/or writers together and creating a scoring methodology for content. I had one client who could never define good content, so instead created a benchmark for good enough content. By defining the worse possible thing they could still publish it actually gave them a clearer focus for evaluating content.An internal framework could be a short list of questions to interrogate our content and we can have a small team internally rate content on the scale. My brother Will suggested that an exponential scale can sometimes be useful for these internal ratings to better catch outliers:This exponential scale might be useful. But perhaps all that’s needed is a simple checklist? Can we distill our editorial strategy into a set of checklist items to ensure that content aligns with our goals?What else?Ok, I’ll wrap up here. What am I missing? What frameworks, processes and metrics do you use to measure content quality in your content organization?(Aside as a closing note: this is all related to branding in the age of content - how we monitor, shape and think about perception and “brand” for companies that produce content at scale… Definitely more to unpack here.)–Footnotes:            In my research I’ve come to think Google based some of their methodology on the System Usability Scale originally developed in 1986.

  "content": "You might think that being a consultant is easy. Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then…The change rarely happens like you recommended.Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:analysis -&gt; insight -&gt; recommendation -&gt; review -&gt; implementationAt best this is too simple, at worst it’s flat out wrong. The problem is just below the surface - you’re hired to change their company in a way they’ve so far been unable to change. That simple addition starts to help us understand the complexity and challenges of “consulting” or “strategy”.In summary - the key to effective consulting is to first understand the culture within the organization that resisted this change. And then recognize which recommendations go “with the grain” of the organization and which go “against the grain”. Going against the grain is a long slow process and requires changing people’s beliefs at scale.Every company has a grainWhen you’re hired to do a job you have to understand the central question:Why have they been unable to make this change on their own?Every company has a deep rooted culture. Some talk about it explicitly, some paint it on their walls, some just breathe it everyday. But every company has a culture. And that culture comes from the people - the messy organic interactions between founders, executives, workers, passionate employees, internal writing, internal talks, external press coverage and so much more.So as you think about putting together a strategy and a set of recommendations for a client you have to think clearly about whether what you’re looking to do cuts with the grain or against the grain of the organization.Going with the grain is fast, easy, seamless and requires moving fast and mostly just making the way forward more clear.  Example: I recall when I was working with Fundera a few years back and was helping them think through some content strategy. I pitched them on several concepts and themes to help elevate their content above just SEO-driven headlines. As an organization they were already primed to increase content quality and the founder Jared understood the value of content deeply so we almost instantly went from concept to details. This is a clear sign that you’re going with the grain - when you instantly get into logistics and execution. Fun fact, their series “the economics of…” that I recommended is still running today!Going against the grain is hard, messy, slow and can cause friction.  Example: I worked with a B2B saas client last year who wanted to re-balance their organization from being too sales-driven to being more marketing driven. The problem? Sales ran the show. Here, even though they were explicitly seeking help there were many organizational and cultural blockers to enable marketing to be a first class citizen within the company rather than just playing support to sales. Driving change here was messy and slow and it was increasingly obvious that what was needed was more than simply hiring a new VP of marketing.But how do we understand which way the grain goes? How do you understand culture as a consultant?4 ways to better understand a client’s cultureSometimes I wish I could be an organizational anthropologist for a living. The undocumented everyday lives of workers within systems (and how technology plays a role) is fascinating and nuanced. There’s no real blueprint to follow here. But here are some of the ways that I’ve found helpful to quickly get to the heart of what an organization’s culture is:  Get close enough to smell the client - by this I mean you should be meeting with them face to face wherever possible. Sit in meetings, run workshops, sit next to them while they work, overhear them on phone calls, go for lunch with them. And the digital equivalent is just as important - don’t settle for the sanitized presentations and polished documents they send to you - get invited to their slack, get access to their internal wiki, get inside their basecamp, get under the skin and into the spaces between the work. This helps you listen and understand what’s really going on but it also allows you to observe the small things - what kinds of wins do they celebrate? Do they work cross-functionally? Are there obvious tensions between groups or people?  Listen to the language - language and culture are inextricably linked so one of the best ways to understand culture if you can listen to enough chatter you can pick up on repeated phrases, repeated company myths, often cited documents or projects. Listen for patterns and repetition to really get a feel for the markers by which people are judging and aligning their work.  Note the extreme - this is a tricky one and requires careful listening. I’ve found that when dealing with execs and founders of companies, they will often use extreme examples as a way to illustrate or emphasize their point. I used to think that these extremes were deliberately used to get the change they want faster. Increasingly, however, I’m beginning to realize that these extremes are often much closer to their mental models than they might like to admit. Pay attention and work hard to synthesize why they’re using this extreme example (that sounds crazy!) and how you might actually bring it to life or implement it, there’s more truth here than they’ll admit.  Assume everything is deliberate - Don’t assume malice, but assume that everything is as it is because someone wanted it that way. Because mostly that’s how it happens. For example - a client wanting to hire their first VP marketing might be making a good decision but remember they got this far without a VP marketing! A series of deliberate actions led them here. If they’ve deprioritized something until now, ask why. What have they been prioritizing? That will shed light on their culture and how they think about their business. Actions speak louder than words.Consulting Fast &amp; SlowYou can (and should) go against the grain of the organization. That’s where the big important work is done. I think about it as consulting fast and slow (inspired by the book thinking fast and slow).Fast consulting is the aforementioned projects, ideas and change that runs with the grain where your goal is to clarify, articulate and execute.Slow consulting is the work that runs against the grain. I think about it a lot like running a campaign; you have to change mental models and belief systems at scale.Sometimes you need to start grassroots and build momentum from an ever increasing number of people, sometimes it’s a focused drip drip for key execs to get them to change their mind. Either way, the key in my mind is to build an ever-increasing momentum for the direction you want to take.Some ways you might campaign for change within an organization:  Send out a weekly message - A weekly email/slack/basecamp message highlighting evidence, anecdotes, case studies and more that supports your case can help change minds over long periods of time. Everyone appreciates being informed of industry trends and people love reading this kind of information (surprisingly there’s often a lack of good industry trend reading within companies).  Bring the outside in - Changing mental models and beliefs requires more than just telling someone. It requires showing them. Bringing the voice of the user/customer into the organization is powerful to reinforce a particular message. This can be done with focus groups or surveys but also just by surfacing and highlighting conversations on the web (i.e. twitter, quora, reddit etc).  Speak for the employees - In the case where the culture you’re trying to change starts at the top of the organization you are in a unique position as a consultant to identify key frustrations within the company and bring them to the attention of the execs in a way that they might actually listen.  Create language - Remember how language shapes culture? Well you can inject a little of your own culture by repeatedly using language, referencing examples and showcasing the direction you want to go in. This is especially true if you’re embedded within the organization and in their slack channels or working out of their office.In addition, there’s a secret weapon I don’t see talked about much: internal blogging. Yes, I harp on a lot about blogging but seriously, serialized, shareable content is a highly effective tool for campaigning for change and helping people to see things from your point of view:  Serialized - means you don’t have to create the magnum opus or manifesto overnight. Publish your thinking, publish your half-thoughts, publish your experiments, publish your links to interesting reading. The point here is to create a drip drip drip of ideas. So publish.  Shareable - this is often the hardest piece to do well within an organization. Don’t let your campaign for change get trapped within an email thread or lost in the slack stream, give it a permanent home, ideally a URL (shocking I know!). How you do this will depend a lot on what your tech stack looks like. When I was working at Google you could spin up a strictly internal App Engine instance so I used it to build my own blog where I had my own URL and I could publish content. It helps when you do this to use a format that’s not commonly used internally. Standing out helps any idea gain mindshare.If you only focus on one thing here though - hone in on the idea that it has to be shareable and easy to circulate. That could simply be with a google doc that has a big written “please distribute freely” label on it and access open to all within the company.When I was at Google (pre-slack!) we used Google+ as an internal social network experience and that was effective at bubbling up disparate voices who were “blogging” internally. As an example of what this looked like this was a great piece that made it outside the walls: Steve Yegge’s platform rant.The Consultant’s GrainAh. There’s one more piece to this puzzle. I’ve talked a lot about the organization’s grain. This was a concept I fully realized and started to deliberately address about a year and a half ago. But only more recently have I stumbled across the uncomfortable though obvious follow up: the consultant has a grain too.Let’s reframe that positioning of why consulting is hard - you’re hired to change their company in a way they’ve so far been unable to change and you will attempt to do this in ways you’re comfortable with.It’s important to realize that businesses come in so many more shapes and sizes than you read about in the tech press. And you’ll have some preconceived notions of how a business should operate, some of which may or may not work or be appropriate for a given client.In short - while you can work against the grain within an organization up to a point, there is definitely a limit to the amount of friction you can generate. Too much friction and things will get set on fire. Projects, teams, people, ideas, budgets.So when you’re considering change within an organization you have to understand your own bias and take a long hard look at which of your usual ideas and often-repeated mantras actually apply to this client, and which are pushing too far against the grain. And, importantly, which of your go-to ideas are explicitly with the grain of the organization.Because without some kind of forward motion you’re not going to be able to stick around long enough to get the bigger change done.Further reading on consultingHopefully this piece is relevant both for external consultants and for internal change agents. If you found this interesting here’s some further reads about the consulting world that made me think recently:The management myth - a great rallying cry for the need for humanities and human thinking and some great context on where management consulting comes from in the first place.Strategy as an unfolding network of associations (PDF) - kind of dense but fascinating case study of evaluating strategy within the context of culture:  The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade.Of strategies, deliberate and emergent - Thanks to Thomas Hogenhaven for pointing me in the direction of this one:  Since strategy has almost inevitably been conceived in terms of what the leaders of an organization ‘plan’ to do in the future, strategy formation has, not surprisingly, tended to be treated as an analytic process for establishing long-range goals and action plans for an organization; that is, as one of formulation followed by implementation. As important as this emphasis may be, we mould argue that it is seriously limited, that the process needs to be viewed from a wider perspective so that the variety of ways in which strategies actually take shape can be considered. For over 10 years now, we have been researching the process of strategy formation based on the definition of strategy as ‘a pattern in a stream of decisions’Small groups and consultancy - by the ever brilliant Matt Webb:  I don’t think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company’s nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it’s not thinking straight, that the organisation isn’t put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.The art of sharing - Jan Chipchase is a master at this and I can’t wait to read the full handbook but this excerpt is especially relevant for the sharing / campaign thinking I mention above.Consultancy, Creativity and Cooking with Sunday Dinner - from the great Lindsey Slaby thinking about new ways of getting creative projects staffed, funded, connected and thought about.

Here’s some things I’m thinking about right now. I’d love to hear your thoughts. @tomcritchlow or comment below.First - what do I mean by a content business? The definition is broad but any business that generates a large amount of content, and where content is the product. This could be anything from a media site like racked.com or an affiliate business like nerdwallet.com. There’s obviously a large range in the middle too.The primary difference is that content businesses are often horizontal vs vertical. A vertically integrated company like for example Warby Parker or Allbirds has a much easier time branding because they own the whole consumer experience, from the brand awareness top of funnel content, to the retail experience all the way down to the packaging and unboxing (and customer support and loyalty post-purchase).This type of branding is the type of branding we typically talk about when you read case studies and learn about branding.So how do the rules change for a content business?Typically a content business is horizontal - i.e they aim for a large surface area of touch points and generate large amounts of content. But the typical experience with any piece of content is shallow and transactional. Take Nerdwallet for example. They’re a dominant force in the online personal finance space and cast a very wide net. They write on anything from the best credit card to 5/1 arm mortgage rates to small business loans (and much more!).A user experiences content primarily through organic search - Nerdwallet has ~90% of their traffic from organic search. This traffic is mostly transactional - users are looking to get an answer and get out (ideally through an affiliate link which is the Nerdwallet business model).That’s not a bad thing - Nerdwallet has a strong business. But it poses challenges for branding because Nerdwallet owns so little of the user experience.So for a horizontal content business how would you think through a branding project? These are not answers but rather conversation starters:  The same as any other branding project it’s still critical to figure out who you are and why you matter. But the end result of a typical branding project with a tightly controlled landing page and/or a hero video ad campaign simply isn’t relevant. There are too many touch points for consumer to tightly brand each one.  The obvious answer here is that any horizontal business should be looking to own more of their audience. This typically means building an email list (something Nerdwallet has pursued more aggressively in the past 6-12 months via email signup for credit score information). You can learn a lot about building a brand and audience from content sites where email is the primary channel e.g. theskimm.com or thehustle.co. Key here is to carefully consider your calls to action to build the list - what language, branding and position are you taking with your audience? Putting a pop-up on the site and calling it a day is not enough here.  Think through the experience of interacting with the content on your site. Words are cheap but you can still design unique experiences at scale. Think interactive content formats, unique video styles, branded information boxes  Highlight and integrate strong author personalities across your content. Faces and personalities are strong ways to stand out and define a position in the market.  Define a point of view for your content and ensure that your tone of voice, style guide and writing style reflects this. A lot of content is overly generic online and the luxury of most horizontal content companies is that they can adopt a casual writing style that is unique and quirky. Of course, casual and quirky is not always the right approach.  Design and layout play a part here but frankly so long as you’re clean and nicely designed it’s relatively hard to actually stand out here. You can define a visual aesthetic that works and for sure some are better than others but the emotional resonance of your visual aesthetic is a smaller factor than for a vertically integrated business.  Flagship “hero” pieces of content that are shared far and wide (either organically or via paid distribution) can set the tone and define what your brand is “known for”. In the absence of vertical owned product, your pieces of content that get the most visibility are your product so work hard to ensure your brand is polished and consistent there.  The context around how people share your content and talk about it (either on-site in comments or off-site on social). So a key hire for horizontal content businesses is a community manager / social media manager. The experience of content is intrinsically linked to the discussion of it so brand plays a very strong part here.What is your experience with the brand of content? Any good examples to share? Would love to hear your thoughts below or on twitter. Holler at me!–Update - my friend Elan from design strategy firm Midnight had a great quote “every page is the about page when users discover your content from search” which I think is a great way of putting it. Don’t underestimate the number of people who land on your content and have either no knowledge of your brand or a very limited understanding of it.Update 2 - Sean Blanda just posted a great thread on content + brand. Good food for thought."

Social media technologies collapse multiple audiences into single contexts, making it difficult for people to use the same techniques online that they do to handle multiplicity in face-to-face conversation.source  The problem is not lack of context. It is context collapse: an infinite number of contexts collapsing upon one another into that single moment of recording. The images, actions, and words captured by the lens at any moment can be transported to anywhere on the planet and preserved (the performer must assume) for all time. The little glass lens becomes the gateway to a blackhole sucking all of time and space – virtually all possible contexts – in upon itself.sourceThis theory of context collapse applies to individual creators but more-so for brands. Their multiplicity of audiences is terrifying for branded content creators, often lost within a dizzying org chart of agencies, internal agencies, clients and departments.How to spot Context Collapse? Narrative Deficiency.The right lens to see context collapse is the concept of narrative deficiency from my good friend Brian Dell:Nothing happened to no one for no reasonWhen viewed through this lens almost all branded content is nothing more than transient cheap bad marketing.So how do you escape Context Collapse?I take all of my new media innovation advice from dead authors, so here’s John Steinbeck:  Forget your generalized audience. In the first place, the nameless, faceless audience will scare you to death and in the second place, unlike the theater, it doesn’t exist. In writing, your audience is one single reader. I have found that sometimes it helps to pick out one person—a real person you know, or an imagined person and write to that one.sourceAnd modern-day-dead-author Joshua Topolsky agrees:  Compelling voices and stories, real and raw talent, new ideas that actually serve or delight an audience, brands that have meaning and ballast; these are things that matter in the next age of media.[…]We’ll have to learn a thousand hard lessons, most of them centered around the idea that if you want to make something really great, you can’t think about making it great for everyone. You have to make it great for someone. A lot of people, but not every person.source: your media business will not be savedAnd the internal strategy group of the New York Times found basically the same thing, that context is the key to success:  Our most successful forays into digital journalism […] have depended on distinct visions established by their leaders — visions supported and shaped by the masthead, and enthusiastically shared by the members of the department.

And super engaged brands want to provide communities with things other than just “content”.So if you find yourself writing pablum, narrow the audience to a core group of smart people who care about what the brand has to say.

  "content": "A few interesting strategy roles for media companies have come across my feeds recently so I thought I’d post them all in one place in case anyone is looking.Senior Strategist, Quartz Creativelink  Quartz Creative is the in-house creative shop at Quartz. We help brands make interesting and effective “things” for people, designed for the ways they live and experience media. We’re part of the Quartz family (qz.com, Daily Brief, Quartz App, Quartz AI, Quartz Bot Studio). We put the user at the center of our thinking, and our work.  We are looking for a high-energy, fast-paced creative and strategic doer to help guide our clients into new spaces and big ideas. We want a curious mind who researches like an academic and writes like a screenwriter. Equal parts analytical and imaginative, with a nose for insights that can inspire creative opportunities, and a storyteller’s instinct for delivery.Newsroom Strategy Editors, New York Timeslink  The Newsroom Strategy team is looking for new members to help the newsroom design, structure and implement crucial changes in our report and the ways we work.  As a member of the team, you’ll serve as an advisor, problem solver and project manager in transformation efforts big and small. A few of the team’s current and upcoming projects include helping to develop new approaches to editing, reimagine the print newspaper and accelerate the expansion of visual journalism, among other elements of Dean and Joe’s recent action plan for the year ahead.Director of Editorial Growth, Vox Medialink  Vox Media is a technology-driven media company. We’re solving the problem of developing high-value digital journalism, storytelling, and brand advertising at scale—and empowering the most talented web voices and their audiences with Chorus, our modern media platform. We got our start innovating in sports media with SB Nation, the largest and fastest-growing network of fan-centric online sports communities. We now have eight brands including Polygon, The Verge, Vox.com, Curbed, Racked, Eater, and Recode.

  "content": "This is the story of how a weekend project and 276 lines of Python got me a job at Google. But it’s also a lesson I often tell - that side projects should be art or poetry. To be useful for your life they don’t need to be businesses.And - in the networked world, launched projects are currency.Let me tell you a story first.Act 1: Fuck Yeah SpotifyOne rainy day in Seattle in 2011 I was looking out the window at the grey rain and searching for interestingness. Spotify hadn’t yet launched in the US but it was looking increasingly likely that it would launch any day.Having recently taught myself Python to build a books website, stitching APIs together was top of mind and I came up with the simple idea of aggregating the top tweeted Spotify albums every day.The premise was pretty simple: use the topsy api to find the top spotify album URLs for the last 24 hours, run each of those through the Spotify API to get artist name and album title. Then run those through the Last.fm API to get album art.It looked a little something like this:And I launched it like this:Boom! New coding project is now live: http://fyspotify.appspot.com showing the top tweeted spotify album from the last 24hrs. Auto-updating.&mdash; Tom Critchlow (@tomcritchlow) March 22, 2011I didn’t then, and I don’t now, know how to code Python very well. Perhaps because of that, or because of the glitches in the Topsy data it never actually returned the top tweeted albums. Instead it just collected some albums people had been tweeting about that day. Because of it’s broken-ness I actually came to love it more. (I wrote about this a little in random acts of algorithms)Act 2: The Music Entrepreneur Applies for a Job at GoogleWhen I was interviewing for a job at Google in 2012 on the resume I wrote, at the bottom of the second page under “other skills” I wrote this:  At the end of 2010 I started teaching myself how to code Python and have developed various applications on Google’s Appengine platform including www.7bks.com &amp; fyspotify.appspot.comWhen I included this I was trying to demonstrate that I could code a little, I was trying to show a breadth of skills and suggest that I was more interesting than your average marketing geek. Then, to my great surprise I proceeded to get asked in all 7 interviews about “my music startup” or “what made me a successful music entrepreneur”.err.Something had gone wrong I thought - there’s been some crossed wires. Each time I’d be very anxious and keen to downplay the success, technical merit or interestingness of Fuck Yeah Spotify. After all, this was Google and a weekend project in Python was surely nothing worth talking about?I got the job, abandoned the site and let it fall into disrepair. End of story…?The Thing Is, Even at Google, Most People Haven’t Launched Something on the WebOver the years I’ve thought about this encounter a lot. Probably too much. Would I have gotten the job at Google without it? Probably.But one thing I do know - from experience both inside Google and from running a consulting practice where I have been involved in interviewing and hiring a wide range of people. The thing I know is this:It’s a massive differentiator to have launched something. To have had an idea, and put it into the world.Even at Google I realized - most people I worked with had never actually put their own ideas out into the world. Everything they had worked on was a work project or a byproduct of their job.When I’m running interviews I’ll always ask “name something that you’ve done that was 100% you - something you had the idea for and then made, doesn’t matter how big or small”. You’d be surprised how many people pause at this question and struggle to think of an answer. Most people in fact will answer this question by talking about a project that they were a part of.I’ll say it again - a shockingly small number of people have built their own thing on the internet.Projects are currency in a networked worldI think the commonly accepted wisdom around careers, work, skills and so on is wrong. We’re still coming to terms with the networked world we live in.But it’s becoming increasingly obvious that projects - launched, defined, things - are currency. They project who you are, how you think. They connect the dots between influence, skills, interests, ideas, people and cultures. But most of all they demonstrate output.A byproduct of the networked age is the bullshit industrial complex - where talking about ideas is more common than the ideas themselves. Where the antidote to this is just to launch something. To build and make things rather than reposting others work.Get out of your feed. Make your own feed. Put something new out there. Launch something. Don’t worry about the form or function. A newsletter. A meetup. A zine. A self published book. A daily tumblr. An app. A t shirt collection.Put something out into the world that is yours. That allows you to demonstrate what you’re capable of. Keep it weird. Keep it yours.And if you don’t, someone else will.A Note on The Privilege of Side ProjectsI think it’s worth noting that there’s a certain luxury of time that affords side projects that comes wrapped up with privilege. Oh, sure, just take some weekends and learn Python and build something. Some people use their weekends to work second jobs not launch side projects.That’s why I’m always keen to stress how small these ideas can be. A tinyletter newsletter is enough! You don’t need to be technical or devote a ton of time to it. Just find something you’re interested in and carve out a simple, tiny flag on a little patch of sand that says “I made that”."

  "date": "December 14, 2016",
  "content": "I’ve been enjoying writing posts recently that are more collections of half-formed thoughts than complete works and so I’m going to do it again with this post. What follows is an outline, or a collection of conversation starters, for digital strategy consulting.A few close friends of mine are considering making the leap into becoming freelance consultants and so I wanted to provide some pointers.Before I dive in though - I want to really reinforce the idea that if you don’t have a strong referral network, being freelance may not be the right path. I’ve seen people manufacture networks from scratch (through blogging, extreme participation in communities etc) but it’s hard! Most successful consultants have some kind of network pre-built.If you do have a network, then the second most important thing is to build some trust totems - be it conference speaking, previous companies worked at, case studies, books published or whatever. Something that allows people to say “I want to work with that person and I believe they will do a good job”.With those out of the way - here’s some collected notes:Finding Clients90% of your clients will come through your referral network (see above!)Personally I prefer to work directly with clients but I know successful folks probably earning more than me who depend on leads from other sources (such as other freelancers and agencies) and give kickbacks.The best marketing you can do is to a) stay top of mind for your referral network (be visible, blog etc) and b) help define for them what it is you do (and/or want to be doing).Create a community around yourself. Seek out likeminded independents, seek out others in the industry, host roundtable discussions, host breakfast meetings, start an email list or a slack group. Starting is infinitely better than joining, but if you have to join at least make sure you contribute instead of just lurking.Respond fast to all inbound leads but be prepared for leads to take 3+ months to close.A well written email outlining what the core problems are and how you’d address them with two options for pricing will outperform a pitch deck most days of the week. (See how to write a short proposal from Alan Weiss and his collected examples)PositioningHeading out on your own you’ll likely have ideas about what kind of work you want to be doing. But you probably won’t be able to get there straight away - it took me 12-18 months before I was starting to do the really interesting work I dreamed of when I quit my job.For your first 6 months focus on paying the bills rather than worrying about the type of work you’re doing. Patience.Don’t be afraid to meander through conversations with leads - I’ve often had wide ranging conversations before deciding on a specific project to work on with a client.That said, once you have some clarity clear positioning is effective - even if it’s in your own head. Try outlining the kind of companies you’re best able to help and the best kind of work you want to do. (See my latest positioning in this post)Start a company and a brand. Or don’t. Up to you - I know folks doing it both ways. I decided not to, but the decision is personal.PricingIt’s ok to meander through client calls (as I mentioned above) but one thing you should have a clear idea about is pricing. It looks somewhat amateur to say “I’ll get back to with my day rate”. You should have that at your fingertips and state your price with confidence.Don’t be ashamed of stating pricing. Invoice with confidence.Everyone says you should charge project based fees. They’re probably right and I’ve included many project based prices in my proposals but ultimately almost all of my work is done on a retainer basis (ultimately tied to hours/days more or less closely). You can make a very healthy living on day-rate based work so don’t fret about all those people telling you you’re wrong. Patience.Asking for money is weird. But you’ll get over it.I’ve personally been very lucky with clients paying their bills on time but almost everyone I know struggles with this so always factor in getting paid late.When a client isn’t paying their bills get a direct contact in accounts and raise hell. Don’t be nice.My invoice template is a simple Google Doc and my accounting is a spreadsheet. Don’t overcomplicate the mechanics and admin of your business.Doing the WorkYou can’t solve problems from 10,000ft. Get close enough to smell the client - get onsite, get invited to their slack, get integrated into basecamp, start conversations, chit chat, look in analytics.Never write a document for the sake of it - focus relentlessly on the output you’re aiming for and always ask yourself if you can skip the document and get to the end result.Think about running workshops. They’re very effective tools (secret: a workshop is just a fancy name for a meeting but usually has better results).Be comfortable switching between presentations, spreadsheets and docs (and of course slack, email and basecamp). You’ll have to straddle multiple modes and lower switching costs to be effective across multiple clients throughout a working week.Learn how to make basic prototypes - whether that’s in code or design. Showing a sketch of a finished thing is far more powerful than talking about it in a presentation.Communication solves all problems. Communicate liberally with your client.If you’re charging a “high” day rate don’t be afraid to roll up your sleeves and do the work. The last thing someone wants is a consultant who’s all talk but won’t get stuck in.Obsess about plugging gaps in your client’s organization. If there’s a report that they’re not looking at - don’t tell them about it, but make it (or an mvp anyway) and send it to them. There’s nothing leadership loves more than initiative. The classic failure mode of employees is thinking they don’t have permission or ownership to get something done. Your magic as a consultant is no permission, no ownership but a blank canvas.Every organization has a “grain”. Realize you can’t work against the grain without exceptional circumstances - so understand why that grain exists in the first place.Remember you know less about the client’s business than they do. Be humble. Ask a lot of questions.MindsetAlways be growing, don’t get complacent with clients, leads or revenue.Many clients will likely want to hire you fulltime. Be prepared to resist or else face a rollercoaster of emotions every single project.Focus. Don’t try and productize your work or start a startup before you’re comfortably paying the bills and settled into a groove.Never settle into a groove.Find a support network. There will be emotional rollercoasters.When client work gets quiet - make the most of it. Go bike riding, play with your kids, read a book. When client work gets busy there’s no one to do the work but you so you’ll work evenings and weekends so take the time off when you can!AdminStart an LLC. It’s really not hard. Keep business spending and personal spending separate. When you start earning real money consider filing taxes as a C-corp (which you can still do as an LLC).Get an accountant.Keep costs low. 2016 for me right now is operating at 98% margin. Paying for things can feel nice but you should question if you absolutely need them - coworking space, accounting software, facebook ads, business cards - all not entirely necessary so ask yourself before you spend.That said - spending on gifts for professional contacts, dinner with industry friends and so on is always worth the money. Do it liberally and often.…I’ll probably add to this list and expand some of the points into full blog posts over time. What did I miss? Drop questions or add your own ideas into the comments below!"

Be humble. Ask a lot of questions.MindsetAlways be growing, don’t get complacent with clients, leads or revenue.Many clients will likely want to hire you fulltime. Be prepared to resist or else face a rollercoaster of emotions every single project.Focus. Don’t try and productize your work or start a startup before you’re comfortably paying the bills and settled into a groove.Never settle into a groove.Find a support network. There will be emotional rollercoasters.When client work gets quiet - make the most of it. Go bike riding, play with your kids, read a book. When client work gets busy there’s no one to do the work but you so you’ll work evenings and weekends so take the time off when you can!AdminStart an LLC. It’s really not hard. Keep business spending and personal spending separate. When you start earning real money consider filing taxes as a C-corp (which you can still do as an LLC).Get an accountant.Keep costs low. 2016 for me right now is operating at 98% margin. Paying for things can feel nice but you should question if you absolutely need them - coworking space, accounting software, facebook ads, business cards - all not entirely necessary so ask yourself before you spend.That said - spending on gifts for professional contacts, dinner with industry friends and so on is always worth the money. Do it liberally and often.…I’ll probably add to this list and expand some of the points into full blog posts over time. What did I miss? Drop questions or add your own ideas into the comments below!"

But as an independent it’s harder to gain the kind of authority and reputation needed to get those opportunities. While I’ve not been pursuing the opportunities in earnest I’ve applied here and there only to be rejected, which never feels great.But this is a good signal that the brand I’m building as an independent is, frankly, just not that strong yet.

I get a kick out of exploring ideas with the audience. Provoking a change in mindset, provoking a new approach.It’s much the same as writing here - it’s not about an audience that just reads what I have to say. It’s about an audience that is moved by the ideas. Moved to engage. To email me. Or to comment. Networked writing.

  "content": "Two years ago today I quit my job and headed out on my own as an independent. I’d like to talk about it a little. Maybe I can be helpful to those behind me, maybe those in front of me can add their wisdom. Maybe I just need to write.Being independent is a lot like being on a road trip. Abandoning the social conventions of a secure home you set off on an adventure to who-knows-where. There’s a feeling of being free, but also of being untethered.I’ve got a page about how you can work with me that explains my work but to give you a sense of what I’ve been up to here’s some more intimate highlights from the last two years:  Worked as the interim CMO for startup Olapic - I really enjoyed the chance to flex my muscles in a broad marketing role, helping them organize their marketing efforts and launch a new product (and congrats to them they were acquired earlier this year!)  Worked with Distilled as an advisor and consultant for the NYC office as they rebuilt almost from the ground up to where they are today a growing, thriving team.  Took out a coworking space for a year and loved the ability to have a “home” but spent so much time on-site with clients that I decided to give it up.  Supported the New York Times Cooking site with SEO strategy. I’d never been inside the New York Times office and I loved the chance to work with very smart and passionate folks building something from scratch that reached many millions of visits.  Had a slow summer in 2015 and didn’t work for about three months, not by choice (eek!).  Helped companies find senior level marketing hires to build out their marketing operations. Watching the people I help hire go on and hire others is incredibly rewarding.  Almost built out a dedicated marketing recruitment business but eventually got too busy with work and being a new dad that I put it on hold. Watch for more on this in 2017.  Redesigned my personal site, almost created a brand for my consulting, but didn’t.  Worked with a really exciting &amp; innovative content company advising the management team on strategic special projects including various acquisitions.  Tried to get back into blogging in a more focused way, including a failed experiment in group blogging called #nycblogclub. Despite that, I still managed to blog more against the resistance.  Oh, and did I mention I had a daughter six months ago?What it all meansPositioning is on my brain right now having just wrapped up a positioning sprint for a client that is really electrifying the organization and helping align decision making. So, all of those experiences above combine to my current work in progress positioning statement:For content companies looking to invest in growth I’m the secret weapon embedded in your organization to build &amp; lead strategic initiatives.Let’s unpack that one piece at a time:  For content companies - I’ve got more to write about this but there are many different types of organization that are investing heavily in content. From traditional media companies like the New York Times or Complex Media (both previous clients) to startups investing in content to drive inbound marketing like Fundera (also a previous client).  Looking to invest in growth - My best clients are the ones prepared to invest in the future.  I’m the secret weapon - Many clients talk of me like a secret weapon, and I like it! It captures the spirit of my unique background across creative, technical and strategic projects.  Embedded in your organization - My best work is done face to face on-site with clients, whether for a workshop session or on a retainer basis several days a week. It helps me effect change much better than a traditional agency and, for the hiring work I do, allows me to get a strong sense of culture which is crucial for bringing in new team members.  To build and lead new strategic initiatives - The work I’m most excited about is the kind of work that touches whitespace - new strategic initiatives, building new teams, identifying new areas of growth and so on.It’s only me here, so there’s no aligning necessary(!) but it’s always useful to be able to articulate what you do. Like I said, it’s a work in progress but it’s starting to feel good.Some Themes From Two Years As An IndependentFrom all of the above, here’s some themes that have emerged and that I’m currently thinking about from the last two years:It takes a while to find your feetI’ve been lucky enough to have some great clients over the last two years but I spent more time in my first 12 months doing the kind of work I wasn’t as excited about. Routine SEO audits and so on. It felt like I was going backwards in my career and was a little disappointing at the time. Now I realize it was just part of building up to more interesting and exciting work. Nothing is set in stone as an independent so embrace clients that teach you something. Also, for my first 12 months just managing to pay the bills under my own steam was exciting.The network is everythingThis will seem obvious but it’s hard to overstate it. The network is everything. Only one client I’ve worked with over the last two years came outside my network - every single other client came from a friendly face making an email intro. Think about that for a second - it’s obvious, but the implications can be profound. It’s part of why I prefer to use my own name for my consulting practice, why I don’t pretend to be an agency, why pretty much all my marketing is just getting to know more people and then explaining what I do to people I know.Build a strong professional support networkSince starting out I’ve deliberately cultivated a set of contacts who are doing similar things to me - and I’ve found a lot of value in being as transparent as I can with them. What goes around comes around - I’ve talked about money, about invoice templates, about hosting providers, about job offers, about everything.This transparency and list of contacts that I can turn to when I have a question has been incredibly valuable and insightful. Remember you don’t know everything, there’s different ways of doing everything and sometimes you just need to know that someone has been through what you’ve been through.The emotional rollercoaster is realWhen you head out on your own people will tell you there are highs and lows. When you head out on your own people will tell you to brace yourself. To give up weekends. To kiss goodbye to vacations.Sure, but the best advice I got when I was just starting out was to enjoy the slow times - go for a bike ride in the afternoon, sleep in, write, code, create, relax, see art, see friends. Don’t stop pushing forward with your business but trust the process - and remember, if it’s just you there’s no way you can go bike riding in the afternoon when you’re busy!So… look to windward, brace for the strong winds and enjoy the wind in your hair.Make it a business, but be comfortable in your own skinI’ve deliberately tried to refer to myself as independent rather than freelance. It’s a distinction that maybe doesn’t matter too much but in my mind freelance means doing a fulltime job on a contract basis. It feels like employment. But independent to me means building a business that happens to only have one employee. It means trying to add value to an organization in any way I can, not just doing what I’m told.And if you read all of the blogosphere you’ll find that pretty much everyone advocates for charging on a project basis vs hourly basis. They’ll call you stupid for charging hourly and tell you you’ll never escape the rat race that way. While that may still be the best advice - cut yourself some slack. I’ve been doing this for two years and still mostly charge on a day-rate rather than a project fee but I’m ok with that. I’m still paying the bills.So try and make it a business, work to add value at all times - but do it your way. Don’t take the personality out of it.The Landscape for IndependentsBeing independent isn’t the only way to be, there’s a lot of value in being full-time and dedicated to a team and I don’t think I’ll stay self employed forever -  almost every client tries to hire me full time. But for now I see a strong environment for being independent:SEO is unbundlingLikely the topic for another post, but I’m seeing that SEO has become unbundled. All of the activities that make up “SEO” are now fully distributed between content teams, technology teams, biz ops teams, analytics teams and more. And more to the point, SEO has been around long enough that these teams have a working knowledge of SEO to the point that considering SEO as a centralized resource is becoming an outdated concept. I’ve worked with clients working on world-class SEO that don’t have a single “SEO” job title because it’s just embraced across the organization.Agency work is changingI’ve worked at an agency, I’ve worked in-house, I’ve worked as a consultant hiring agencies and I’ve consulted with agencies to improve their businesses. And what I’ve seen is that the agency landscape is changing. People are increasingly a fluid resource and agencies are responding by becoming distributed - but so are the clients! Lindsey Slaby wrote a great piece on this here.This shifting landscape is a great environment to work as an independent but embedded in organizations where you can be most effective and blur the boundaries between “inside” and “outside” bringing fresh thinking back inside.The road aheadSo with all of that said - it’s been an incredible adventure and I’m excited to keep exploring. We’ll see what the future brings and I’m incredibly thankful to everyone who’s helped out, referred clients, shown support or otherwise contributed to my success. Too many to name but thank you all.Stop by in the comments below and ask any questions you want! I’d love to hear your stories of being on the road too."

  "content": "I’ve been thinking a lot about indie blogging recently. The concept of writing on your own platform, or just writing in the fringes of other platforms. Writing with an independent voice.At least in the circles I frequent there’s an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the fact that the dominant platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Medium) have gobbled up all of the whitespace. They’ve sucked the energy out of the room for independent voices.But I simply refuse to buy it. Sure, there are some juggernaut platforms out there - and they control a lot of the web. But the web is a vast sprawling infinite city. Just because you only frequent the regular joints and shop in the malls doesn’t mean there aren’t thriving subcultures, weird neighborhoods and undiscovered alleyways.I saw a tweet storm from Craig Mod that give me a jolt of inspiration:The conversation here naturally turned to how people get their independent voices - only to arrive at the conclusion that TinyLetter (and newsletters in general) have filled a lot of this void.Then, I saw the newly built Pressthink - PressThink’s new design and third space:  Instead, I wanted to give my writing home on the web a refresh — especially with mobile becoming the standard — and add to it something new. I’m calling the new feature “the board.” Another term for it would be cards, a slightly different space for me to unfold what I think.  I don’t think indy blogging is done for. No way. More likely it’s due for a re-birth.I encourage you to check out the board - it feels new and interesting. Especially on mobile.We bemoan the death of forums - but what was the real essence of a forum? Nothing more than a shared agreement to keep showing up in the same place again and again. That community naturally formed all manner of interesting cultures and shared norms.The big platforms have certainly dominated that “shared agreement to keep showing up in the same place again and again” but our attention is large and our interests varied. TinyLetters are an agreement to keep showing up in the same place, PressThink’s new board is an agreement to keep showing up in the same place.And it struck me… You can’t divorce content creation from content distribution. We can’t rely on Twitter, Facebook or Medium to distribute our content - much as we need to own our platforms we need to also own our own distribution.Yes, you’ll own a fraction of the audience. A fraction of the eyeballs. But you’ll have a relationship with them much deeper and much stronger than anything built in someone else’s stream.So, here’s something of a little manifesto or rallying cry:  If you only spend your time on Facebook/Twitter/Medium then stream in, stream out - you’re going to get what you ask for. A fleeting set of stories loosely bound.  So, spend time in the corners of the web. Subscribe to some newsletters. Bookmark some forums and blogs in your browser and show up regularly. It’s hard, there’s no stream. But you’ll start to find the mom &amp; pop internet not the shopping mall internet.  Dabble with your own space. Dabble with your own voice. Own your own platform.  But don’t stop there - own your own distribution too! Build a newsletter. Build a messenger bot to alert people to new posts. Build your own stream. Create a shared delusion of showing up regularly.Long live the indie web.–Update - Dave Winer just put up bloggers.scripting.com which is a feed of a a bunch of “bloggers” (doesn’t that term feel like they’re a rare beast?). Perfect illustration of how you can’t divorce content and distribution."

  "date": "October 20, 2016",
  "content": "Twitter the company is in dire straits. They’ve raised too much money, floundered with product improvements, squandered their acquisitions, lost too much money and finally tried to sell themselves only to have no one want to buy them. Partly because of their spam/abuse problem and seeming complete lack of ability or desire to fix it.But, Twitter the platform is something meaningful and incredible. It’s like nothing else on the web - something that a dedicated userbase is glued to almost more than any other service online. If you ignore the abuse problems it’s almost a public good.I’m personally invested in Twitter - I’ve been a user for almost 10 years and it’s the app I use on my phone more than any other. Venkatesh Rao wrote a little series in his newsletter that captured the spirit of Twitter better than any I’ve seen:  1/ Hypothesis: there are technologies so basic that they serve as prequels to economic organization and utility vs. private type end-game debates  2/ Possible examples: Craigslist, Twitter,  Unix shell. One maybe: Wikipedia. They are all sui generis and defy analysis within categories  3/ They are destined neither for commodity status as private sector technologies, nor for utility status as public services.  4/ What they do instead is create frontier land, sparking land-grab economic races.  …  9/ Twitter “failing” to own the revolutions it obviously took mainstream (messaging, chatbots) isn’t a failure really if viewed that way.  …  11/ Wrong because it’s very incomplete. There’s like 10-15 Slack/Snapchat sized businesses left to carve out of the “Twitter continent.” Any single one is a full-time job for one company.  12/ Examples: Nobody has “pulled a Slack” on “political revolutions” product that’s inside Twitter, or the “nascent community” product  …  24/ Twitter and Craigslist have taught us some huge new things about how hundreds of millions of networked people behaveThe whole stream is worth reading.Fred Wilson, who is heavily invested in Twitter sums up from a more emotional perspective:  I realize that I am horribly biased on this topic and that others may not see what I see. But I have always felt that Twitter is a special company, full of conflicts and contradictions, that, maybe because of them, had the potential to deliver something unique, different, and compelling. And I continue to believe that.So what happens next?Ben Thompson of Stratechery pointed out this piece by Bronte Capital and I think we both largely agree with the points raised. Most clearly:  Twitter is past that. Somewhere near half a billion dollars of costs need to be taken out almost immediately. And that involves firing people and being a general tough-bastard. It’s inevitable anyway - because Jack Dorsey burning half a billion dollar per year isn’t a sustainable business. The cash eventually runs out.  The problem is if you mix this with a Salesforce.com or similar company it will be really hard to take costs out in a disciplined fashion without upsetting the culture of the home company. Instead this should be fixed (with extreme prejudice by a disinterested outsider) before it is sold again to a strategic buyer.  Or - in summary: the best bastards are from Wall Street. And this needs a Wall Street bastard.So what happens next? Likely a firesale and gutting of the business. And, I’d predict, followed shortly after by a widespread abandon ship of users.But where to?Twitter AlternativesThere have been a few Twitter alternatives over the last few years none of which have gained widespread adoption.First there was app.net - an ambitious project that tried to tackle the problem developer-first. Dalton Caldwell was one of the most vocal critics of the moves Twitter made to shut down the API and limit the developer aspects of Twitter, as he made clear in his piece what twitter could have been:  As I understand, a hugely divisive internal debate occurred among Twitter employees around this time. One camp wanted to build the entire business around their realtime API. In this scenario, Twitter would have turned into something like a realtime cloud API company. The other camp looked at Google’s advertising model for inspiration, and decided that building their own version of AdWords would be the right way to go.  As you likely already know, the advertising group won that battle, and many of the open API people left the company. While I can understand why the latter camp wanted to build an ad-based business, the futurist in me thinks this was a tragic mistake. If you are building an advertising/media business, it would then follow that you need to own all of the screen real-estate that users see. The next logical step would be to kill all 3rd-party clients, and lock down the data in the global firehose in order to control the “content”.Unfortunately the app.net experiment was too developer-centric and never really gained the adoption necessary.Then there’s alternatives that are coming at the whole Twitter space from a micropublishing perspective, for example 1999.io from Dave Winer. Some core principles behind the project from Dave:  A home page from which everything radiates.  A focus on simplicity, an intense level of factoring to reduce the number of steps it takes to post something new or edit an existing post.  I wanted the fluidity of Twitter and Facebook. It should be just as easy to create a new post as it is to write a tweet, of course without the 140 char limit.  …  I think of this as the first post-Twitter post-Facebook blogging system.While 1999 is still very new (despite the name) and still has plenty of time and room to grow I think the focus might be that it’s too strongly holding on to what blogging was (on purpose!) and as he says, intentionally focusing on “a home page from which everything radiates”.The problem is that while the publishing piece is fluid, fast and frictionless - the reading and distribution still has a lot of friction in it - as evidenced by having to navigate to homepages.And, of course outside the US there’s Weibo. From a piece on The Next Web:  Twitter has hit the skids as it struggled to keep users. The company has lost more than 5 million monthly active users over the past 12 months, attracting a total of 313 million users each month.  In contrast, Weibo is currently pulling in 282 million monthly visitors, but – unlike its American rival – it can brag with an increase of almost 70 million active monthly users in the last 12 months.And last, but not least - what about Facebook? I was struck by the deep insights around how Facebook is used by the farmers in Myanmar. Craig Mod wrote a wonderful essay that had this section on usage of Twitter and Facebook:  The Farmers don’t use their real names (“I used my son’s name,” Farmer fourteen told us. Why? “Because it’s a good name!” he said smiling and patting his 1-year-old son on the head.) They don’t have email addresses and so often don’t know their logins. If they get logged out they have someone—often the village Facebook guru—make them a new account. “Friends” on Facebook are friends only because the application calls them friends in the interface. The language of our apps shapes our expectations of our apps, but when the language isn’t your own, isn’t localized, that authority is undermined. “Friends” become something else entirely—random avatars who share an affinity for news stories you happen to stumble across. There is a fluidity to the Myanmar Farmer Facebook experience, one that makes me a little jealous. I feel a bit too locked into the rigidity of our western Facebook expectations. Those Farmers in Myanmar have what feels like a more native fluency than those of us supposedly well versed. Than those of us who say we know what we’re doing.  And yet I can’t help but wonder why Twitter fails to gain traction. It’s simpler. It consumes less bandwidth. It’s model is more minimal, the interface far less complicated. Facebook is a caricature of an interface—the equivalent of the space shuttle, all buttons and dials and switches, so many of which have nothing to do with the core user experience. And yet, these Myanmar farmers wade through the muck, compelled by information hunger.  But Facebook has a compelling advantage over other news apps or even Twitter: The content of many posts and news items live inside Facebook itself. There are external links, but most of the article summaries and photos are self contained. As Facebook continues to ramp up their Instant Articles—special versions of web articles that are leaner, load more quickly, and are Facebook optimized—the amount of content that lives in Facebook will only increase. For those who are data sensitive, this is a clear virtue. One certainly worth whatever learning curve may come with the platform.  Twitter recently announced that it will allow up to 10,000 characters “below” the tweet. If critical news can live inside of Twitter, in a fundamentally less bandwidth intensive and a simpler model than even Facebook, then the popular interest may shift. There is no explicit brand loyalty amongst these farmers.The Next TwitterSo each of these networks might somehow gain prominence or maybe Twitter will just expire and we’ll move on with a gap in our digital lives. But I do believe there’s something new waiting to be adopted - and the troubles with Twitter the company (cash, management) and Twitter the platform (abuse, spam, focus) make right now the perfect time for something to emerge.Crucially - while some aspects of Twitter might get carved up and taken more private within messaging apps and closed communities I think there’s a role for open media conversation and distribution that would be a big vacuum left if Twitter disappeared. Certainly Facebook has avoided involvement in media distribution - disseminating false, fake, clickbait viral news faster and wider than ever and removing humans from the process to claim no responsibility. While I find this approach dishonest and irresponsible it seems likely that they will just ignore this problem for the foreseeable future.So what will the next Twitter look like? Will it be more closed? More open? Will a messaging app pivot into something more open/closed? Will it look more like micropublishing or more like a central social platform? Will a software company like Google build the platform where media is distributed? Or will a media company build the software that distributes content?However it shakes out, we live in interesting times.What’s your thoughts?Update: @vgr posted a tweetstorm in response. Start here.Update 2: @willcritchlow posted a tweetstorm. Start here.Update 3: What if Bezos stepped in to build something here? His deep technical talents coupled with his ruthless focus on the user could make this a success I think - and it would be an ideal complement to his acquisition of the Washington Post. Hmm. More to think about here.Update 4: Of course I’m not the first or only one to think about Bezos &amp; Twitter. See Mark Suster’s tweet convo here."

  "title": "A Day In the Consultant's Life",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2016/08/29/day/",
  "date": "August 29, 2016",
  "content": "In my last post on Intentional Communities I got a request from Joshua Hardwick on what a “day in the life of a marketing consultant” looks like.So here we are. If you’re curious what I do generally, head over to my consulting page which describes some of the things I do for work - but doesn’t give much of a sense of what I do day to day. The truth is that it varies wildly, but let’s try and give a sense. I’ve picked two days from the last few weeks, one quiet and one busy to try and outline the extremes.FridayThis was a few weeks ago, just as I was about to launch Yes! and… (more on why I didn’t do that here).9am I headed into the city for coffee with a friend of a friend who works at a B2B SAAS startup here in NYC. Their situation is all too common - they’ve hit a certain level of scale and success but with very little focus on marketing - so they’re looking to bring on their first VP marketing (actually their second - again, a very common story where they cycle through several VP marketing people before finding one they like).11am Back in Brooklyn and working at 61 Local (the best place to get work done during the day in my neighborhood). Of course, by “working” here I’m actually just working on Yes! and - sending the site around to my friends and asking for feedback.Noon Headed to the YMCA to play some daytime hoops. With work being a little bit slower and nothing on the agenda for Friday afternoon I took the opportunity to get some exercise in. The best advice I’ve been given about being independent is to make the most of the slow times, when it gets busy there’s no time for daytime basketball so make the most of it! I remember I drained a bunch of 3s but kept getting burned by a point guard who was just better than me. Highs and lows.3pm A quick phonecall with a potential client to see if there would be a fit. Turns out their budget is very small and all they want is some help setting up a Facebook ads account so I pass them on to a friend who does that kind of thing and move on. I jam out some more work at 61 Local and I’m done for the day. It’s Friday after all.MondayI landed a new client in August where I’m helping them open a new office here in NYC. Busy busy.9am Jam out some emails first thing (9am tends to be my new first thing despite getting up around 6.30 most days with Roxy…). My inbox gets out of control easily and I have dedicated email addresses for some of my clients where I’m embedded in their organization so chasing inbox zero is a never ending task.10am - 5pm Head into the city to meet with the client. Helping them set up an office is fun work - it allows me to get involved in multiple parts of the business. This day involved:  Running 3 interviews, side by side with the client to help us both get a handle on how the client hires, and to collaboratively discuss the candidates. This work allows me to get the information I need to feel out potential candidates on my own in the future so it’s important work. One of these senior candidates is actually currently a chief traffic officer at their current role so the interview morphs into almost a back and forth learning session which is fun.

  "content": "In my last post on Intentional Communities I got a request from Joshua Hardwick on what a “day in the life of a marketing consultant” looks like.So here we are. If you’re curious what I do generally, head over to my consulting page which describes some of the things I do for work - but doesn’t give much of a sense of what I do day to day. The truth is that it varies wildly, but let’s try and give a sense. I’ve picked two days from the last few weeks, one quiet and one busy to try and outline the extremes.FridayThis was a few weeks ago, just as I was about to launch Yes! and… (more on why I didn’t do that here).9am I headed into the city for coffee with a friend of a friend who works at a B2B SAAS startup here in NYC. Their situation is all too common - they’ve hit a certain level of scale and success but with very little focus on marketing - so they’re looking to bring on their first VP marketing (actually their second - again, a very common story where they cycle through several VP marketing people before finding one they like).11am Back in Brooklyn and working at 61 Local (the best place to get work done during the day in my neighborhood). Of course, by “working” here I’m actually just working on Yes! and - sending the site around to my friends and asking for feedback.Noon Headed to the YMCA to play some daytime hoops. With work being a little bit slower and nothing on the agenda for Friday afternoon I took the opportunity to get some exercise in. The best advice I’ve been given about being independent is to make the most of the slow times, when it gets busy there’s no time for daytime basketball so make the most of it! I remember I drained a bunch of 3s but kept getting burned by a point guard who was just better than me. Highs and lows.3pm A quick phonecall with a potential client to see if there would be a fit. Turns out their budget is very small and all they want is some help setting up a Facebook ads account so I pass them on to a friend who does that kind of thing and move on. I jam out some more work at 61 Local and I’m done for the day. It’s Friday after all.MondayI landed a new client in August where I’m helping them open a new office here in NYC. Busy busy.9am Jam out some emails first thing (9am tends to be my new first thing despite getting up around 6.30 most days with Roxy…). My inbox gets out of control easily and I have dedicated email addresses for some of my clients where I’m embedded in their organization so chasing inbox zero is a never ending task.10am - 5pm Head into the city to meet with the client. Helping them set up an office is fun work - it allows me to get involved in multiple parts of the business. This day involved:  Running 3 interviews, side by side with the client to help us both get a handle on how the client hires, and to collaboratively discuss the candidates. This work allows me to get the information I need to feel out potential candidates on my own in the future so it’s important work. One of these senior candidates is actually currently a chief traffic officer at their current role so the interview morphs into almost a back and forth learning session which is fun.

  "date": "August 9, 2016",
  "content": "It’s late, I’m tired from a long day of consulting and I’m trying to blog. The baby is asleep, Erin’s out getting some laps at the pool. Blogging is hard but has given me so much over the years that I’m trying to get back into it.At some stage I need to write the definitive “why you should blog” post. I wrote a piece You’re not blogging my friend, and that’s a problem a while back and I like it but it’s not the piece. But that’s for another day. This post is about wanting to start but stumbling at the first hurdle. Let’s try and get you over that hump - here’s 7 things I’ve found useful to get blogging over the years:Blog for one person onlyOne of my favorite writing tips of all time is from Steinbeck. He says:  It is usual that the moment you write for publication—I mean one of course—one stiffens in exactly the same way one does when one is being photographed. The simplest way to overcome this is to write it to someone, like me. Write it as a letter aimed at one person. This removes the vague terror of addressing the large and faceless audience and it also, you will find, will give a sense of freedom and a lack of self-consciousness.Forget the general post, it’s hard to write with a general voice. But writing a letter is easy - you know what you want to say so just say it.Hi Brian. This post is for you.Release, Rework, ReferenceThis is more of a mindset than a specific tip - but it’s helped me think about writing. Especially about building a body of writing like you do with blogging. What is the value of a networked set of things I’ve written? Turns out - almost everyone I admire online, people that produce the kinds of things I wish I’d made all follow the same structure: release, rework, reference.What does that mean? It’s a concept stolen from The Calculus of Grit:  In physical space, latitude, longitude and altitude get replaced by arc-length, curvature and torsion when you go intrinsic.  In endeavor space, field, domain and years of experience get replaced by three variables that lend themselves to a convenient new 3Rs acronym: reworking, referencing, releasing (well, technically, it is internal referencing and early-and-frequent releasing, but let’s keep the phrase short and alliterative). I believe the new 3Rs are as important to adults as the old ones (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) are for kids.Alright - maybe that’s a hard one to parse. The piece is dense but you should go read it, and then look at how all the “greats” online follow this framework - they release often, they rework rigorously and they produce the kind of work that they themselves want to reference.So, a good place to start might be to start writing that piece that you want to reference all the time. That concept that is in your head that you bring up again and again in conversation. Get it out of your head and release it into the world. Then you can rework it later.Forget the writing - write for the discussionNetworked writing - aka blogging - is all about content as an idea vector. A conversation starter from me to you - if I write this and email it to you that will spark something. If you email it and send it to 5 people you’re sparking the same idea in 5 different ways. So forget writing for the words, write for the space between the word, between the ideas - write as connective tissue between people.Write it in a Google Doc and send it to someone for feedbackIf networked writing that is designed for one person is something we’re talking about - why not skip to the end game? Write it in Google Docs give your audience edit permissions and send it to them. I had a fascinating enlightening discussion with Toby Shorin of Subpixel.space all in a Google Doc draft of an upcoming blog post. Maybe it never becomes a post but certainly we had a fascinating deep engagement with the topic.Build an independent home for itYeah you heard me. Most writing advice says “don’t worry about the presentation, just write” but actually I think that’s backwards. If you have a hunkering to build a little independent home for your online presence go do it. Pour some love into the CSS. When you get a finished result you’re happy with what do you think is the first thing you’re going to want to do with it? Yeah that’s right. Write.Publish your workMost careers and most employers don’t like it when you publish your work to the web. But don’t worry about that - strip away the confidential stuff and publish an email you sent to your team. Or a presentation you did internally. You’re bleeding 9-5 every day into your work, so why not take some of that stuff and reclaim it as your own?My post on decentralized brands and the future of content marketing was purely a presentation that I gave that I decided I could republish as a blog post. It’s a short post but it was based on some real thinking and as such struck a chord with some folks (of course it helped that I emailed the piece individually to a few folks too…)(Brian - I’d love to just follow you for a day in your new job. Channel that excitement, that insider baseball and publish some bits of it.)Curate some interestingnessThe human brain is wired for labeling and categorizing things. And so we build mental models of topics by collecting ideas and storing them as labels in our brain. But remember, those labels are made up. And they likely don’t correspond to everyone else’s labels. So take a concept you have in your brain and unpack the concepts within it - write something that’s just pointers to the best writing within that label. You’ll be amazed at how valuable this is for folks who have that same label but a different mental model…(Brian - we talked about this idea over beer. Assemble some of the pieces around you in interesting ways and you’ll create something truly interesting).That’s all I’ve got for now. But I’m still plotting to write that master “why you should blog” piece… One day eh?What are your best ways to begin blogging again?"

But after realizing that this wasn’t really the approach that worked for me, I decided to abandon the new brand and instead consolidate my work right here at tomcritchlow.com with a new design, direction and purpose.First, Some BackgroundI’ve been an independent consultant for almost two years - working with large media companies such as The New York Times &amp; Complex Media and working with startups such as Olapic &amp; Fundera. After being out on my own for a while it’s about time that I put my professional foot forward and shared my own brand with the world. So I did some thinking and came up with a new brand: Yes! and..And then, after building the site and getting ready to launch (I even had a launch blog post written!) I decided to abandon it.Yes! and… No MoreIt’s a shame to abandon something that you put time and energy into, in particular because this was the first real branding project I’ve undertaken on my own and I was proud of the results:In fact, if you’re curious -  for now the whole site is still online here: yesand.nycWhy Build a Brand In The First Place?There are many reasons to build a brand and there is definitely a time and place for branding an independent consulting practice - my close friend Jim runs Part &amp; Sum which is his brand for the consulting work he does. It works well, especially because his work often involved assembling a team of collaborators and partners for his projects.For me, although I had a vague sense that I should “grow up” with my branding and I had this notion that perhaps consulting under my own name led to me missing out on higher value consulting jobs, if I were to talk in the third person I would mostly be pretending since the majority of my work is done by me.FearBut here’s the thing (and it was during a critical conversation with my friend Ron Garrett that I had this breakthrough) - the main reason I didn’t want to build a consulting brand under my own name was fear.Fear that people might not take me seriously.Fear that I’d seem amateur.Fear that I wouldn’t be able to be myself.And as with many things in life, I had to take the roundabout route of building the site, doing the work, thinking hard and reaching out to friends before I realized the root of the problem was fear and the way ahead was obvious.The Great Challenge of Personal BrandingPersonal branding, especially for (gasp!) a marketing consultant is terrifying. How do you escape being that arrogant person while still appearing professional and capable of well-paid work? How do I avoid putting a ferrari or a photo of me skydiving on my about page?! (The answer it turns out is remarkably easy - you just don’t put a skydiving or ferrari photo on the page).But you have to balance that against the personal nature of the work that I do. People aren’t hiring Yes! and… - they’re hiring Tom Critchlow. And people don’t know Yes! and… they know Tom Critchlow. Ron summed this up perfectly:Be yourself, and don't confuse the market.The simpler and more direct I can make my branding, the more genuine it will feel. Ultimately all I need to do is be true to myself (sometimes this is hard to do though!).So, Welcome to tomcritchlow.com V2So after all this - I ripped the design right out of yesand, put a new tomcritchlow.com live and hit publish. Have a poke around! It’s very much a work in progress, in particular there’s plenty more talking about the work that I do that needs to come, but for now it’s a good enough house for me to put it out into the world.In an effort to be more intentional with this new site, I’m doubling down on the following core ideas:  The site must reflect me. That means there’s a photo of my face on the homepage and I talk about the work that I do, but it’s also a little quirky and creative (and green!). And I might meander into art or architecture (or javascript poetry!) from time to time.  In order to get good clients I’m going to need to expose a little more about the work that I do. Look out for a few case studies, and more under the hood posts on my consulting work in the future. For the moment, start here.  It’s valuable to try and build a community. This translates into three things; I’m going to be posting here more regularly, I’ve integrated Disqus comments on the site for more dialogue and I’m launching a newsletter (sign up!).Some ThanksThe lifeblood of a consulting business is the referral network that provides a gravity to attract interesting work and I’ve been inspired by those around me who either have helped me directly or who are building networks of support for independents. Big thanks to Gary Chou, Brian Dell, Kyle Monson, Arnold Waldstein, Jim Babb, Dave Dawson, Luke Chatelain, Dave Minchala, John Doherty, Ron Garrett, Jonathan Libov &amp; Will Critchlow for support, clients, advice and insight along the way.What Do You Think?Part of the intentional focus here is to build a small engaged community so - you tell me! How did I do? What do you think about the new brand? Have you struggled with personal branding? How did you overcome those challenges? Leave a comment below or hit me up on twitter: @tomcritchlow."

  "title": "An alternative to the bullshit industrial complex",
  "url": "/tomcritchlow.com/2016/06/03/bullshit-industrial-complex/",
  "date": "June 3, 2016",
  "content": "I recently read The Creative World’s Bullshit Industrial Complex by Sean Blanda over at 99u. It’s a phenomenal piece on the current state of authority and fame on the web (especially in creative circles).  And most times, when we dig deeper into a specific person’s pitch, his or her purported authority is more of a facade to make them appear authoritative — and any ideas are actually a mosaic of people also trying to appear authoritative in a disconcerting house of cards.I’ve seen this myself many times. But I’ve still fallen into this trap before:  Their interest is not in making the reader’s life any better, it is in building their own profile as some kind of influencer or thought leader. Or, most frustratingly, they all reference the same company case studies (Hello, Apple and Pixar!), the same writers, or the same internet thinkers. I often encounter writers that share “success advice” learned from a blogger who was quoting a book that interviewed a notable prolific person.The modern social mobile web has greased the wheels for every little thought. It’s much easier to retweet someone than to write a unique tweet.Is it truly external vs internal motivation?The one piece I don’t completely agree with Sean on is the idea that this is a zero-sum game between external and internal motivation - yes we should be striving for original unique work but not publishing to the open web cuts off so many opportunities - I’ve had so many wonderful professional and personal interactions because of being visible on the web - in fact I first met Sean because of putting myself out there in the world.A suggestion for how to escapeSean didn’t touch on how to avoid the Complex. I’m not going to tell you how to escape the bullshit industrial complex. I’m not going to write that because that would feed the machine - there’s no black and white here, the issue is nuanced. But perhaps you can treat this as a suggestion? A provocation? Here’s some ways I try and catch myself from falling into the Complex:  Publish, but keep it weird. For example, I love writing blog posts but I try hard to avoid anything that could be classed as “thought leadership” - for example Poetry &amp; Markdown for What? about formatting markdown files for poetry, or A Meander into Architecture about seeing architecture for the very first time.  Post thinking, not answers. For example, a popular post I wrote a few months back Decentralized Brands &amp; The Future of Content Marketing, despite the name is really just me thinking out loud. I wrote in the piece “This is not a fully fleshed out thesis yet but rather some jumping off points.” and as my thinking evolved I included links to other writing I found interesting.  Be humble. I wrote a post about how a side project I’d coded up never really worked properly and the lovely random exchange that happened as a result in Random acts of algorithms.In summary - I believe you should be publishing something to the web, maybe an esoteric spreadsheet, perhaps an open source javascript library, a deep dive into semantic analysis of your favorite author? Who knows? Publish, but keep it weird and humble."

It’s a phenomenal piece on the current state of authority and fame on the web (especially in creative circles).  And most times, when we dig deeper into a specific person’s pitch, his or her purported authority is more of a facade to make them appear authoritative — and any ideas are actually a mosaic of people also trying to appear authoritative in a disconcerting house of cards.I’ve seen this myself many times. But I’ve still fallen into this trap before:  Their interest is not in making the reader’s life any better, it is in building their own profile as some kind of influencer or thought leader. Or, most frustratingly, they all reference the same company case studies (Hello, Apple and Pixar!), the same writers, or the same internet thinkers. I often encounter writers that share “success advice” learned from a blogger who was quoting a book that interviewed a notable prolific person.The modern social mobile web has greased the wheels for every little thought. It’s much easier to retweet someone than to write a unique tweet.Is it truly external vs internal motivation?The one piece I don’t completely agree with Sean on is the idea that this is a zero-sum game between external and internal motivation - yes we should be striving for original unique work but not publishing to the open web cuts off so many opportunities - I’ve had so many wonderful professional and personal interactions because of being visible on the web - in fact I first met Sean because of putting myself out there in the world.A suggestion for how to escapeSean didn’t touch on how to avoid the Complex. I’m not going to tell you how to escape the bullshit industrial complex. I’m not going to write that because that would feed the machine - there’s no black and white here, the issue is nuanced. But perhaps you can treat this as a suggestion? A provocation? Here’s some ways I try and catch myself from falling into the Complex:  Publish, but keep it weird. For example, I love writing blog posts but I try hard to avoid anything that could be classed as “thought leadership” - for example Poetry &amp; Markdown for What? about formatting markdown files for poetry, or A Meander into Architecture about seeing architecture for the very first time.  Post thinking, not answers. For example, a popular post I wrote a few months back Decentralized Brands &amp; The Future of Content Marketing, despite the name is really just me thinking out loud. I wrote in the piece “This is not a fully fleshed out thesis yet but rather some jumping off points.” and as my thinking evolved I included links to other writing I found interesting.  Be humble. I wrote a post about how a side project I’d coded up never really worked properly and the lovely random exchange that happened as a result in Random acts of algorithms.In summary - I believe you should be publishing something to the web, maybe an esoteric spreadsheet, perhaps an open source javascript library, a deep dive into semantic analysis of your favorite author? Who knows? Publish, but keep it weird and humble."

  "content": "The shipping container revolutionized global trade and modern capitalism. Why? Because it standardized infrastructure. This is called intermodalism:  Intermodal freight transport involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (rail, ship, and truck), without any handling of the freight itself when changing modes.With the advent of Facebook Instant Pages1 and Google Accelerated Mobile Pages2 we’re entering an age of intermodal media.John Herrman writes the best new media cricism anywhere on the web in his series the content wars.

Or… strained? In the run-up, Facebook explained Instant Articles as a way to solve a particular problem: articles, which came from websites, were widely shared and read but loaded slowly.

He argues that this might not be exactly what people want but because of the infrastructure (read: platforms) we won’t see so much innovation beyond that:  “So, a thought experiment!

The curiosity gap wouldn’t make sense here, for example. But what would? Would the article just start? Would it assume the native Facebook language of the Personal Update? Or would it demand a more thorough kind of preview—a pre-article that could be scanned and either expanded or not?”Why? Because of intermodal media. It’s not about what’s best - it’s about what is easiest, most transportable and interchangeable across media platforms. There’s a reason, in my mind, why Twitter markup3 and Facebook markup4 are almost identical (but not quite!).

It’s simple: write a blog post, think about who cares about that topic, email it to them asking for their thoughts.That’s it.Sounds too simple right? When was the last time you tried it? Hmm?

You might look at a popular blogger or twitter account and marvel at their weak connections - but the thing that matters is strong connections. And everyone has those.Could be an old boss, a friend, someone you met at a conference - it doesn’t matter. Write something they’d find interesting and email them a thoughtful email. Don’t send more than 5 of these per blog post otherwise I guarantee you’re doing it wrong and spamming people.This is something I use every time I write a blog post - it’s a great routine to get into because it forces you to write a blog post so that at least one person cares about it.Helping my friends blog - 12 weeks at a timeSo when I looked around and realized that I’m not blogging frequently, and neither are many of my close friends I decided to do something about it. 5 minutes later I had a Trello board live and sent out a call on Twitter and an email.The result?Me and 10 friends in a shared Trello board with the shared goal of publishing one post a week each for the next 12 weeks.The first posts are starting to roll in for week 1:  Chris Carella wrote #NYCblogclub  Chris Kennedy wrote “Follow your Passion”I’m going to be learning as I go about feedback loops and goal setting but one thing’s for sure: we should all blog more.–A debt of gratitude is owed to Gary Chou for building wonderful feedback loops through his Orbital program.

What would Google Photos for Work look like?Imagine the following use-case:  Tommy owns a construction company and his company is renovating a new hotel in downtown Manhattan. The project is complex and sprawling - what tools can he use to better keep an eye on and manage the project? Google Photos for Work. He signs up with his Google Apps account and all of his construction workers on their phones can download a special Google Camera for Work app. As workers take photos across the project using this app all of the photos appear in a central storage stream automatically. Not only do they appear automatically but all of the photos are searchable by location, date and so on. The real magic however is when machine learning does its thing - then Tommy, sat in HQ can ask Google for “photos of the rear windows when it’s raining” to automatically see what it looks like and see how the sealant is holding up. Or - “photos of the first floor only” to get a handle on progress in a particular area.Wouldn’t that be neat?A few things to note:  Clearly you wouldn’t be limited to human-powered cameras, CCTV, dropcams (which Google owns!), drones with cameras, etc would all be archived in the cloud  Domain specific learning would be very interesting, if Google can sell this Google Photos for Work to enough hospitals for example, how long before Google begins to understand what is an artery, what is a vein, what’s “normal” and what’s wrong?  Once you have domain-specific knowledge, then a worker out in the field (whether that’s construction or medicine) could take a photo and ask a query - “Google does this rash look infected?”What world does this usher in?I forget the exact quote but I think it was Larry who said a few years ago that machine learning was one of the few technologies that he was worried about giving away. The implications worried him. What about now? Has the world changed sufficiently? Might we be ok with a business signing up for Google Photos for Work and getting perhaps millions of images categorized and tagged by facial recognition?–Anyway, food for thought.Disclaimer: I worked at Google between 2012-2014.

  "content": "What do we learn from looking at the world around us?I built a tool to look at all the Instagram photos taken near where I live. The feed looks very different from what the stream of photos from my filtered followers suggests….Technically it’s just a feed of instagram photos taken within 400 yards of where I live which includes parts or Boerum Hill and Gowanus in Brooklyn, but in reality it’s kitchens, playgrounds and commutes of people who live around me but never show up in the mediated maps of Facebook and Instagram.One of the most rewarding habits I try to cultivate is to look more closely at the world around me, but looking is an old habit. I wanted to build a digital tool that lets me look at the world around me in a new way, and give me a new lens.See for yourself here: tomcritchlow.com/instagram/This is really just the tip of the iceberg in the broader conversation about how we become human beings on and with and using the internet. You realize that the act of following is also the act of excluding - how can we build new inclusions? Sometimes it’s important to change your filter to think in new ways about how “place”, “people” and “communities” work.The plumbingBehind the scenes, here’s how I built it:Firstly - the data gets pulled into a spreadsheet using Google Scripts and refreshed every 5 minutes (see the code in a gist here).Then - I publish that spreadsheet (see it here).Lastly - I use tabletop.js to display the last 50 photos visually (see the front end code here).Digital ResearchA higher resolution map of the spaces we inhabit, whether target audiences or physical neighborhoods, lets us find more opportunity for finding real problems, understanding real lives and engaging with communities in real, meaningful ways.I’m thinking more closely about research projects - if you’re curious about using digital tools to unearth stories and insights about the real world get in touch. I’d love to talk.–Footnote:There is a certain feeling of overstepping boundaries that comes with gathering people’s photos like this. This is powered by a single Instagram API call from public photos but that sidesteps the fact that most of these photos were not intended to be broadcast to the public but rather to be semi-private to their personal network. As a consequence I doubt I’ll leave this tool running for long (and if you are reading this and want your photo removed please email me and I’ll take it down immediately: tjcritchlow@gmail.com)–Thanks to Brian Dell for helping me with the initial draft of this post."

I wanted to build a digital tool that lets me look at the world around me in a new way, and give me a new lens.See for yourself here: tomcritchlow.com/instagram/This is really just the tip of the iceberg in the broader conversation about how we become human beings on and with and using the internet. You realize that the act of following is also the act of excluding - how can we build new inclusions? Sometimes it’s important to change your filter to think in new ways about how “place”, “people” and “communities” work.The plumbingBehind the scenes, here’s how I built it:Firstly - the data gets pulled into a spreadsheet using Google Scripts and refreshed every 5 minutes (see the code in a gist here).Then - I publish that spreadsheet (see it here).Lastly - I use tabletop.js to display the last 50 photos visually (see the front end code here).Digital ResearchA higher resolution map of the spaces we inhabit, whether target audiences or physical neighborhoods, lets us find more opportunity for finding real problems, understanding real lives and engaging with communities in real, meaningful ways.I’m thinking more closely about research projects - if you’re curious about using digital tools to unearth stories and insights about the real world get in touch. I’d love to talk.–Footnote:There is a certain feeling of overstepping boundaries that comes with gathering people’s photos like this. This is powered by a single Instagram API call from public photos but that sidesteps the fact that most of these photos were not intended to be broadcast to the public but rather to be semi-private to their personal network. As a consequence I doubt I’ll leave this tool running for long (and if you are reading this and want your photo removed please email me and I’ll take it down immediately: tjcritchlow@gmail.com)–Thanks to Brian Dell for helping me with the initial draft of this post."

I like to use tools in ways that they were not intended to be used. And my favorite swiss-army-knife toolkit is Google Slides. Running my art business Fiercely Curious my partner and I often find ourselves need to think visually between us and Google Slides is hands down the best tool.For example — we recently ran a pop-up gallery show which required making our own floorplans of the space and figuring out the layout and curation of the artworks in the show. Oh — and being able to collaborate on this in real time and access it from our phones is just a nice extra. Here’s the Google Doc we created to curate the show:Our collaborative Google Doc for planning an art gallery curation.Turns out this curated layout was crucial to figuring out how many artworks we could hang, how it would look and more. Here’s the final result — the pop-up gallery in real life:How the gallery curation looked in real life.Ok — how does this work? I’ll teach you my secrets:Step by Step Guide To Using Google Slides as a free, fast illustrator productOk — there’s two things you need to know in order to use Google Slides as anillustrator product:1) Resize the canvas to be pixel basedThe first trick you need to learn is that the canvas in Google Slides can bere-sized. Under the file menu choose and page setup and then in the dialog —choose to size the canvas by pixels:How do you think I made this little image? I’ll give you one guess…2) Save as PNGThe second trick you need to learn is that you can save any slide as a PNG file(or JPG if that floats your boat). Also under the file menu:If you haven’t figured out how I’m making these graphics yet, you haven’t been paying attention…Use it for Wireframes and MockupsUsing the above tricks — resizing our canvas to a new pixel dimension — Icreated a 2000 x 4000 pixel canvas to design and prototype new site designs:An initial layout for Fiercely Curious — check out how close this is to the final site: http://www.fiercelycurious.com/And Easy Image CollagesNot only that though — it’s actually remarkably effective for creating imagesfor the web. For example — how would you make this image without firing upPhotoshop and futzing for 15 mins?Easy! This takes two seconds in Google Docs:Alright — I cheated on this one, I had to use gifmaker here.Try it for yourself!Try it for yourself! Remember that image I showed at the top of the post? Here’sa link to a public Google Doc. Just select file -&gt; make a copy to save a versionthat you can play around with.Here’s a link to your very own 500px x 500px canvasA few closing thoughtsOk, before the design community starts leaving me hate mail there’s a few thingsto point out. Firstly — this is not a terribly robust solution. I’m sure thereare plenty of things you can’t do using Google Docs (gradients for example!).And, you can’t use fancy font weights (please fix this Google!).EDIT: It’s 2017 and font weights are now available in Google Docs! Hooray!Oh — and working with very large images will randomly crash your tab.And who knows how long Google will support this?Well — in response to all of those, maybe some day I’ll spring for a $9.99 /month subscription for Photoshop that I don’t know how to use but for my limiteddesign skills and rapid iteration projects it works just fine.Comments?

This is not a fully fleshed out thesis yet but rather some jumping off points.Back in 2012 I wrote a post talking about the convergence of SEO and Content Marketing - in it I was making the relatively tame assertion that brands would become the web’s biggest publishers.But the question I forgot to ask was what kind of publishers would they become? Would it look more like the New York Times or more like BuzzFeed?Let’s look at a few trends in the media world.Firstly - the homepage is dying:  The New York Times lost 80 million homepage visitors—half the traffic to the nytimes.com page—in two years. source.And, native ads might be a pretty big deal - in fact they may be the dominant form of advertising online (if you squint a little):  In the nine months the native ad program was available during 2014, Upworthy said it generated more than $10 million in revenue for the publisher. source.If you mix the above two ingredients together you arrive at BuzzFeed distributed - not just the death of the homepage, but the death of the website!

Stuid and beautiful by Ben Pieratt  Once upon a time a vulture had no name, the eagle too. A vulture is no eagle but its hardly a vulture either. So it is with us. We’re neither animal nor mineral nor behavior nor dictionary. You are you, stupid and smart, beautiful and awful, 100% the truth of yourself, no matter what anyone Says.My god - this is beautiful, heartbreaking writing in 12 short paragraphs from Ben Pieratt. Ben - I love you and want to hug you. I’m terrible at money and taxes too."

Her book is available on Amazon: Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden AgesI was introduced to Carlotta by a friend Miles Grimshaw who let me know about Carlotta being a strong influencer for Fred Wilson and USV. See more on Fred’s post about lineage.The cycle of technological revolutionsCarlotta talks about the cycle of new technological revolutions as follows.First comes the rapid growth as new technological infrastructure is put in place. This phase is funded by financial capital derived from speculation. This phase is called the Installation Period.This frenzy ultimately leads to a crash as the bubble bursts.Then starts the real growth and “golden age” as the infrastructure built in the installation period becomes cheaper, more accessible and more universal. This phase is funded by production capital derived from profits and is called the Deployment Period.This diagram sums up the installation and deployment periods well:The 5 major technology revolutionsCarlotta lays out the five major technological revolutions as outlined in this diagram:Predicting the 6th revolutionWhile we’re living in the “golden age” of the current information revolution it’s never too soon to start speculating on what the 6th major technological disruption might be and how it might play out. What follows is purely conjecture and an exercise in thinking critically. I welcome feedback, disagreement, discussion and analysis.AI &amp; Robotics as the 6th revolutionWe’re right at the beginning of the installation period for AI &amp; robotics. I summarized a few of the key events in the tech space that hopefully give you a flavor of how seriously this is being taken: But where does this trend lead? What happens next? Here’s a rough timeline I dreamed up:2010 - 2020: Beginning of build out and research applications enabled by the previous golden age of information technology. Cloud computing, global networks, processing, quantum computers etc.2020 - 2025: Installation of robots in both the home and industry ramps up very quickly. A smart assistant in every pocket. A roomba in every house. A robot arm in every factory. Our jobs start being replaced by robots and algorithms.2025 - 2030: The global economy crashes. Hard. Youth unemployment has been rising steadily for the last decade and reaches a tipping point sparking a global meltdown. The global job market shrinks to an unsustainable point.2030 - 2040: Global prosperity and an overhaul of the economic system. There aren’t enough jobs left for all the people so new economic paradigm is born - global consumerism is essentially killed off, the idea of working for a living dies and we see a much more sustainable future driven by different kinds of value creation for society and ideas like universal basic income become mainstream.Isn’t this just the singularity?Well, Google did hire Ray Kurzweil but no - this isn’t about the singularity. The singularity is scheduled for 2047 but I believe we will experience a widespread technological revolution driven by AI and robotics well before we reach true human-level artificial intelligence. The singularity is about the tipping point where computers get smarter than humans - I’m talking about computers getting smart enough to replace our jobs.Whither Google Buses?Are we seeing a glimmer in the eye of the global consciousness with the Google bus protests? Do these protests and others like them speak to a growing dissatisfaction with the incumbents?And importantly, how might we soften the impact of the next boom/bust revolution? Perhaps by building economics early that model the next era - i.e. universal basic income, value creation beyond “hours worked”, distributed economies and cultivating human skills.AlternativesObviously I’ve just made all of that up - so there’s clearly alternatives out there. The whole point about these revolutions is that no one sees them coming… So what else might there be? Here’s a few ideas:      Global warming just fucks everything right up and there is no 6th technological revolution (or we have bigger things to worry about at least)        An energy revolution is actually more profound - free/cheap/sustainable energy sources might drive a technological revolution distinct from the AI+robotics one        Biotech. I don’t know much about nanotech and wetware but there’s definitely potential for massive disruption to come from biotech, life form creation, and so on.        Something else. As Miles was kind enough to point out when I sent this post to him for review - AI and robotics feels like an extension of the information age and not a new paradigm. So maybe we all end up ruled by robots but there’s another different revolution going on that we all miss…  I’d love to chat with you about your ideas. Disagree? Have interesting data to share?

It didn’t sell out.Still, the heliocentric model for the solar system would cause quite an upset when it was championed by Galileo almost 100 years later. Galileo was imprisoned in 1633 under house arrest for “following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of Holy Scripture”In the margin of the original manuscript Copernicus doodled a little meteor:SourceOf what significance the doodle we shall never know.I first learned about Copernicus’ doodle many years ago in a documentary by Marcus du Sautoy - the beauty of diagrams. But it wasn’t until I recently read Robin Sloan’s Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore that I thought to look up the doodle. It turns out very little had been written about it that I could find using Google. So I went on a digital adventure and eventually unearthed a copy of the original manuscript online here.Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore is a wonderful story that touches on the real and imagined, digital and physical, archived and lost, serious and playful.Somehow reading the book tickled my neurons in a way that made me go on a hunt to track down a doodle in a book that’s 500 years old. Doesn’t get much better than that…."

  "content": "In 1543 Copernicus published De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in which he reasoned that the Earth orbits the Sun. 400 copies were printed. It didn’t sell out.Still, the heliocentric model for the solar system would cause quite an upset when it was championed by Galileo almost 100 years later. Galileo was imprisoned in 1633 under house arrest for “following the position of Copernicus, which is contrary to the true sense and authority of Holy Scripture”In the margin of the original manuscript Copernicus doodled a little meteor:SourceOf what significance the doodle we shall never know.I first learned about Copernicus’ doodle many years ago in a documentary by Marcus du Sautoy - the beauty of diagrams. But it wasn’t until I recently read Robin Sloan’s Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore that I thought to look up the doodle. It turns out very little had been written about it that I could find using Google. So I went on a digital adventure and eventually unearthed a copy of the original manuscript online here.Mr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore is a wonderful story that touches on the real and imagined, digital and physical, archived and lost, serious and playful.Somehow reading the book tickled my neurons in a way that made me go on a hunt to track down a doodle in a book that’s 500 years old. Doesn’t get much better than that…."

We do not publish photographs of completed work, only renderings: drawings, collage, models and graphics of all sorts. Our source materials are (mostly) out-of-print academic and trade journals. We cull the most striking, typical and atypical images from thousands of pages of print that will not be available online. As the internet increasingly becomes the main source for designers to draw on precedence, RNDRD hopes to provide a broader sample of the history of architectural image making.source: [About | RNDRD](https://rndrd.com/about)->Once cities were designed to accommodate the masses; today the masses have to be seduced. During the past forty years, like all sectors of the economy, urban planning has become free enterprise: a perpetually speculative activity, which must give shape to developments even if it remains uncertain whether those developments will ever happen, or attract the people for whom they were planned.> This presentation explores the flipside: large urban plans that were built but never used. These now occur on every continent – the inevitable fallout of a world urbanizing at a staggering pace. But perhaps they are more… perhaps these towns also constitute compelling reasons for reflection in the face of a seemingly unbreakable consensus that the city is our one and only common future.source: [Reinier de Graaf, “Phantom Urbanism” - Harvard Graduate School of Design](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/event/reinier-de-graaf-phantom-urbanism/)--[Google streetview examples of architecture styles](https://modern-architecture.glitch.me/)--[Ways of knowing cities](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/books/reader/483-ways-of-knowing-cities)--"

We investigated blogging as a form of personal communication and expression, with a specific interest in uncovering the range of motivations driving individuals to create and maintain blogs.source: -->For some reason I’m thinking of what Carrie Fisher once said in an interview: “Take your broken heart, and turn it into art.” I suppose that the equivalent for me would be “take your broken heart, and turn it into a book about design systems.” Or better yet: “take your broken heart and blog.”source: [Take your broken heart and blog ･ Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/take-your-broken-heart-and-blog)-->A while ago I created a Python script that threw a chunk of my blog posts into Are.na.

The difficulty and monotony and odd joy of getting better at something. Groggy morning runs. Loving yourself fully and expecting that same standard of love from other people—because God, self-loathing is boring. People who make completely different choices than I do and have completely different values, but are nevertheless very happy. How they think about meaning. The ecology of our changing planet and the adjustments we'll have to make to adapt and survive. Navigating objectification, and learned self-objectification, in a society that places great value on female beauty and youth. How to communicate clearly and kindly in high-stakes situations. Technology and its effect on productivity. Strange possible worlds. Fear, vulnerability, loss of control. Surprising statistical truths. Small things that give me joy: the smell of lemon, rain and freshly-cut wood, un-sexualized intimacy, inventive and engaging movies, children in motion. Attempting to live a less self-serving moral life.Source: [How to write and what to write about](https://reading.supply/@ava/how-to-write-and-what-to-write-about-from-12-28-2018-W4o1Sb) by @readingsupply"

Highly recommended if you’re fascinated by cities; its expansive, wandering style, crawling along the stones and streets of imagined cities like fingers stroking Braille, reminded me of Sohrab Sepehri’s The Lover is Always Alone, which is one of my favorite books of all time.The housekeeper and the professorAlways coming homeThe club of queer trades–Good source of books here: my years of readinghttps://rogerstrunk.com/library–Train dreams recommended by Robin Sloan–Tons of good sci-fi reccs in this threadIncluding:The Dazzle of Day, by Molly Gloss–The Art of Community (Spencer Heath MacCallum): I’ve been looking for reading about commercial buildings as microcosmic “cities” and finally found this book, published in 1970, through a friend. Within the first few pages, I wanted to reach across the fifty-year divide and clasp hands with the author. MacCallum asks, “Is a hotel a community?” and proceeds to explore the idea of “proprietary communities”, such as shopping malls, airplanes, and RV parks, where unaffiliated individuals are bound by the contracts they make to the proprietor of an organization. MacCallum argues that sovereignty (or “institutionalized force”) is merely an awkward transition between “primitive” and proprietary communities, both of which represent the true best form of social organization. (Unsurprisingly, his grandfather was an ex-Georgist.) I didn’t agree with everything in this book, but it left me with a lot of good questions. It made me think about the ways in which big tech companies are also proprietary communities (consider the recent WIRED piece about Google’s internal culture!). It also gave me some missing vocabulary I’ve needed to express how one-to-many communities are structured differently from many-to-many communities (ex. an open source maintainer is often a sole proprietor who allocates scarce resources, like attention, on behalf of all contributors). I desperately want to talk to someone about this book; it looks like I snagged the last copy on Amazon, but it’s also available via Internet Archive here. Perhaps one day some kind soul will republish this book and give it the love it deserves.from here–https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-City-Oppositions-Books/dp/0262680432/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=https://monoskop.org/images/1/16/Rossi_Aldo_The_Architecture_of_the_City_1982_OCR_parts_missing.pdf–The Future of Another Timeline–Thrilling Cities by Ian Fleming–https://www.amazon.com/Night-Heron-Adam-Brookes/dp/0316273090  This week, I finished the third in the trilogy by Adam Burkes that begins with Night Heron, continues into Spy Games, and concludes with The Spy’s Daughter, and I can report to you that they are the best spy novels I’ve read in years.

This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin’s power to shapeshift,[note 1] on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells.source: Merlin - Wikipedia–A universal theory of BusinessMagikMerlin was the OG consultantOf kings and queens and consultants (and mages and jesters)Business functions like a monarchyThere’s a reason we talk about samurai and freelancersSkills of the mage (consultant):  Scrying  Soothsaying  Truth-telling  Divination  Spells  Wisdom–“Ideas about a person’s place in society, his role, lifestyle, and ego qualities will lose their hold as the cohesive forces in society disintegrate.

This was a client of mine, I’d been working out of their office 3 or 4 days a week for two months as their interim VP of marketing. Sooner than expected they found someone to come on board full time and that was the end of my engagement.I’m dramatizing slighlty but the insight is true - there’s a gap between consulting and in-house work. It’s often postioned as an either/or choice when in fact the truth is more nuanced. Most of my consulting engagements should naturally end in me hiring someone to continue the work and processes that I’ve helped to set up.After all, strategy without execution is worthless.The Lightbulb MomentThe second half of 2015 I landed on a new client. After an initial workshop I walked out the door with a clear vision that they needed to hire -  needed to build a new marketing team to support the kind of growth they wanted. So I got stuck in. I believed in the company I was working with, thought they had a great team already and they paid well. I reached out to my network to help find the right people for them.This engagement helped me realize a few key things:  Building a marketing org is hard if you don’t have any marketing leadership already  Hiring itself is a skill and a lot of young companies are not good at it  There is a lot of value in a network and reputation built up in the industryWhich leads me to my current new mission:I help mid-size startups solve marketing problems and build marketing teams by providing strategy and connecting them to marketing talent.How I Got HereI started my career in SEO - the nuts and bolts of keywords, analytics, link building and content. I came to New York in 2011 with Distilled, to open a new office and build a new outpost for the company. Looking for something new I jumped to Google for a couple of years where I worked with the Creative Lab. In late 2014 I went out on my own to build an art business with Erin and start my path as an independent.The past year and a bit I’ve spent consulting. Mostly marketing consulting, sometimes SEO consulting. I had high hopes for the kind of work I’d be able to get out of the gate and the lesson learned in 2015 is that spreading your wings is like growing a flower - consistent, slow, deliberate work. But sped up over a timelapse it’s incredble to see the range of motion and the amount accomplished.Why Recruitment?Why am I going to be good at this?  I have a strong network of diverse people across startups, marketing and tech.  A deep expertise in marketing allows me to truly understand both the problems a client is facing and the kinds of people who will be good at working on those problems.  I’ve done a lot of hiring over the yearsNBED more here.Consultant vs Recruiter?Every mid-stage startup in NY is looking for a head of marketing these days... and almost none of them know what they&#39;re looking for.&mdash; chris muscarella (@cm) December 30, 2015This tweet is true - though a little strongly worded in my opinon. There are lots of things that mid-stage startups don’t know what they’re doing! That’s the fun of it. But it’s true - marketing and growth are abstract concepts for a lot of mid-size startups. They’ve not yet defined all of the inputs and outputs and haven’t figured out processes. So they look for someone to lead them through the answers to these questions and to build a team.But these are two different things.It’s important not to choose too soon. I’m obviously biased but a good consultant can still get deep in the weeds and help you think about problems in different ways while providing incredibly fast execution and a flexible approach. A lot of my work this past year has been on-site with clients, embedded with teams and helping to add advice but more importantly help show my client how I think, how I approach problems and provide some experience about what works and what doesn’t while recognizing that each problem needs a fresh pair of eyes and an open mind.In short, just because you’re struggling with growth doesn’t mean that hiring a “VP of growth” will solve your problems. Often, founders feel like they don’t have the marketing experience or knowledge to manage and lead a marketing team. But for the most part that’s not true - yes as the company grows hiring a manager to lead the team makes sense but to think they’ll solve all of your growth issues is naive.Here are some things to consider before hiring a full VP marketing:  A workshop with the leadership to figure out marketing goals, objectives and activities. Often there are plenty of things that are known to be worth doing but just haven’t been done yet. That doesn’t need an expensive VP marketing, that needs doers. People who can execute with a bit of experience.  Working with an agency to execute some specific deliverables - the nice thing about a lot of agencies is that you get access to a wide range of talent, ideas and experience. Work with the agency on the specific deliverables but don’t forget that they’ve seen a ton of different clients and know what works and what doesn’t.  Working with a consultant to come in-house and sit with your team, especially if you have a junior team that can learn from having someone physically present.(Spoiler alert: I can help you do all of the above! Who said this was an unbiased blog post eh?)The 18 Month MistakeJust quite how bad is it to make a mistake with your head of marketing? Back of the envelope math says something like:  3 months bedding in  3 months of work in the wrong direction or on the wrong things  3 months of extrication, pain and eventually termination of contractThat puts you 9 months in the hole. But then there’s the opportunity cost - you’re now 9 months behind where you would be if you’d hired the right person! Who would about now be 6 months into working on the right things and building the right way. Oh, and it’s going to take you 3 months to find the right person and bring them in after this mess.All of which is to say that hiring is important, delicate and sometimes the benefit of hiring a consultant is that you can stay agile while still getting some forward progress.Some Guiding PrinciplesHiring is serious work. The concepts of work, money, employment and health insurance are not to be joked about. I’ve been involved in hiring people of both genders, many races and diverse backgrounds. But there’s more to be done. I’m just starting out but here’s a few things I think are important:  Equality - spend more time working with and supporting women, minorities and those without a priviliged background.  Longterm thinking work with candidates and companies beyond the inital hiring.  Education educate companies on best practices for hiring and treating candidates fairly and kindly.  Human recruiting be kind and considerate to all involved, no spam.Basically - give a shit about the people and treat everyone with respect. This means getting involved well before and beyond just the moment of hiring. I’ve been involved in building positive cultures when I work in-house, what does this look like inSo get in touch!The magic always happens over coffee doesn’t it? Let’s chat.

No one around the table knew SEO as well as I did, but they sure did have strong opinions.A question would arise about the cost of doing link building. An exchange might go something like this:Consultant: We need to know how much it costs to build a link for our financial modelsMe: Ok, first we have to have a discussion about the kind of links we want to buildConsultant:Meanwhile, over lunch in the cafeteria one of the in-house SEO folks turned to me covertly and showed me xrumer - a piece of desktop software that builds thousands of links through automated submissions and so on.Not only was Xrumer theConsulting Is ImprovGood Consulting is Improv Without the BullshitYou could also call this codified experience.

When you’re trying to make change it’s important to understand what kind of change you’re looking for and choosing the appropriate tool for the job. Pretty much everything I know about effective consulting I learned from my brother and he wrote a nice piece on better business documents where he outlines the pyramid of documents.I always try and follow this model and will switch between formats and medium often during a consulting engagement depending on the work. For example - here’s a taste of the range of work produced during a single client engagement (some work I did for the New York Times Cooking site a few years back)          This is largely because I used the term ‘consulting’ when I was doing client work at the agency Distilled pre-Google.               .This can be helpful - especially if you explicitly take the time to really think through who your audience is for a given recommendation and think about what medium will suit it best (sometimes multiple mediums!).But this is only scratching the surface.The New Consultant’s Toolkit - Mockups &amp; PrototypesWhile the above framework is useful, recently I’ve found that I can be far more effective by getting closer to the output. What do I mean by that? Well - documents are almost never the actual output we’re looking for. Usually we’re looking for teams to be hired, or landing pages to be made or videos to be shot etc.Imagine we were trying to convince Etsy to allow videos within product listings. One piece of the puzzle might involve a simple screenshot faked up using inspect element:The modern web is such a remixable medium that I urge you to think how you can build an MVP or prototype of the change you’re recommending. The most simple way to do this is using inspect element in chrome to change up a site and then take a screenshot. Being able to see language, design and formats in play within the very medium we’re discussing can be very effective. Here’s a screenshot of a prototype I built for a client to demonstrate an idea:There are a million different tools to generate mockups and prototypes (which is the beauty!) but my goto tools are:  Chrome’s inspect element for small changes and tweaks (protip you can take mobile mockups this way too using the device switcher, and even add a device frame to the screenshot too)  Google slides for mockups and more design-focused work. Read more about how I do that here.  Glitch for functioning prototypes andThis approach will help you get closer to producing recommendations and ideas that resemble the finished product, that’s a good thing. But it still doesn’t answer the central question - who are we trying to convince, and what objections do they have?"

    "content": "I have room for one or two more clients in 2018. The conventional wisdom is that you distil your experience into a tightly crafted positioning statement. A tidy little zen koan on the work you do and who you do it for.This view of the world however is tightly constraining. It doesn’t account for different modes of work with the same client. Or an evolving skillset over time. So instead I’ve written 10,000 words exploring the landscape and the work.I chose the word landscape to emphasize the idea of surveying the terrain - looking out from a small rise and seeing which rivers and streams seem most fruitful. Of course the map is not the territory.And the work - the craft - is the heart of the work. As an independent this work can be varied in nature. From interim CMO to strategic advisor and trusted advisor.How I Got HereLet’s first take a quick pass at how I got here.SEO had a moment where an SEO agency could dictate overall digital stratetgy. While that’s still true for a subset of organizations where organic search is dominant (not just large but dominant). But in 2011 for example you could have meaningful conversations with a company like GucciBut in 2018? If SEO is your business - as an agency or consultant - then I think to remain strategically relevant you need to either expand your horizons or double down on helping those companies where search is a dominant channel.So I took a leap, went to work for Google. Shifted my thinking into a wider brand, org, user insights Unfortunately instead I decided to write 10,000 words on the work vectors I’m interested in right now, how I got here and where I’m going next. I’ve told it through the lens of three tensions. Brand/Publisher, Strategy/Implementation and Consultant/Advisor.The Media &lt;–&gt; Brand ContinuumI’ve been a consultant for four years now and you can basically summarize my work by looking at the Brand/Media spectrum and realizing that I help companies push one way or the other.[Diagram of brand &lt;–&gt; Media]On the left hand of this spectrum you have “brands” - what I’m calling traditional businesses. People like Olapic (a B2B saas platform) or Fundera (a B2B small business lending platform). People with a product. On the right hand of the spectrum you have media companies - folks like The New York Times or Complex Media. These folks don’t have a product but rather content is their product.Content/Product. Is the content the product or the marketing?However, in the middle of the spectrum you have some interesting weird middle ground businesses - typically affiliate businesses. They produce content at scale (sometimes outpacing traditional publishers) and monetize in new and interesting ways. Companies like Nerdwallet or The Wirecutter.What brands wantNon-media company businesses are often:  Narrative poor  Purpose poor  Distribution poor  My work involves helping companies connect their brand and their purpose, often internallyWhat media companies wantMedia companies are often:  Lacking branding  Devoid of user insights  Revenue poorMy work here involvesWhat affiliate businesses wantUsually a mix of the above - better narrative, better brand, better insight into their users.The Brand/Media EcosystemIt’s an interesting ecosystem right now where brands and publishers are increasingly looking like each other. The New York Times boughtWe’ll see:Acquisiitons - so publishers buying brands and, more likely, brands buying publishers. This will take even more of a leap of faith than The NYT buying the Wirecutter but it’ll make sense. Ringfence the editorial teams but integrate the content product into the core brand product.Ecommerce - brands going D2C, publishers creating products and merch. Influencers creating merch.What do I do here? Help everyone act like the others.Strategy &lt;–&gt; Implementation continuumThe secondWorkshops as ways of seeing. Radically challenging existing beliefs and mental models within an organization.The implementation of strategy is slow and messy. It often involves hiring and building teams.Strategy work is an unfolding network of associations. How can you create working environments that reflect that? Workshops. Off-sites. Ethnographic sessions. Bringing users into work.Case study: FInsights &lt;–&gt; Tactics BalanceInsights and execution are a tightly coupled dance. Yin and Yang.Consultant &lt;–&gt; Advisor ContinuumThe third tension to explore here is the consultant/advisor spectrum.Often clients engage with you around a defined problem and end up sticking around to help with undefined work. Connecting to agencies and other service providers. Coaching on mental models. Strategy sparring sessions. Emotional regulation. Ways of seeing.I like to think.2018 is all about weaving through these tensions. Brand/Publisher, Strategy/Implementation, Consultant/Coach. Every engagement spans different spaces here."

    "content": "https://www.amazon.com/Geography-Nowhere-Americas-Man-Made-Landscape/dp/0671888250Rem Koolhaas provided context for modern space - for modern living - in his 2002 essay Junkspace. In the essay Rem provides a glimpse of the flattening, commercializing and colonizing of space:  “Junkspace is post-existential; it makes you uncertain where you are, obscures where you go, undoes where you were.”Airports, air conditioning and aesthetics crash into each other to create a nothing-everything space that sprawls, and subsumes our physical environment.Koolhaas uses the airport as the first spaces to become Junkspace. Out of time and out of place, the airport becomes everywhere and nowhere.In his essay Welcome to Airspace Kyle Chayka sees the bridge between the digital and physical, noting that digital technologies are re-shaping the world around us:  We could call this strange geography created by technology “AirSpace.” It’s the realm of coffee shops, bars, startup offices, and co-live / work spaces that share the same hallmarks everywhere you go: a profusion of symbols of comfort and quality, at least to a certain connoisseurial mindset.In other words, the Junkspace of airports has become the Airspace of everywhere. Commoditized comfort. CBD-cozy.But technology is not satisfied with the “connoisseurial” spaces of coffee shops, airports, restaurants, hotels and bars. Technology is eating the world and it’s hungry.Our experience of space is transforming once again - because every space now is a dual-space. Wherever we are, we are also in digital space. Our physical space - junkspace - airspace - is now just a backdrop for an equivalent junk-digital-space. The airport, once bastion of large bright shared screens is now just a row of seats with faces slumped into our personal screens.Every physical space is now secondary - there is no physical space left that is the primary place we are. We are always primarily in digital space and secondarily in physical space.Yes, physical space has been conquered.The world is being terraformed - not by physical changes in space (like junkspace and airspace) but by replacing space itself. Space has been replaced with digital space, and digital space is nothing but feeds as far as the eye can scroll. Junkfeeds.From Junkspace to JunkfeedsHow do we understand where we are in digital space? How do we orient ourselves?The answer, in 2019 is feeds. Every commercialized, flattened, colonized part of digital space is now a feed - junk-feeds. Junkfeeds.Once confined to Times Square this bright, flashing, garish, predatory environment has extended through our screens into every single moment in time and space. At home on your phone at 11pm? Slouched in the dark over your screen there is a times square in your face. Garish, bright, loud, flashing.Junkfeeds scroll endlessly in front of us. Disorientating us. Destabalizing our sense of oursleves and our sense of the world.In this way, junkspace has been digitized and replaced by the screens in our hands. From Junkspace to Junkfeeds.Junkfeeds are post-human, radical, tech-utopias that pollute our knowledge and police our information.Once recognized as the great frontier of architecture and modernism, junkspace is now just space. It has been fed into the machine and overrun by junkfeeds.The architecture and space of Junkspace will get “better” - fewer screens, tastefully designed. Because junkspace is no longer junkspace it’s just space. Background space. The star of the show is Junkfeeds.Quote from here? https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/the-city-is-my-homescreen-317673e0f57aThe most well-known starchitect should be Zuckerburg.Orienting in digital space via the feedThe problem started because digital space has no edges. Craigmod writes:  Edges are about feeling as much as seeing. With edges comes a sense of weight. And with that comes the ability to feel — physically and psychically. And with that, a better understanding of what we’ve built and where we’ve been.https://craigmod.com/journal/digital_physical/This can be re-framed as the lack of edges: Edgelessness is about lack of feeling and not seeing. Without edges is a sense of weightlessness - the loss of ability to feel physically and emotionally.Digital edge-less spaces creates a lack of feeling and a disorientation.The answer to this is the feed: a way for us to reorient ourselves around something. Not around an edge of “space” (because digital space is infinite) but around the edge of “time”. By orienting everything around the feed of objects sorted by time we regain some logic - some sense of an “edge”. The edge of time.The reverse-chronological-feed created a logic in infinite space to orient by. An edge-like structure.Feeds drained of humansThe reverse-chronological-feed began on blogs. Websites that required effort to update, posted via RSS that created slow-moving chunks of information.Technology and platforms upended it. As technology becomes quicker, boot-less, always-on, always-with-us screens became the norm at the same time that platforms began coopting the feeds as their own.As platforms commercialized it was inevitable that they recognize the power in making us feel disorientated.Facebook was the first - accelerating the feeds (add your entire phone book!). We began to stuff our feeds with junk - the sources which used to be the selected, slow-moving websites became the mass-selected faces of everyone we’ve ever met (and plenty we have never met).The feed is crammed with more sources, that are able to post ever smaller chunks, to devices that we check increasingly often.It quickly becomes apparent to the platforms that these reverse-chronological feeds are no longer working.Facebook is the first to blink - they move to the “news feed” that is algorithmically ranked and ordered.The feed - once oriented around time - becomes disorienting. Where once there was a logic there is quicksand - no way to know or be sure of anything or anyone. Why this piece of content? Why now? What am I not seeing?This is the moment that feeds began to become junkfeeds. With the logic removed the platforms are free to accelerate the disorientation.But even algorithmically curated feeds are not fast enough. Platforms need to remove humans entirely from the process to keep up with our insatiable appetite.Google was the first major platform to completely break this - the Google Discover Feed (which shows up on the homescreen of Android phon and the start page on Chrome) is now entirely divorced from humans. No longer is content presented to you because you asked for it, or because someone you know shared it, or because someone you know interacted with it, just… because Google said so.  “Junkspace is often described as a space of flows, but that is a misnomer; flows depend on disciplined movement, bodies that cohere. Junkspace is a web without spider; although it is an architecture of the masses, each trajectory is strictly unique.”A web without spider!This quote about junkspace sums up junkfeeds - feeds are just flows of information! But they depend on coherent information, checks and balances. Junkfeeds have no checks and balances (or at least none that make sense). They are flows without discipline - flows without thinking. Information that does not cohere. Incoherent shouting.And junkfeeds are personal. Everyone gets their own personal junkfeed - in fact every user gets their own set of junkfeeds. One on Google, one on Facebook, and on and on.This suggested content feed is the true, purest Junkfeed. Not because it’s the worst - but architecturally it’s the most pure. No pretension of humans. There never were humans here. Based entirely on the premise that Google knows you.Junkfeeds are radicalWe consume junkfeeds in every moment. Shitting. Fucking even. Twitter, Facebook, Google Assist, But YOutube too. Instagram.Junkfeeds are radical. Extreme. They are forcing functions to push us to the edges.We check our feeds when we’re anxious. And junkfeeds make us anxious, radicalized, paranoid, scared, angry.The algorithm does not recommend - it reflects. It’s a machine for turning our own biases against us. Literally programmed it is a recipe for turning depravation into clicks.  “Junkspace pretends to unite, but it actually splinters. It creates communities not of shared interest or free association, but of identical statistics and unavoidable demographics, an oportunistic weave of vested interests. Each man, woman and child is individually targeted, tracked, split off from the rest.. Fragments come together at ‘security’ only, where a grid of video screens disappointingly reassembles individual frames into a banalized, utilitarian cubism that reveals junkspace’s overall coherence to the dispassionate glare of barely trained guards: videoethnography in its brute form.”Two-clicks away from paranoia.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.htmlFacebook is a space for communication. For groups. For friends. Except it actually tears us apart. Junkfeeds feed us neither things we need or want.

Slack has ushered in a post-email feed-based environment. But Slack’s collection of feeds are mostly pre-junked. They’re not yet algorithmic (it’s only a matter of time).But actually the real terror is in feeds of work scrolling through the gig economy. An upworker’s dashboard of jobs is a junkfeed in a different way - controlled by algorithms in a differnet way. The algorithm dictates which upworker appears in which searches.Above/below the API line from VGRFrom Bifo:  From the standpoint of capitalist valorisation, this flow is uninterrupted and finds its unity in the object produced; however, from the standpoint of cognitive workers the supply of labor is fragmented: fractals of time and pulsating cells of labor are switched on and off in the large control room of global production. Therefore the supply of labor time can be disconnected from the physical and juridical person of the worker. Social labor time becomes an ocean of valorising cells that can be summoned and recombined in accordance with the needs of capital.  The organization of labor has been fragmented by the new technology, and workers’ solidarity has been broken at its roots. The labor market has been globalized, but the political organization of the workers has not. The info-sphere has dramatically changed and accelerated, and this is jeopardizing the very possibility of communication, empathy and solidarity.Users to Junkusers?I’m optimistic for the future though - teens, raised not web-native but feed-native, junkfeed-native, are increasingly creating protection for themselves. They do not see identity:user as 1:1 rather many:many. They create throw-away accounts and trash existing accounts with abandon. They have learned to turn themselves into junkusers to shield themselves from the junkfeeds.Users turn themselves into junkusers.

Desperately trying to turn ourselves into Junkusers so that we can retain some agency, autonomy.But autonomy and identity are done. They’re dead. Luxury concepts reserved for the high-minded.After the future of junkfeedsWhere to from here? Will time continue to get subdivided. Junkfeeds become hyper-junkfeeds? On our wrists - in our ears - inside our eyeballs?I wonder if the solution is not slow-tech, and slow-feeds and RSS but in fact the opposite - we have a better chance of resisting by creating hyperfeeds. Sub-second-notifications that create a literal unbroken stream of junk. By twisting these feeds into a post-human form only then might we rediscover what it means to be human. Surrounded by high-frequency-feeds like high-frequency-trading we can let the feeds manage the feeds and perhaps gain some control again.Production of content is still mostly human today - but there is a smell in the air. Change is coming. And junkfeeds, fed by junkcontent will accelerate the problem. Further pushing underground junkusers who seek to protect their identity and personal space in the seas of change.Welcome to a junkfeed world.–Hold your own.Junkfeeds are incoherent by design.

Gambling with our attention and emotional response. We used to “play” the slots by dragging to refresh, but the feeds now infinite and real time no longer require refreshing. Now, we “play” by interacting with the feed. Hearting, thumbsing, commenting, (and not very often) clicking. But every click in the junkfeed spawns more feed. A fractal reward for playing the junkfeed.The subtle soothing reassuring voice of Instagram saying “you’re all caught up” sits in stark contrast to the reality of a 4-dimensional infinity of infinite feeds within the app. The “feed”, stories, activity feed, “search”.

But we need to see these feeds differently — let’s print them, interrupt them, archive, redistribute, and inhabit them with new agendas. With the help of artists, archivists, and activists, let’s de-focus our gaze and look for breaches, breaks, and leaks that resist smooth flow. Let’s teach ourselves new ways to see.

The new development is a ‘culture of real virtuality’, which describes a culture that is organized around electronic media.[3] He says that ‘the space of flows and timeless time are the material foundations of a new culture’,[6] that of the network society. The concept of ‘timeless time’ refers to the collapsing of time in global informational networks, for example automated financial transactions.source: The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture - Wikipedia–https://twitter.com/robhorning/status/1186663941734326272–https://mailchi.mp/cb0071e0a9a5/kneelingbus-852561?e=a68912ab79https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/architectural-intelligencehttps://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/https://www.cnet.com/news/teens-have-figured-out-how-to-mess-with-instagrams-tracking-algorithm/“To be truly countercultural in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.”        @documentjournal https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-the-illusions-of-free-to-play"

    "category": "wiki",
    "content": "In my previous posts I’ve talked about the idea of seeing an organization’s culture. Understanding the culture of interactions, beliefs and so on.This is well and good and gives you a good mental model of an organization to work with. But practically, as soon as you walk in the door the day to day is governed less by culture and more by specific power flows.Understanding who controls the power, who influences who and how decisions get made is critical to understand in the first 30 days of a consulting gig.Every Consultant is an Org Design ConsultantConsulting is not about fixing things or building things - it’s about helping your client fix themselves or build their own thing. But! Sometimes the best way to teach someone to fish is by doing it and letting them watch first.“Org Design” is a fancy way of saying getting things done.##While all of the above references the idea of culture - in truth every individual inside an organization has their own view of the culture. And each individual’s view is often dictated by their relation to power structures. Who are they subservient to? Which individuals have an outsized impact on the culture and which are relatively neutral? Understanding the personal culture of the CEO can be as powerful as understanding the whole organization’s culture.When I start a new client project I start sketching a simple org chart of boxes and lines. It’s the best you can work with on day zero but org charts are too simplistic. As Venkatesh says about org charts:  “A good deal of the process is about imposing anxiety-alleviating platonic structural beauty.”SourceThe org chart of boxes and lines maps reporting structures (kind of) but little else. The org chart only tells us about the topology of the organization, i.e. what are the connections? It tells us nothing of the topography, i.e. the lay of the land. The messy distortions.The real org chart mental model of the organization is much more like this:This from a fascinating analysis by Carta into influence inside their organizationThis network-model showing a small number of highly connected nodes maps well to the lived experience of working inside a messy organization. Knowledge work environments are almost exclusively highly networked and stream-ified places now.But again - these networks and nodes and actors only tell you so much about power. Relational power dynamics are everything and as much as you’re understanding culture inside an organization you need to understand the flows of power.In the early days of a client engagement - watch and listen closely and as soon as someone says or does something that doesn’t make sense. When something that usually or rationally would lead to X but instead leads to Y you’re usually missing a hidden undercurrent of power.Notice turns of phrase, rejected ideas or a statement that turned the room to silence. These mis-steps are power potholes in the consultant’s path. Notice them, write them down, meditate on them and try and ask yourself: what power structures exist here to explain this anomaly?So start on day zero with a crude org chart. In the first week convert your org chart into a network graph and as fast as you can (usually in the first few weeks) augment this network map with the key power players.Reference: https://miro.com/blog/features/graph-visualization-understanding-collaboration/?utm_content=94438573&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-508685581https://twitter.com/artofgig/status/1136316756967002119https://slackhq.com/shared-channels-growth-innovation"

    "content": "This is post 4 in the networked communities blogchain with Brendan Schlagel. To recap briefly:  We want to weave a public web but why don’t we blog more? Brendan explores barriers.  We introduce the idea of “sidewalk spaces” that create communities &amp; blogging as a social act  Brendan explores positive gatekeeping and ways to intentionally keep communities small by limited membersWe’ve talked a lot about spaces. But what kind of spaces are we talking about?In my post building a digital garden I talk about the idea of streams, campfires and gardens as different kinds of digital spaces:  Streams are for information discovery and banter. Think fast feeds like Twitter.  Campfires are gathering spaces, connection forming spaces and places to think. Think plces like blogs.  Gardens are long-term memory palaces, remembering spaces, archiving spaces and knowledge growing places. Think wikis.Of course, no analogy is perfect and the uses of each platform vary wildly and overlap. But broadly speaking the Campfires analogy feels most at threat (perhaps?). The idea of spaces to actually hang out online, not fully public like twitter but faster than blogs?Algorithms vs SidewalksI think this might be one reason why algorithmic feeds betray us - they destroy the notion that we’re in the feed together and instead make us together alone.Instead from the perspective of the platforms (“seeing like a platform”) the “right” behavior is to create private group chat threads (e.g. whatsapp groups). But these are private, not semi-public like sidewalk spaces need to be.Of course this idea isn’t new:so many intense and lively twitter debates should just be held in an ephemeral read-only discord channela lot of real-time nuance, dialogue, and clarification are lost in these monster threads&mdash; quadrillion dollar coach (@ryandawidjan) December 7, 2018There is a large graveyard of websites, apps, startups and ideas that have tried to crack this digital sidewalk / digital campfire space. Perhaps they’re forever doomed to be built, abandoned and reinvented over and over again. Maybe that’s ok.After all - coffee shops and local sidewalk spaces shift and change all the time.Conductor NetworksThere’s a temporal problem here though - streams are “always on” and blogs/wikis are basically completely async.What if there’s a new way - by windowing our attention to time windows to create attention, draw people together and form community. This is the “campfire” section of the analogy but with a deliberate attention to being present at the same time - something blogging really lacks today.This idea is explored in depth by Cody Brown in his post Conductor Social Networks          If you don’t have a Medium account remember they’re always free to read coming in via Twitter               :  There is a human scale feeling to the space that is so completely lost when I sign in to Twitter each morning. It’s like the difference between entering a concert hall and waking up in The Tower of Babel.he goes on…  Alt Shift X uses fairly run of the mill broadcasting software (an app popular with Twitch streamers) but I think he’s tapping into something big that feels like an emerging category on the rise. For lack of a better term, I call this category, “conductor social networks.” A musical conductor’s job is to artfully pull music from an orchestra, and in this case, a conductor does the same but for information, conversation, and/or whatever the conductor desires.Conductor social networks have two core features:      The conductor has a real time ability to drive an audience to whatever space they want them to be in.    Once the audience arrives, the conductor has a baton and a podium. They have an ability to communicate, listen and keep order however they choose.  Press Space to EnterThese conductor networks and communal hang spaces are fascinating to me. While we’re all busily engaged in seemingly real-time feeds there’s very little communal real-time hanging out online anymore.And there’s a graveyard of these “real-time” hang spaces.Anyone remember turntable.fm?Well there’s a new kid on the block:Anyone else enjoying poolparty.fm right now? It’s a funThis idea of concurrency is powerful:  This is what I assume is the driver behind so many people thinking about intentional digital third places. Carving out a pool that they can control more with a sense of discovery that isn’t overbearing… yet can accommodate the flexibility of asynchronosity (that’s the word deal with it) that we simply expect. Waiting for the signal that the water is fine.source: The Concurrency PoolMusic is the glueRemember the campfire analogy? There’s a reason music is a key feature of the campfire chat. To keep people hanging around in real-time you need one of two things. Focused attention or ambient attention. Focused attention is something like a specific conversation or debate, perhaps a performance of some sort. Something that requires you to be there.Ambient attention is something like music - it allows for drops in the conversation and focused attention so that you can stick around comfortably in the same space but without words. Just hanging.I’ve been following this one electronic music radio station since 2009. And there’s a reason this community has been so sticky - despiteHangspaceBut, what if there’s another way to keep a community small - not by limited members but by limiting the time window?Cody recently explored the idea of “pop-up social networks” in his great piece conductor social networks:  There is a human scale feeling to the space that is so completely lost when I sign in to Twitter each morning. It’s like the difference between entering a concert hall and waking up in The Tower of Babel.It’s a mistake to think of a twitter thread as a blog post equivalent.While some twitter threads become immortalized and evergreen mostly the distinction between a twitter thread and a blog post is that it’s real-time in the feed.This is an important distinction.Barriers to EntryThat said - maybe there’s light at the end of the tunnel. As software gets cheaper and “easier” what if we can build our own little sidewalk spaces? Socket.io makes this trivially easy. There’s an example on Glitch that shows how to build a real-time chat room using socket.io.I forked that to make my own chatroom.

We put ourselves online and we boomed as a result.A significant effect of this for me is the idea of digital identity. I’ve been Very Online since my teenage years in a variety of handles, guises and forms and although my handle, username and identity has changed over that time there’s been one constant.Interactions online have been mostly 1:1 between digital identity and real identity. i.e. when you’re interactingBut as I look at my daughter and son (3.5 and 0) it occurs to me that there’s something changing.Where I have invested time in my identity (tomcritchlow.com / @tomcritchlow) the next generation will not understand what this means. They won’t even understand how or why it could have happened.Machine Learning and AI will take our jobs, yes, but it’ll undermine our sense of identity too.

    "content": "Venkatesh just posted a banger:  There is a renaissance underway in online text as a medium. The Four Horsemen of this emerging Textopia are:      Roam, a hypertext publishing platform best understood as a medium for composing conspiracy theories and extended universes.    Substack, a careful and thorough ground-up neoclassical reconstruction of the age-old email newsletter.    Static websites, built out of frameworks like Jekyll or Gatsby (full disclosure: a consulting client).    And finally, Threaded Twitter, a user-pioneered hack-turned-supported feature that has wonderfully revitalized the platform.    I want to take a stab at lightly theorizing this renaissance. And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of blogging. And the future of books. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy hot take on the State of Textual Media. Or at least a simmering take, since I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a year on the backburner.You should read the whole thing - and I don’t disagree with Vgr, the landscape of blogging is shifting and changing.

It’s weird how often this is how it ends  up working. You might talk for hours, but in the end, it’s one casual phrase or thought that ends up unlocking the critical idea. My very first client said as much to me — that after twenty hours of chatting, the value I delivered all came out of one phrase I happened to drop casually in thinking through a problem: “penny auction.” Two seconds in twenty hours.That pattern has repeated for nine years. Hours and hours of conversation and emails, punctuated by scattered moments of high-leverage usable insight — a phrase here, a 2x2 there, a particular quote or metaphor that fits the situation. It used to frustrate me a lot initially. Was there no way to cut out all the hours and just formulaically arrive at just those moments of insight? So far I haven’t found one.

For instance, research suggests that being open minded shapes your mood and makes you more creative. “Open people are more curious, creative, and motivated to explore the world and engage with possibilities,” write the researchers.It’s not hard to imagine why: open-mindedness fosters curiosity, which in turn results in better creative input. It also fosters metacognition, so open-minded people will tend to make more space for self-reflection and interesting questions. Finally, open-minded people may be less driven by fear of failure compared to closed-minded people. The creative process involves learning through trial and error, which includes many failures before arriving at the desired result.Another research study conducted with 340 college students found that open-mindedness may be linked to higher cognitive abilities. We don’t know if being open minded makes you smarter, or being smart makes you open minded, but these two traits seem to go hand-in-hand.@ness_labs https://nesslabs.com/closed-mind-to-open-mind"

    "content": "In this post I want to break down what I mean by “strategic independent” and why, whatever path you’re on and expertise you have, you can bring more value for yourself and your clients by thinking strategically.We’ll walk through:  What strategic work is - by looking at a variety of contexts you might work within and how to spot them.  Why strategic work is better - both for you and the client, offering more value to them and being more interesting for you.  How strategic work enables you to charge more - and keep clients retained for longer, a compounding effect on your ability to charge more.  How you can begin to think strategically - offering some real examples from my own career.Finally, how being independent offers more value for your clients by enabling you to gain adjacent context that your client might not be able to see and that we get this adjacent from our network - and therefore we should really think of being codependent with our network.Onwards…Strategic work is work-in-contextClient work can be frustrating:Ever had a project cancelled without notice?Ever had to go through endless revisions and feel like you’re not getting it?Ever had a project stall before it even started because you can’t agree on the exact deliverables?Ever had a piece of work never get implemented by a client?But frustration is a two player game - when you’re frustrated that work doesn’t make sense - the client is likely frustrated that your work doesn’t meet their objectives well enough.Context is the key.Even before I start working with a client in the very first meeting I always make sure I ask questions about business model, team structure, company priorities and more. These don’t always feel relevant to the specific request but help me better map out both the work I need to do and the stakeholders that need to see it.The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context          I wrote a whole post called ways of seeing that explores ideas around sensemaking inside an organization               .The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context1.Overlapping contextsSo when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts          This model seems… obvious? Except I’m always surprised at how often consultants and agencies fail to properly explore the wider contexts of the business either before starting work or during their engagement.               :However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:Every project exists in multiple overlapping contexts - here’s some of the types of context to look for:  People (who are the stakeholders? what do they care about?)  Resources (what can they realistically do with your work?)  Brand (what is the position of the company?)  Marketing (audiences, channels, analytics)  Business model (revenue, profit)  Product (how does their product work, what is possible?)  The user (who is the user? What do they care about?)Your work likely overlaps at least partly with all of these ideas - but also depending on your specific work you might have different contexts and add more nuance.Strategic work is better workOnce you understand the concentric circles within which your work happens you’ll be able do work that’s more effective and useful for your clients.Two examples from my own work:Scenario #1I was working as a marketing advisor for a client and early in the engagement (partly because we were discussing me becoming the full-time CMO) I was invited to sit in on their quarterly board meeting. This experience was formative in better understanding the drivers and motivations of the business - by understanding who literally owned the business better. This context was crucial for proposing work and for ensuring that pitching that work to the board was smooth. The CEO gave me some of the necessary context but by attending that board meeting I got a vantage point that I didn’t realize existed previously.Scenario #2Last year I was working with a client to integrate an acquisition into the main business - in particular to ensure that one business function was working correctly. My north star and most of the language in the team was about revenue projections for the function. Makes sense. But, I discovered that actually the SVP’s OKR for the quarter was ensuring that the business unit was functioning smoothly. While revenue was obviously a thing that they cared about, the more important context was around process and communication around that process. Once I had this context everything became easier since I could be more closely aligned with the objectives of the business.Catastrophic Events &amp; Context CollapseThere’s a certain kind of experience that I want to describe where everything goes to shit. Certain events in business collapse the environment. For example - let’s take that context model for app design from earlier in the post. But let’s assume that the growth objectives are “in crisis” - this could be missing targets, people change, overspend, change in marketing strategy etcThese catastrophic events collapse the environment and cascade downwards. Every circle inside gets ignored, paused, cancelled, changed, redefined. These events are felt like system-shock for anyone operating in these lower circles          Not available for graphic design work.               .But for those above the fire-line there are two things that are crucial:  Their objectives and priorities haven’t changed much, they’re still operating within the same context they were previously (although they may feel some turbulence)  They likely knew about the catastrophic event ahead of time. They may even have been responsible for causing the catastrophic event.We’ve likely all been personally inside a context as it collapses - either as a full time employee or a consultant / agency partner. It’s not fun.Riding these crashes is a skill that I think in theory you can get good at - learning how to sprint at a moments notice in a new direction and operate supernaturally fast in a crashing environment.But I think it’s way easier to instead always be searching upwards for more context awareness - i.e. working strategically. This helps you ride out those catastrophic events with more planning, awareness and foresight.Strategic work is better paidIn addition to being better work (for clients and for you) - strategic work is also better paid.As an independent - you’ll hear a lot of advice boil down to “charge more”. I’ve even said it myself! And it’s true - it’s the best advice you can get. Except… it’s kind of empty advice. I don’t think it provides much direction for how exactly you go about doing it.Translating executional work into strategic work is a framework that I think gives concrete ways of continually ratcheting up the price &amp; value of your work.The key idea is that at every layer of context there are new kinds of work - and by reaching for associated layers of context you can get involved in new kinds of work that are associated with and grounded in the thing you know but also a slight stretch.Not only can you charge more because the work is more useful, impactful and better but you can also charge for the associated parts of uncovering context - workshops, user research, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews etc.Let’s look at two examples:Scenario #1 - From Writing to Strategic WritingLet’s imagine you’re a writer - commissioned to write for a client’s branded content site. Let’s say you get paid $200 per article. The work: writing. How might we think of writing-in-context? Here’s a list of context that you should ask for and where it’s not available or it’s done poorly offer to step in:  Creating a style guide for all the writers  User research for end users to uncover what they want to read (e.g. by creating personas)  Competitive analysis for other branded content sites, who writes for them and how they operate  A content marketing plan for the branded content site  A content marketing plan across the whole brand  Themed content franchises that can scale beyond individual posts  SEO research into keywords they care about targetingScenario #2 - From UX Research to Strategic ResearchLet’s imagine you’re a UX researcher - creating user research from real users for clients. The work: creating user research projects, finding relevant users and running them. This is likely reasonably well-paid work as-is but let’s look at ways we might take this UX-research and place it in-context:  Creating a set of product principles based off user research  Reviewing a product roadmap  Running a design sprint internally to ideate new product ideas (grounded in user research experience of course)  Proposing a broader marketing focus group studySome more examples of how work and associated context work might fit together:  Work: email copywriter -&gt; context: brand voice document  Work: paid marketing -&gt; context: paid marketing dashboard creation  Work: marketing strategy -&gt; context: hiring a marketing teamI’ve got a very loose working theory that every time you expand your context-circles you get paid an order of magnitude more money.It’s not unreasonable to imagine:  Writing: $200 / article  Style guide: $2,000  Content strategy: $20,000These are necessarily imperfect analogies and will vary wildly from industry to industry          I’m keen to hear more stories of different kinds of work where people have navigated this shift into wider contexts - email me!               , but here’s a specific callout as you start to bundle “the work” and “the context”:Don’t give the context work away for free. In fact, do the opposite - charge more for it than your regular work.I see this often with more junior or less confident independents - you’re trying to close “the work” and so you throw in “the context” for free or as a sweetener.Don’t do this! Work-in-context is typically more expensive than regular work so don’t be afraid to price it separately and confidently. Don’t worry if the client doesn’t bite at first - strategic work is only valuable at certain inflection points (see below graphs) but they’ll remember that you offered it and it’ll come back around.Strategy and Stewardship - a framework for retaining clients for a long timeSo we’ve established that you can get paid more money for strategic work - and now I want to show you that the new higher rates you’re charging can also last longer. A compounding effect on your pricing power.I learned about the model of Strategy &amp; Stewardship from the Helsinki Design Lab:  It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop          Page 40 of Recipes for Systemic Change by Helsinki Design Lab        Their solution? Strategy and stewardship:  We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural steward          Page 15 of Legible Practices by Helsinki Design Lab        This idea of a feedback loop between strategy and implementation is one I’ve taken to heart. It maps directly to my mental model of a typical long-term retained client relationship.Imagine a 12-month client retainer with the strategic work in green and the implementation in blue:You can see that (roughly) the total amount of work is constant but there is a phase shift from strategy at the beginning to mostly execution &amp; implementation (stewardship) and then a hard shift back into strategic work.If you look at strategy on its own:There are two key things to draw from this chart:The long-term work begins with strategic work, so if you want to get involved in a project early (a common request) you have to be thinking and working strategically.But importantly, if you only do strategy work the client isn’t going to keep you around for months 3-12.  No matter how lucrative that strategy work is, if you’re not shifting your outputs to implementation/stewardship then there isn’t enough work for either you or the client to justify sticking around and so you end up with a short sprint of a project.Now, if you look at execution on it’s own:There are two key drawbacks to only doing implementation/execution work:Firstly - notice how the blue line shoots up a few months into the project? When you’re only working on the execution/implementation you get called into the project too late - the strategy is already set.Secondly - notice how at some point in the future, the client either pauses, reviews or changes their strategy and the project unexpectedly ends? This can seem like it “comes out of nowhere” if you’re only doing the execution work and not aware of the wider context.So what does stewardship work look like?So what is stewardship exactly? Sometimes it’s literally just rolling up your sleeves to do the work outlined in the strategy. Never underestimate how powerful a single reference piece of work can be - e.g. you want the editorial team to produce 1000s of pieces of content over the next 12 months - but if you create the gold standard piece of content it can get referenced again and again and become the inspiration for a whole team.So is the execution just plugging away in the trenches? Yes sometimes, but I think the most powerful stewardship work is around momentum - helping the organization or project accelerate their output. Some examples from my own work for things that look like stewardship:  Hiring &amp; building teams  Building workstreams, processes  Building dashboards and reporting templates  Adding partnerships and relationshipsIf you take this strategy &amp; stewardship approach - when the client comes to review the strategy at month 6 you’re still there working with the client and able to offer tangible and concrete insights into the work. How is the strategy evolving? Where should we adjust? What have we achieved?Using this approach the average retainer length for clients I work with is 20 months.I recall an important breakthrough for my own thinking - a client had hired another consultant to work on a project and afterwards I asked my client how the experience was and he said:  “It was fine - but he just gave advice. I like working with you because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves and do the work when it needs doing”This was a real lightbulb moment for me - up until that time I’d always worried about doing “menial” or “low-paid” work as a consultant but charging a strategy-based day-rate.But the thing I realized was that if you can provide momentum to an organization it doesn’t matter if you’re writing title tags in an SEO environment or putting together a board pitch you should do the most valuable thing the business needs at that moment.The freedom of a consultant is that you can ignore job title / role / responsibility and be laser focused on moving the business towards key objectives and mixing your outputs from small to big as needed.So, don’t undervalue either part of your work - either the strategy or the stewardship. Remember that graph up above with the blue/green strategy/execution mix? I bill it all at the same day rate. Stewardship is just as valuable as strategy and there’s no reason to somehow charge less for the execution work.Only let clients in the strategy doorSo we’ve established that the combination of strategy &amp; stewardship is important - but there’s a crucial note to make:Clients that come to you only for implementation are going to be your worst clients.Wait what? Haven’t I been telling you to get your hands dirty? Yes, but…In his book the business of expertise in chapter 10 titled “Distinguishing expertise from implementation” David Baker uses the great analogy of a building with two connected rooms and two entrances, one for strategy and one for execution.The whole chapter is a delight and the punchline is: “only let clients in the strategy door”:The argument really boils down to:  Implementation work is hard work to sell - you get poor quality clients expecting a more easily commoditized output that drives your business towards lower margins  Not only that but implementation work is often more stressful and deadline-driven  So of course do both for clients but only let them in through the strategy door to ensure that you do better, higher value and higher margin work.You should really buy the book - it’s a fast read but has lots of pieces of wisdom          There is however a shorter (older) version of this argument from David online here               .Importantly - if you accept that you can do a lot of implementation work for clients but they should all start with strategy then your external positioning should be entirely focused around the strategy work to attract the right kinds of clients.Time &amp; MoneyHere’s a funny thing - when you read the accepted literature about pricing as an independent you’ll hear again and again that pricing based on time is a bad thing          To be fair - many of the freelancer advice posts do caveat their advice saying day-rates are ok, but it’s ually a footnote and I think it’s easy to come away as a beginner only understanding that charging for time is bad. I know I did.               . And, maybe they’re right - but I’ve had plenty of success charging on a loosely-coupled time-based approach (almost all of my work is scoped at a day rate, at least to begin with).I have a theory that this time-based approach to pricing is especially powerful as you move through a context-transition.Why? Well - as you go through this cycle of exposure to new contexts and working in new contexts you are by definition operating in new types of work and new types of environments and it’s hard to control the inputs and outputs.Put simply - as you ladder up into wider contexts for your work you don’t yet have enough experience to properly scope and price the work - not to mention you may be continually expanding your context not upwards but sideways into new types of workstreams.So I say - if you’re reading the commonly accepted wisdom about pricing and feeling like you’re doing it wrong by pricing based on time let me tell you that you’re totally fine and that strategic work by definition can be fuzzy and so scoping on project work can be dangerous.My own journey out of SEOLooking back at my career - this idea of doing work-in-context has determined the path I’ve taken from SEO manager to digital strategy to consulting work.The problem with SEO is that it’s inherently non-strategic. As an activity it’s increasingly commoditized and marginalized. Not that SEO-traffic is not important or that SEO is going away, but that the strategic activities you undertake to achieve business-level goals are usually not owned by SEO practitioners or agencies          Yes, there are exceptions to this of course but there’s a reason there’s no widely recognized c-suite SEO function.               .This wasn’t always true - there was a golden age of ~2008-2012 where an SEO agency could get directly in front of the CMO to work on digital strategy. Back in 2011 when I worked at Distilled it wasn’t uncommon to be working directly on digital strategy for fortune-500 brands, in a context model that looked something like this:But I could see the writing on the wall and could feel the shift as everyone else in digital “caught up” to the competencies and experience that the SEO industry had built up over the previous decade to the point where a more traditional SEO engagement now looks like this:As I felt this shift towards SEO being less strategic I needed to find ways to expand my context and work in different types of work more directly and explicitly.When I first started consulting in 2014, yes I worked mostly on SEO projects. But I was keenly aware of the wider context and pushed myself to ask questions and be curious - whether about the business model or the teams executing the work.Over time - by asking questions and pushing for more context I was able to start to get involved in several different wider context-circles and evolve the work I do          One consequence of this of course has been a difficulty in describing the work I do. For more thoughts on describing and defining my work see my post on media design.               .How to learn to be more strategicTaking my personal SEO example above it’s hard to overstate the importance and value of being curious. Being curious about the industry you’re in and how it works, being curious about the clients you’re working for and being curious about the context of your own work is where this whole strategic independent path starts.Then, from there the path to strategic work looks something like this:  Ask questions and be curious (about the business, the industry, the people)  Explicitly ask to see surrounding context (e.g. as a writer, ask for the content strategy, as a marketer ask for the strategic roadmap)  Then, next time explicitly ask to be included in the creation of the surrounding context  Then, start offering and leading the projects to add the surrounding context  Repeat as you expand your contextHere’s a worked example from my own experience on “how to be more strategic” as I learned about brand positioning work for clients:  The first step was being curious about brand positioning - how does it work? What does it look like? I got exposed to a handful of these kinds of projects at Google and always asked questions  The second step is to keep your ear close to the ground and ask to be involved in a brand positioning workshop or project as it’s happening - just as an observer / participant.  The third step is to spot opportunities for where a brand positioning project would make sense and add value and source a partner to help with the work for a client - where I’m leading and owning the work output but working with a partner.  The fourth step is creating and running a brand positioning project on my own for a client (probably smaller to begin with while I gain confidence).This explicit evolution and experience in my own work probably took 3-4 years with the help of some friends but is exactly that ladder of context-awareness that enables you to get involved in strategic work.As you can see, this path to strategic work relies on gaining context from client work - but there’s another way to gain context - from your network.The adjacent-context benefit of independenceMost of this post focuses on the idea of context as gathered from your client and their business - but there’s another great source of context: peers.Co-dependence is really the right word for independence          Frank was kind enough to point out that in-fact co-dependence is not the right word at all! The actual definition of the word is around enabling addiction. I didn’t know that! The correct word is interdependence and Frank Chimero has a more recent post all about this topic: back to the cave. Thanks Frank!               . I’ve talked a lot about the power of the network - both as a tool for gathering leads for your business but also as an emotional support network.Frank Chimero wrote a wonderful essay I think about often titled the inferno of independence which is hard to boil down but looks at the nature of independent work - and articulates this shift from independence to co-dependence:  Listen: we only deserve what we can maintain and keep safe. A community is only as good as how well it takes care of all its members. There is no independence. There is only subservience or co-dependence. And I choose you. I choose community.Co-dependence and network building has plenty of other benefits          I wrote about using a network to build a steady stream of high value leads in my post strange attraction.                but one key benefit of a diverse network is the adjacent-context. Some of the most helpful context you bring to your clients as an independent is the context they would otherwise not have access to or overlook.Adjacent context is thinking laterally about an industry, organization or problem - looking sideways for unusual or unexpected analogies or insights into expanding contexts that might not be obvious to you or your clients. You can only get this from hanging around a blend of interesting people who are also context-aware.So then, the strategic independent is someone who not only helps bridge context inside an organization but outside as well. This distance from a client’s organization is extremely valuable - and yet another reason not to undersell the value of context before and during an engagement. Someone able to connect the dots and do work-in-context but also expand the context into new directions.Will you join me on the path to being a strategic independent?Hopefully this long post was helpful - let’s recap the main points:  Work-in-context is more rewarding &amp; more effective for you and the client  It also allows you to charge for additional types of work! Hence making you better paid  But it also allows you to work with clients over a long time-horizon, extending the length of your client contracts (a compounding effect on revenue when combined with charging more)  As you begin to shift to strategic work - start to only let clients “in the strategy door” - you’ll get better clients this way  Learning how to be strategic is relatively straight forward (even if it takes a while) by constantly looking for additional context  And, as you work in fluid context-shifting client work don’t be afraid to charge based on time - despite what the received wisdom advises.  Finally as an independent remember that co-dependence with your network is actually the ideal state and you can gain context from peers just as much as you can from clientsI’m writing a book. Originally it was designed for “independent consultants” and… that’s still an audience. But I realized writing this post that the audience is wider - I’m writing not just for those doing “consulting” or even “strategy work” but also designers, writers, researchers, leaders who are doing strategic work, independently - the strategic independent.To peek the outline for the book head over here, and you can subscribe to my newsletter here to keep updated with the latest.I’d love to hear your experience with strategic work, independence and context.

Bravo Aaron.One little epiphany I had reading this was around the instability of truth.Thanks to the “perfect memory” of digital media, internet subcultures are able to create their own visions of past, present, and future. The internet has freed them from the top-down schedules and narratives of mass media. With nearly all of recorded history at their fingertips, they can cherry-pick interesting scraps of information from the archives and construct new grand narratives with unprecedented ease.@aaronzlewis https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memesFor me - this ability for subcultures to create their own visions of past, present and future is very clear in alt-right and QAnon style communities where truth doesn’t matter. By sidestepping truth as a principle they are able to create much more stable and enduring frameworks for reality.The conversations of internet subcultures often feel substantive and expansive compared to the shallow discourse of presidential debates, op-ed pages, and cable TV shows. Mainstream news cycles rarely last more than a few hours, and their narratives are constantly shifting. They don’t tend to give a big-picture sense of where we came from or where we’re going. Internet subcultures, by contrast, are building grand narratives and meme worlds that help people feel their way through the chaos that’s currently unfolding.@aaronzlewis https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memesThe NYTimes, by adhering to truth, and chasing the speed of events as they unfold, is unable to build grand narratives.That’s perhaps partly why QAnon is so alluring - it offers a stable grand narrative to believe in:QAnon carries on a tradition of apocalyptic thinking that has spanned thousands of years. It offers a polemic to empower those who feel adrift.Adrienne LaFrance https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/"

In particular this part:This is what I’m calling the age of the Renaissance Creator — the hybridization of the individual as both a creator and an entrepreneur. This development and definition of ‘creativity’ is one of the more interesting things happening today because it is contrary to the supposed logic for a creator to go independent. We like to say independence (see: passion economy) is valuable because it lets a creator focus on what they do best; create. But actually it’s the opposite. By going independent, the creator is aspiring to not only create, but willingly assume the management and business of their entire self. This acceptance of responsibility as a formula for success will dictate a creator’s desire to go independent and develop a micro-label or decide to limit duties and create within a larger media organization.I want to be a creator.

Not about content - I’m still bullish on that. But rather I’m increasinghly wary of the “editor in chief” title when embedded inside brands.From my vantage point working across traditional media companies (The NYT, Mashable etc) and my work with brands producing content at scale (Gartner, Wirecutter etc)There are some key mistakes that get made:  The “brand as publisher” model is often pitched by creative agencies - and as a result the focus is placed on creative production. This drives the cost/content piece too high. This unsustainable price produces “good” content but leads to the brand not creating enough content to reach scale.  Through hiring an overly “editorial” folks they underinvest or neglect audience development - distribution is often heavily weighted to paid channels and they neglect the longer arc of compound organic growth through building organic distribution channels (e.g. SEO)  SEO practiioners meanwhile are often not actually very good at editorial work  Brands lack the connective tissue to conversion (e.g. email signups)So - I’m re-evaulating my positon on the “editor in chief” role. Instead I see an emerging role that I’m going to call “content ops”1Content Ops is a new embracing of the hybrid role that editorial people inside organizations need to play.Editor in chief has the luxury of publishing mechanics being “built into” the organization. But within a brand it’s not a given and many things need building or investing in deliberately. Namely:Conversion and commercialsTechnologyDistributionWorked Example: RobinHoodAPp basedEditor in chief for stock news? sure but….The role of “editor in chief” is a positive one and sounds like the right answer because it implies the thing that people care about - strong point of view, meaningful, interesting content. But when you look at the organizational dynamics of the brand what’s more often required is a pragmatic leader capable of a hybrid role            I’ve previously called this the practice of “media design” &#8617;      "

If they ever make a film like Jiro Dreams of Sushi but about workshops then my friend is going to play the star role.Their ability to design, orchestrate and execute an effective workshop with a big company where multiple stakeholders are involved is just incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it.The first time I participated in one of their workshops my jaw hit the floor.We’ve had plenty of conversations over the years about helping his agency “do thought leadership” or “start content marketing” or “blogging”. Each time I stress the importance of demonstrating their expertise - their product is so differentiated it’s not even funny!They’ve been blogging and such for a while now and… it’s not bad, but it’s kind of generic. They write articles like “Avoid these three pitfalls with email marketing” or “Black friday holiday tips for ecommerce sites”. The content is fine - and keeps them moving forwards - it shows up on their site, in their emails. There’s good tips!But it’s not thought leadership.I can see that there’s an extreme level of expertise and operational excellence at my friend’s agency, but it’s not well articulated in their marketing and content.This story is, unfortunately, very common. Agencies and consultants who are great at what they do but produce “content marketing” and “thought leadership” that is generic, bland and not very effective.Why is that?Enter Tacit KnowledgeThe answer to this puzzle lies in understanding tacit knowledge. This from Cedric Chin’s just outstanding series on tacit knowledge:Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone.Think about riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle is impossible to teach through descriptions. Sure, you can try to explain what it is you’re doing when you’re cycling, but this isn’t going to be of much help when you’re teaching a kid and they fall into the drain while you’re telling them to “BALANCE! JUST IMAGINE YOU ARE ON A TIGHTROPE AND BALANCE!”.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/The crucial part about tacit knowledge is that it’s extremely hard to teach and pass on to others:How do you teach tacit knowledge? How do you teach bike riding, for that matter?When I was a kid, I taught myself how to ride a bike … by accident. And then I taught my sisters and then my cousin and then another kid in the neighbourhood who was interested but a little scared. They were zooming around in about an hour each. The steps were as follows:Pick a small bike, much smaller than the body of your learner, and therefore not far off the ground. This is useful for the learner because they will be able to put their feet down and save themselves at any moment. It’s also less scary to be not far off the ground.Have them push with their legs and go forward a short distance, again with their feet only inches off the ground. Do this repeatedly, by pushing off, putting both feet down, then stopping and repeating.Make the pushes harder and the distances longer. Eventually, they will spend tens of seconds gliding with their feet held up. The goal here is have them learn how it feels like to balance on a bike.On one of those glides, once they feel ready (and likely a little bored — the point is to get them to do step 3 so many times that they’re feeling secure and eager to move on) — well, once you reach that point, tell them to start peddling.Voilà. You have a bicycling kid.Notice how little verbal instruction is involved. What is more important is emulation, and action — that is, a focus on the embodied feelings necessary to ride a bicycle successfully. And this exercise was quite magical for me, for within the span of an hour I could watch a kid go from conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.In other words, tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/One of the most fascinating things about tacit knowledge is not only that it’s hard to teach - but once you have tacit knowledge you might not even understand how it works…Again, quoting Cedric’s posts (you really should read the whole series) - he talks about this situation where expert tennis players are able to detect the type of serve within a 100 millisecond window:Now we cut to black before the racket hits the ball. And the experts are still able to say what type of serve that is — they haven’t even seen the racket hit the ball, and they can tell you 85% of the time whether it’s a kick, a flat, or a slice serve. And they can even predict backhand or forehand side on the return. And at that point the novices performance pretty much drops off. Now if we cut it back a little bit further, they’re both down to random (prediction).So now we’ve defined our window of expert advantage. From 50 milliseconds before contact, to 50 milliseconds after contact. There’s a 100 millisecond window in there when the experts have a distinct advantage over the non-experts. So that’s the research finding.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/creating-training-programs/But! The plot thickens - the experts can identify the serve but they can’t explain why:The experts can’t necessarily see what they’re seeing — they almost put it in the ‘ESP category’. [...] And if you press them enough, they’ll start making stuff up. The way that experts do, because they want to give you an answer. So you really need to start ascertaining where that is.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/creating-training-programs/What a phrase - the experts can’t see what they’re seeing.Let’s come back to my friend the master workshopper - the Serena Williams of workshops. In conversations I grew frustrated - “If you could write your 10-part guide to running workshops it would be an incredibly useful piece of content that would get referenced everywhere and by everyone”.But with our understanding of tacit knowledge…. maybe my friend can’t see what he’s seeing? It’s not a failure of effort - he finds it almost impossible to produce this series on running workshops.In reality you struggle with questions like:  What’s the right level of abstraction?  How do I explain the ideas clearly?  Which bits should I include and in what order?And the effort to produce the ultimate guide to workshops stalls and loses momentum.Is all hope lost?Enter ACTA - Applied Cognitive Task AnalysisThe good news is that there’s research and methods on how to extract tacit knowledge from experts. Sneaky eh? The simplest approach is ACTA. From Cedric once again:A Quick Recap of ACTAACTA is a protocol of three interview methods and a presentation format, designed to help a practitioner extract information about the cognitive demands and skills required for a task. The three interview methods are:You first create a task diagram. This is a broad overview of the task in question, and identifies the difficult cognitive elements.You do a knowledge audit — which identifies all the ways in which expertise is used in a domain. You also extract examples based on actual experience.You do a simulation interview — you give the expert a simulation of a single incident, and then probe the expert’s cognitive processes over the course of that simulation.Finally, you present the extracted information in a cognitive demands table.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/john-cutlers-product-expertise/In that post Cedric actually walks through an applied version of ACTA to extract John Cutler’s product expertise. And I think it’s compelling - I think it’s the same process that my friend should go through to build an outline for the “ultimate workshop guide”.It’s not going to solve all of the problems - and it’s not trivial to do - but it provides a framework and process to follow that gets to a reasonable outline of where the expertise lies. In short, how to produce content that focuses on the expert insights and not the generic “how to” advice.How do you start? Small b blogging!This all seems quite cumbersome and heavy handed - going through an ACTA knowledge extraction process sounds like hard work, and doing it from a cold start might not be very effective. Instead if you find yourself trying to get better at thought leadership or content marketing I’d encourage you to go through a process that looks something like this:  Step 1: You first need to start creating content (writing, podcasting, slide decks etc) that allows you to expose your thinking. Thick data - rich in context. Don’t focus on tightly polished and absolute statements and “how-to” but focus on questions, context and musings. What you want is less “5 ways to run a remote workshop” and more “Unanswered questions and thoughts about zoom workshops”. Some inspiration:          small b blogging      a pre-history of weeknotes      lead with some thinking        Step 2: Small group feedback! Once you’re producing this kind of rich context content you should be getting input and feedback from a small group of peers / respected contacts / prospective clients etc. The key idea here is that you don’t need distribution, you just need to listen! Simply email 5-10 people and ask them what they think - have conversations with people about the ideas. This will begin to expose the shape of your tacit knowledge - the things you’re writing about and the way you’re framing your thinking will naturally start to expose where the real insights and expertise lies. This will build confidence that you “have something to say” and might even begin to point out some areas of tacit expertise.  Step 3: Commit to deliberate conversations on the topics you’re writing about. This can be with peers, friends, co-workers etc. Personally I find that podcasts have been great at helping me articulate and talk around subjects - repeatedly touching on key ideas helps you find clear ways of talking about them but also helps you realize which bits are “aha!” moments for your audience.  Step 4: Run an ACTA workshop! Find someone who knows a bit about your field - ideally a peer - and have them run through an ACTA workshop with you - formally extracting, shaping and articulating the tacit knowledge.I think this process would be very effective - both in building a public presence and in building confidence. You can see how if you follow this process you will begin to build an audience (albeit very small!) and you’ll get more confident and articulate at writing and thinking in public - and eventually you’ll reach the output from the ACTA workshops that will give you a clear outline for producing world class content - world class thought leadership that matches your world class expertise."

Firstly running through this whole process takes a long time (and the average CMO tenure is only 18 months! how much of this can you execute in 18 months?!).

There’s this kinAn ethnography of senior leaders might uncover a specific gap between “accepted wisdom” and “how things really work”.That is, thatYou look around and:  the mission &amp; vision is only half-formed (it was the output of the strategic leadership offsite but still isn’t locked yet)  your data is not complete, you can only see some of what you want and don’t fully trust the other half.

How do you turn your intuition into something more concrete, credible and clear?Some ideas:1. Don’t focus on mission/vision/strategy - focus on the diagnosis.Good strategy starts with diagnosis and guiding principle.2. Shift from targets to input/output metricsYou’ll be handed goals.

But what if we forgot about strategy and just did 100 reps?Maybe before you come to me for a content strategy, you should make 100 pieces of content. Yeah, sure maybe I’d be out of work - but I think a lot of startups in particular would be better off shipping content instead of doing content strategy.–Maybe the artist’s way is the right model here. A deliberate system based around output layering skills up as you go.Let’s make this concrete - what would an engagement look like for a B2B SAAS company?Week 0: Lightweight strategy, to do some quick market sizing, competitive analysisWeek 1: Publish some words. Doesn’t matter much what you publish, but get comfotable with a weekly cadenceWeek 2: Distribute something. Publishing something that goes into an email, social channels etc.Week 3: Publish something longer / differnet / more interestingWeek 4:–Conversely, those clients that come to me and say: “We’ve made 100s of pieces of content, we’ve figured out a lot of what works and what doesn’t. Both from our audience and from our internal workflow. But here are three real challenges we’re facing.” Are much better clients. We have real data, real insights, and we know a bit about our customers and ourselves.So next time you ask for a content strategy - maybe just start writing."

Every such system has only a handful of bottlenecks/constraints that prevent the entire system from reaching the global optimum.  Any efforts to optimize the non-constraints are wasted because the throughput of the entire system is controlled by the constraints (aka weakest links). So if you try to optimize your sales but the problem is not enough demand, you’re wasting your time and money.Is the point of innovation to reveal constraints?Can this pair with strategic design?Growth often requires a delicate tradeoff of value. e.g. two sided marketplace"

Places that follow rules. But every library I’ve been in always seems more like a wilderness than you might imagine. A library is a hyperobject - it’s ordered but it’s form can’t fit in your field of view in one go and so you are left to grab hold of ghosts, imagined shadows, to chase down half-remembered ideas and stumble upon secret connections.Anyway. In the year 2025 everyone has a personal library, their own hyperobject in their pocket walking around with them.I have done a dismal job of blogging recently and so I’m building a kind of personal library. Bram Adams has some lovely writing and thinking about the practice of Personal Library Science:Personal Library Science is defined as: the discipline concerned with the organization, retrieval, and transformation of an individual's data.The operative words here are: organization, transformation, and individual. Personal library science is focused on you and your data, not the existence of all data itself. More succinctly, personal library science is focused on your relationship with your information. How do we store information so that it useful at a later date? How do we transform our information into new valuable assets in different creative domains? How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of eight billion distinct individuals? How do we chronicle the information diet of a single person as they learn new things, interact with the world at different phases in their life? How do we make sure we can pass down our best knowledge to generations below? In sum, how do we manage the libraries of us?@_bramses https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-54/After all as Bram says later in Priority list for 2025:  I’m of the strong opinion that personal websites are going to become really important in the continued increase of real world culture from the internet, as well as being able to exist in a language model world. And they’re just really fun.Amen to that.A Library of LinksMy library is rudimentary right now. It’s really two things:  A new linkblog designed for easy sharing of URLs into an archive. I’m heavily using Quotebacks as the foundation of grab a link, grab a quote and publish to my site.  An automatic archive of every single external link on the site. Right now I’m at 1586.https://helloruby.substack.com/p/no-95-small-archives-without-blurs?utm_source=post-banner&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=posts-open-in-app&amp;triedRedirect=true"

Rich Search Interfaces Will EmergeGoogle is a complex interface hidden under simplicity. What we consider “ten blue links” has been anything but for a long time. Producs, maps, videos, knowledge panels, peoeple also askWe’re already starting to see the basics being re-built. Stuff like maps and product listings.But what about interactice UI elements?

It’s the wild west and anyone who knows what’s coming is lying.  My personal take is that we’re moving from ranking to recommendations. Every link that survives will need a reason to exist.2. Product Expectations  Consumers now expect every search box to be as smart as chatGPT  3. Operations  Your engineers have to learn whole new workflows to work alongside AI agents4. Access to Capital  Access to capital is harder, funding is reserved for “AI companies” now…✨🤖✨What does this all feel like in business? It feel anxious. Like the calm before the storm. While the AI disruption dominates the news cycles it’s not really showing up in the data yet… To paraphrase a headline, disruption is everywhere except the dataI’m reminded of the visualization of anxiety in Inside Out 2 when they have a panic attack:The kinds of tensions this environment creates:  Teams being asked to re-prioritize based on abstract looming threats that don’t yet show up in their data  Companies feeling like they should be doing more with less, while also needing to do lots of new things for the first time  Individuals entirely unsure when it’s ok to use AI silently, or when to disclose “AI helped me with this”.

    "content": "What apartment number do I live in?Its an innocent enough question that I would have been able to answer 1.57 seconds ago. Now - my heart is racing and my mind is working faster and slower than it has ever done and I’m trying to figure out if it’s apartment 2A or 2C that I live in.You see - 1.57 seconds ago my access to the net went dark. Offline. Out. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Since birth I’ve had access to the net subcutaneously - implants under the skin just under my scalp able to communicate directly with my brain. Two arrays of gigahertz processors with microtech Bluetooth.At least that’s what I’d have told you 1.57 seconds ago. Now I’m barely keeping my shit together trying to figure out if I can remember which apartment I live in.–I round the corner of Kayes Street and I’ve taken to muttering to myself - the silence in my own brain is a thunderous cacophony and unbearable. Muttering under my breath helps a little. Distracted by my own mumbling, my legs don’t have to question which apartment I live in - they guide me to 2A comfortably and my hands go into auto-pilot, placing the keys in the lock and opening the door. I’m glad at least part of my body has it’s shit together because my brain is an unreliable useless mess right now.–It’s two hours later and I’ve dug up an old iphone - back before the microtech networks were two-way and instantaneous like how we used to use iphones to communicate. Now it seems laughably archaic but holding this slim piece of metal and glass in my hand I’m able to marvel at how slick a device this is and right now it’s a life saver. I rummage for a plug and put it on to charge. While it’s charging I look around my apartment and it’s like my brain is swimming through molasses. All of my memories, thoughts, ideas are like they’re half a second too slow. With access to the net everything happens instantly (or so it feels) - but now it’s like there are little men inside my head who have to go and retrieve files stored in cabinets and some cabinets are further away than others.–I’m back online. The glowing screen of the iphone gazes unflinchingly at me. I’d forgotten what this was like. I fire up blinkchat and am overwhelmed by the constant stream of updates and chatter - everyone is asking where I am, what happened to me and if I’m ok. As soon as I read an update, 6 more pop up on the screen. My stupid regular brain just can’t keep up - everyone else is sending these messages directly from their brains via microtech and all I have are these wet stumps of flesh called hands with which to type (type!) a reply out on.  Am ok. Net went offline. Am home. All ok.This doesn’t seem to appease the beast and my iphone crashes as continuous updates and notifications overwhelm the poor device. Jeez - is that what used to happen inside my brain? No wonder life feels so slow all of a sudden.–I write my apartment number on my hand, just in case, and head out for lunch. My favorite vietnamese place is just around the corner. I walk into the cafe and head up to the counter - somewhere in the back of my brain I’m marveling at the number of things that are happening simultaneously in my body, walking, thinking, looking. See, this old lump of flesh and bones isn’t so useless after all! I’m starting to kind of enjoy this disconnection when the realization hits me like a ton of bricks. I look around the cafe in a panic. All around there are people - people that look like me, eating, drinking talking and being NORMAL. But I’m stuck. I spin around - remembering that a few years ago they got rid of the people working here - everything runs via the net. As I spin around looking around and feeling cut off a roomba spins past me carrying someones food.It’s ok, I’ve got this. I walk up to a couple in their late-20s. They’re eating pho. My favorite dish (I think?).  Hi, excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt but my access to the net is down. Would you mind ordering me some food?As soon as the words are out of my mouth I realize what this looks like. I’m in a restaurant harassing customers, appearing like a madman, telling weird tales of being cut off from the net. The couple exchanges a glance - barely registering eye contact - and in that split second I realize that they have likely exchanged an entire conversation between them over blinkchat. My brain feels like a bike compared to their Formula 1 race cars. I feel my cheeks blush and I stammer something about being sorry to interrupt and rush out of the restaurant.–Hands deep in my jacket pockets I brace myself to the cold outside and walk fast down the street. I’m trying to make my brain go faster, better, to THINK dammit. What’s wrong with me? I can’t seem to focus at all - the dopamine loops in my brain have been optimized for so long to respond to instant, all knowing, information that I’m basically a nervous wreck without it. I imagine a mess of wires inside my brain all plugged into the wrong slots - connections firing without purpose, data flowing but me being unable to process the output. I imagine those poor guys pulling information out of filing cabinets in my brain. Sound the alarm! Red alert! We’re back in action fellas!–I’m still stung by the experience in the restaurant - the look in their eyes as they looked at me, through me - a horrific sub-human being incapable of ordering via the in-restaurant mesh. What happened to paper menus and human waiters eh? What was so wrong about all that?"

    "content": "I worked as a visual librarian when I was a young man living in Paris. A custodian of all the images, photographs, paintings and media humanity had produced.My job paid pennies and the collection was poorly organized but I enjoyed spending my days unearthing and exploring the image library. Removed from the fast paced urban living this collection of images - most designed to excite and stimulate - were calm and serene. In between boxes of photos I would stumble on advertising slogans and catalogs of rejected logos. Life size prints of magazine covers. Dust motes in the air somehow the disjointed hyper-stimulating collection calmed me.But frustration walked in the door one day in the form of the professor. I never learned his name but I did learn to despise him. Trained in architecture and working at an advertising and communications agency (while painting at night I came to understand) the professor exclaimed that he had seen every kind of image. No new images or visual media were left in his life. And he blamed me for being unable to find him new images.His imagination he claimed was exhausted. There was no more progress possible. And it was my job to satisfy him. To present him with some image or style or visual that he had never seen before.At first, as custodian and, humbly, expert of the visual archives I thought it a fun challenge to find something new.Gaudi. Pointilism. Chinese architecture. A catalog of colors. Pinhole photography.Everytime I brought the professor something he would take it in silence only to return the next week and proclaim that he had seen it before. Or that it was nothing more than a simple recombining of other derivitive forms.A book of germs was my greatest mistake. A rare 1929 thick leather bound book filled with plates painstakingly photographed through a simple microscope I thought the images arresting and fresh and somehow more urgent and important than anything else I’d give him.But when he returned with the book the look on his face was thunderous and he proceeded to lecture me until the sun went down and I missed my train home on the essence of originality and how biology and life was the most banal and reducible forms of image. Everything was biology! He exclaimed. These germs are the very mother of all images! I see them in literally every single visual scene I can imagine!And he proceeded to tear down stacks of books and empty drawers of posters as he pointed and demonstrated what was to him the same image again and again and again.My mind has not seen a new image in 20 years! Everything is but a shadow of what I have already seen! There are no new mediums and no new images! I fear we have reached the end of the visual medium!And clutching his head he rushed from the library leaving me with nothing more or less than settling dust, a single dim light overhead, scattered books and images and the crushing emptiness left behind by the weight of the end of image.Already late at night and with much tidying to be done (and anyhow as mentioned I had missed my train) I resolved to spend the night in the library. I would find an original image. I would search and strain until no image had been left un-looked at.Slowly the library returned to order. I swept and cleaned and tidied as I went but slowly and methodically as I went row by row browsing and considering all materials. I vowed to find the orignal-image-needle in the library-haystack.Eventually. With a tidy library and a fresh stack of items pulled and assembled from the archives I saw the sun peeking up out of the windows and I went home. Over tired and exhausted but quietly confident I had found original image. Surely they were obscure and to my eyes (young though I was) shared no lineage with images before or after.All through that week the stack haunted me. I knew it was a promising collection:A book on pirate flags from 1830 - written and illustrated by a real seafaring pirate.The complete archives of a small accounting firm which included diagrams and doodles in the margins of the paperwork quite unlike anything I had ever seen.A set of photographs that were untagged and unlabelled found nestled in between old magazines. I could not make out the subject or even how they had been taken but they possessed some quality that deeply unsettled me.And finally, fresh the day before, the full rejected suite of marketing materials for a brand of men’s suits that folded before the marketing materials could be unveiled. Created by a young advertising student at a local University the marketing was at once bad and original. Too literal and boring while containing some desirable insight that made me want to question every fashion decision I had ever made.The week passed like agony. Time dragging and my stack of materials taunting me with their immovability. Until eventually the professor returned.He swept in Saturday afternoon. It must have been raining outside because his rain jacket was dripping and he had the air of someone who’s head has been ducked down to avoid the wind and rain.Without stopping to take off his jacket or remove his hat the professor strode confidently into the library and with a small nervous nod from me picked up the stack I had prepared.Perhaps it was the tension in the air. Perhaps it was the rain outside and the professor did not want to leave. Perhaps it was simply the urgency he felt but the professor stopped at one of the tables by the door. My curated images in his hands, the rain dripping from his coat sleeves still he flipped quickly but methodically through the images. Making sure he saw every one.I looked at him without breathing. Waiting with tension for his verdict.Once he had finished the professor slumped back in the chair. A raindrop fell from his hat onto his cheek and rolled mournfully down his face as if the heavens were crying through him.Enough. He said. Almost too quietly for me to hear. And then again. Louder.Enough!ENOUGH! How is it that there are no new images left! How is it that I am able to understand and anticipate and deconstruct every single thing you show me? Nothing here is more interesting than a row of grey bricks on an unremarkable house in a grey city of shallow visual boring nothingness!!He was shouting now. And standing. Arms raised above him clearly aiming his frustration and anger at me but broadcasting at the same time to the gods in case they happened to be watching or listening too.You might think this powerful man with some heroic ability to understand all imagery would have cowed me but something in me snapped. I had been dancing around this library for months attempting to please him and I had worked hard to discover original and obscure works but nothing had been good enough for him.Taking the professors anger as my own I jumped to my feet shouting words that are now lost in history. Like a madman I was screaming. Whatever it was I said it clearly took him by surprise because he staggered back, taking the rain hat from his head with eyebrows raised.But something had changed in me. I stormed to the nearest pile and started ripping and tearing up pages, taking posters and making confetti, turning books into crumpled balls of paper. Scientific papers filled with diagrams from hundreds of years before fell in tatters at my feet.None of this sated my rage though and with temperature rising I continued to destroy and remove images from where they had been filed and bound and organized. I grabbed a pen - whatever had been at the front desk and I scrawled on the back of a shred of poster I had just destroyed:Original never before seen images.And then in a bundle under this “cover” page I shoved scraps of books, photograpsh, canvas, art, science, words, diagrams and every other thing.As I assembled them I kept scribbling and writing putting words on and across and over the images. “Original”, “new”, “image” or on a photograph I would write “boring” and on a painting I recognized as a piece of cubist art on canvas I wrote “lines never seen”.Eventually my whirlwind energy began to die and I felt physical exhaustion setting in. I took two large binding clips and bound my “book” together and thrust it into the professors hands.There! I proclaimed. Original images!And it was my turn to collapse into the nearest chair. Full and utter bone bending tiredness overtook me completely.The silence hung in the air and eventually I looked up at the professor.With a thin firm smile spreading across his face my eyes met his and we knew. Somehow. I had done it."

    "content": "Descending into Iceland from orbit is breathtaking if you do it right. Often you can see the northern lights, the glaciers and the glass spires of Reykjavik all contributing to a stunning vista. On my most recent trip however an absence of solar flares and cloud cover meant that I sank into a dull grey fog as the cruiser landed in Reykjavik, as if the city hid some troubled thoughts. I certainly did.I've been visiting Iceland for the past 12 months regularly to interview, in person, Layola - the first human being with DNA successfully manipulated via CRISPr technology. In 2018 Layola received advanced recombinant DNA configuration across her whole genome using CRISPr - essentially using natural machines made of proteins and RNA to artificially switch some of her genes on and off. The purpose of the procedure was to cure her severe autism and the procedure took 12 months of intensive treatment.Layola was the first human to receive a CRISPr procedure and the only human to receive the procedure since.There is no question that her autism was cured, and Layola will tell you she is happy with the outcome, but to call the treatment a success requires understanding the full effects of the treatment spanning Layola's behaviour, her pre-frontal cortex, the inner workings of international medical advisory board (IMAB) and 50 years of quarantine in Iceland in a glass box and with limited contact with the outside world.--In the period 2000 - 2018 Autism was a common diagnosis. Poorly understood, we lumped the condition with ADHD and tried to pinpoint the cause on vaccines, gluten sensitivity in diet, pre-birth oxygen flow, ambient 5G radiation and many more besides.--Layola was born in 2000 in southern New Jersey in a region called south shore - now completely submerged - to two parents, Marshal and Alice. Loving parents, a middle class family and a child with autism. First diagnosed at 4 because of early learning difficulties and later confirmed aged 7 because of extreme sensitivity to touch, a lack of all spoken language and avoidance of eye contact.Aged 14 Layola was sent to a privately funded retreat - where she was supervised 24/7 by carers and given a secure compound to explore, play in and call home. What was going on inside Layola's mind at the time was largely misunderstood at the time but her externalities were extreme. Severe self harm, extreme aversion to human contact, complete and utter dependency on specific sensory inputs such as sounds and colors.In 2018, 50 years ago this week, Layola was selected and approved for CRISPr gene recombinant therapy.--\"I suppose, you could start with the words. That was the first thing I remember coming out of the autism. I had been processing sounds my whole life but never in any organized fashion - but to hear words and speaking as you and I are now - that was something entirely alien and foreign\"Layola speaks with a quiet confidence, at once soothing and calculated. Each word carries a pause behind it as if each word is selected based on it's own merit, no word more or less important than the last.--The facility where Layola lives is difficult to describe favorably - a modest secure building in downtown Reykjavik, once the cutting edge of design, connected grid-living and security but long surpassed by the technology companies now crowding the downtown skyline and subway advertising.Still, every year the IMAB and the CIA renew their contract to secure the building 24/7 with an armed staff and every 5 years a carbon/neutron probing appraisal is made of the 20-foot thick concrete walls surrounding the building. Further security details, habits, quirks and insights that I've picked up visiting Layola's home over the past year are omitted from this article at the request of the CIA.--When I asked if she was happy in her home, there was a pause followed by the measured response of \"I suppose I've never known more or less but all my needs are met and I remain content.\""

    "content": "Gormen is my horizon and my home. This towering city of red rust stuck on the side of a dead asteroid. This crumbling outpost a legacy of a crumbling empire.I am seven when the Computer chooses me as the next Controller of Gormen. Aghast, I rebel in the only way a seven year old can. I run away. Through the corridors and hangers of this decaying city of red rust, I flee. Pursued by a great horror that I can't name but I can feel - I flee through the great hall where the daily meal is being conducted - hundreds of people dancing in a mad orchestra of routine and tasks to feed the workers - I flee still.Through the lower levels the people of Gormen are covered in red dust, the red rust of this place literally killing them from the outside in.You never truly escape the red dust but as you climb through the the levels of Gormen somehow the air becomes thinner, purer, less dust.I run.I flee through the sleeping chambers, where the bodies of dormant workers appear like hulking beasts. To me, they appeared non-human, grotesque perhaps. Vile. Noises and smells that my seven year old body, as yet, doesn't understand. I flee past the air vents - constructions so big that I have to crane my neck to comprehend them. Their thundering noise is somehow calming to me - reassuring that this city is still breathing, still alive, still doing what it should. The mechanics of this community are alien to me - workers and machines and servants and the high court and the mess halls and the engineers and the scientists and cooks and... I don't understand. I can't understand - just like Gormen the meaning of this place is layered up - layers of people, metal, rust and routine.I run.As I ascend Gormen to the higher levels, the noise retreats and is replaced with the glow of lighting that is too bright. Too false. The people are no longer covered in red rust but their eyes reflect the false light. They are empty and lifeless - motions devoid of the quickness and primal qualities of the workers of the lower levels. And yet here there is less rust. Less dust in everyone's hair, in everyone's clothes.The library. A place I've been many times for education but never on my own. I see the librarian coming towards me and truly see with my eyes the monstrosity of a creature half man, half machine. Oil sheens on his metal surfaces while his human eyes burn with a look of knowledge that appears demonic. A creature who has traded form for knowledge - to give up his humanity to become all-knowing. All knowing and ponderous. I can easily outpace him and this, finally, gives me my first taste of freedom. These upper levels are steeped so thickly in tradition and etiquette that it is as if the whirling system of people and things move only in regimented movements, a limited finite way of being - destined to repeat infinitely again and again their movements and conversations.Still I run.I lose my way more times than I can count - dead end passages, locked doors, great halls that are colder than death itself. I stumble into a room filled with dancing lights, flickering and beautiful but when I see the faces of the trapped people - wired from every part of their body and a state of rapture on their faces, drooling and muttering and smiling and laughing an empty sickly laugh, I turn and flee. Those faces haunt me as I stumble on - still running and still scared but now I have been running for so long that I am feeling free - the solid pounding of my feet on the metal floors of Gormen reassuring me that this is physical and real.What characters will there be in this story? The spiders of Gormen - the computers’ eyes and ears forever creeping on, and over everything. The rust, of course. Spick who will become my best friend from the miners - his infectious laugh and real human energy in his eyes but lacking the understanding of education. Mervyn - my assistant and mentor forever faithful but forever lacking, bound to the rituals and mechanics of the system. And Braun - the first voice in the senate and the puppet master of the upper levels. But there is plenty of time for that.Still I run.Down a long, narrow corridor I emerge into the observation deck. A hundred windows blazing with the radiance of the carpet of stars in the night sky. It will take me years to find this place again, and the next time I see it somehow it won't be as beautiful as this time. Seven years old and heir to the whole of Gormen, I am able to put aside the looming dread and gaze out across the surface of the moon. Is the towering construction of metal and people Gormen or is the moon Gormen? Where does one truly end and one truly begin? I can look out over the valleys and mountains of the moon - everywhere tinged the same red color - and look up at the stars. Like pinpricks in the curtain of night, they hang motionless and yet twinkling. I am tired and lie down to rest. Rest perched on the very edge of Gormen - as far from the belly of the beast as I can manage. Many miles overhead the machines we call crows wheel and toss in some imaginary wind buffeted by space and tracing some pattern known only to the Computer. I feel for the crows out there in space with no air and no heat. How can those machines not lose their minds? Already my brain is confusing humans and machines - already my perception of things is losing it's grip.I will look back many years later, once I have become the Controller truly and know every chamber, every air vent and every crack in this majestic ruined place - once I understand how the rituals work and how the machine functions - the system made of humans and metal, of brains and computers. I will look back and wonder what did I know of Gormen as a seven year old? Gazing out from that observation deck - what did I know of the true nature of Gormen? This spiraling city of red rust. Perhaps, I will think, I knew it better at that age than I ever did again."

    "content": "Nothing about his job was rewarding for Jonah. He worked day and night at the quantum observatory research lab attached to the New Frontier science outpost orbiting Aries12.Our understanding of time and space have changed in the last 100 years, what begun with relativity, was extended through quantum mechanics and then later entangled-thermodynamics upended our notions and our understanding but ultimately very little changed in our day to day. Yes we were able to master short wormhole transportation but only in isolated channels through our solar system, at short distances from the energy harvester orbiting the sun.Using this we catapulted a short number of expeditions to some of the nearest stars and inhabitable planets around Earth.It was on one of these space hops that Jonah and Franny fell in love. 30 years ago. Both quantum scientists they spent their entire education learning how to entangle molecules, only to end up entangling each other in the emotions of love.But Jonah was destined for Aries12, and Franny for Aries13. And with a limited distance using the hops from our home solar system Jonah and Franny are separated for the rest of their lives. Without even any means to communicate other than radio waves with a 20-year lag. And, of course, the entangled beacons.12 in total, designed to withstand the ravages of space, stabalised in 5 dimensions using a combination of magnetic and gravitonic fields. These entangled beacons are linked outside of space/time. Across space/time. Using space/time. Really, it's impossible with our understanding still to determine HOW entanglement works. But work it does. Instantly. So Aries13, 20 light years from Aries12, itself 10 light years from Earth. Each with a series of entangled beacons capable of communicating 12 bits of information in total. 1 or 0. But able to communicate instantly.The game theorists on earth had calculated a complicated matrix of scenarios, and an associated chart of communication patters guiding the use and interpretation of these quantum beacons. So far two beacons had been used. One signaling that Aries13 was indeed habitable, that all was safe and that resources were abundant and one signaling that resources had stabalised and colonization had begun.But of course you can't leave two amorous quantum scientists together for 10 years on a lonely voyage through space without expecting them to entangle themselves. Both literally and metaphorically. You see in addition to the 12 \"official\" quantum beacons Jonah and Franny had created 5 entangled particles, held in simple crude quartz chambers "

    "content": ">In 2019, nearly twenty years into the modern gig economy, constructing our identities primarily in terms of how we relate to the paycheck folkway is no longer good enough. After all, there is a good chance the gig economy will outgrow the paycheck economy, relegating the latter to a minority sector of the economy overall. Imagining our future in relation to the future of paycheck work would be like early industrial age workers imagining their future in terms of the future of farming. Much of the supposed “future of work” thinking I see around the gig economy strikes me as the equivalent of early factory workers worrying about where to park their cows.>>So the gig economy needs to outgrow its origin story in the paycheck world. For the gig economy to grow from limited sideshow to full-blown folkway, we need to talk about a lot more, and develop much deeper internal realities and subjectivities.source: [Towards Gigwork as a Folkway](https://artofgig.substack.com/p/towards-gigwork-as-a-folkway)-->I think the question of whether or not to outsource curatorial practice is a good opening to discuss the broader practice of outsourcing in general in the cultural heritage sector. It certainly easier for more people to relate to than the question of whether or not we should outsource digital and technology roles. This is a larger debate that we, as a community of practice, should have because I think that one risk of relentless outsourcing is that museums (and friends) will become nothing more than centers of production rather than scholarship.>>If we say that our only purpose is to facilitate the assembly of content in the service of culture then it's no longer clear to me what distinguishes the cultural heritage sector from any other for-profit entertainment company. If we are unable to articulate, even to ourselves, what distinguishes our work from that produced by the private sector then maybe it really is time to admit there's nothing special about what we do. And importantly there are other people who do it — where it is pure and selfish entertainment — better than we do.source: [[this is aaronland] it's like trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich in a toaster](https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2019/11/25/toaster/)"

I wondered what would happen if we could combine the magic and power of video games, with the rigour and reporting of journalism? What if we could make a really good news game?source: https://robinkwong.com/storytelling/–  Collective Wisdom is a first-of-its-kind field study of the media industry, that maps works that live outside the limits of singular authorship. While the concept of co-creation is entering the zeitgeist, it is an ancient and under-reported dynamic. Media co-creation has particular relevance in the face of today’s myriad of challenges, such as the climate crisis and threats to democracy. But it is not without risks and complications. In this study we look at how people co-create within communities; across disciplines; and increasingly, with living systems and artificial intelligence (AI). We also synthesize the risks, as well as the practical lessons from the field on how to co-create with an ethos grounded in principles of equity and justice. This qualitative study reframes how culture is produced, and is a first step in articulating contemporary co-creative practices and ethics. In doing so, it connects unusual dots.source: Collective Wisdom · Works in Progress–  But what about their information architecture? Almost all of them are built in a feed structure, while the information architecture of the Internet is almost completely hidden behind the scene. There is no ‘Facebook homepage’ that presents updates, requiring you to click on the update, go to the update page, and then click back to return to the homepage.source: News media should rethink their website architecture–  “Rappers got their start by releasing rawer, uncut mixtapes to the streets. These tapes were more frequent, less polished, and had samples we knew damn well weren’t cleared! But once the artist got popular, their studio albums were more polished, had radio-friendly singles, big-name producers, and a slow song or two to broaden appeal.  When artists focus on albums and stop making mixtapes (or mixtape-type music), they risk losing the audience that fueled their rise. But if artists stuck only with mixtapes, there’s a higher chance they might never breakout. Doing both allows them to grow while staying true to their roots. That’s why Lil’ Wayne’s run from 2005-2009 was so iconic. He released classic mixtapes and albums to maintain both audiences.”source: How Tyler Perry Built a Customer-Centric Empire - Trapital by Dan Runcie"

They could master the skill of traversing multiple streams of information flowing through our increasingly digital lives. And they could teach that skill to patrons, unleashing a wave of creativity and empowerment in the communities they serve.source: Libraries in the Digital Age: A Case Study in Equipping Librarians with the Tools of Idea Management–  We need to develop — both among library patrons and librarians themselves — new critical capacities to understand the distributed physical, technical and social architectures that scaffold our institutions of knowledge and program our values. And we must consider where those infrastructures intersect — where they should be, and perhaps aren’t, mutually reinforcing one another. When do our social obligations compromise our intellectual aspirations, or vice versa? And when do those social or intellectual aspirations for the library exceed — or fail to fully exploit — the capacities of our architectural and technological infrastructures? Ultimately, we need to ensure that we have a strong epistemological framework — a narrative that explains how the library promotes learning and stewards knowledge — so that everything hangs together, so there’s some institutional coherence. We need to sync the library’s intersecting infrastructures so that they work together to support our shared intellectual and ethical goals.source: Library as Infrastructure"

You’re much better off learning to use the basic commodity diagrams well than trying to make up and sell your own in most cases.source: Basic Consultant Diagrams - The Art of GigBen Thompson of Aggregation theory famehttps://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/Toby Shorin of Subpixel Space famehttps://subpixel.space/entries/diminishing-marginal-aesthetic-value/https://subpixel.space/entries/each-binary-contains-a-universe/Mark PollardAll the good stuff is on Instagram: @markpollardNahee cyberdiagrams (nsfw)The best instagram account I follow.

We think at first of drawings and diagrams, but there are other forms of sketching. The OED offers several pertinent uses of the term, none of them earlier than the late 17th century. The first refers to the visual arts: “A rough drawing or delineation of something, giving the outlines or prominent features without the detail, esp. one intended to serve as the basis of a more finished picture, or to be used in its composition; a rough draught or design. Also, in later use, a drawing or painting of a slight or unpretentious nature.” The second extends it to literary creations: “A brief account, description, or narrative giving the main or important facts, incidents, etc., and not going into the details; a short or superficial essay or study, freq[uently] in pl[ural] as a title.” A third, rare usage, makes a sketch simply “[t]he general plan or outline, the main features, of anything”. One can find all three sorts of sketches at work in the formation of the new science of the seventeenth century.Source: Sketching Science in the 17th Centuryhttp://www.xplaner.com/visual-thinking-school/https://twitter.com/nicolasnova/status/1376581318637670400https://davidhoang.substack.com/p/sketching-as-a-strategy?ref=uxdesignweeklyhttps://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/https://syllabusproject.org/diagrams/https://www.oarplatform.com/response/cartography-research-process-visual-essay/https://syllabusproject.org/diagrams/https://www.are.na/sim-polism/psychoanalysis-diagrams"

As important as this emphasis may be, we mould argue that it is seriously limited, that the process needs to be viewed from a wider perspective so that the variety of ways in which strategies actually take shape can be considered. For over 10 years now, we have been researching the process of strategy formation based on the definition of strategy as 'a pattern in a stream of decisions' [Small groups and consultancy](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/10/07/small_groups_and_consultancy) - by the ever brilliant Matt Webb:> I don't think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company's nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it's not thinking straight, that the organisation isn't put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.[The art of sharing](https://www.epicpeople.org/the-art-of-sharing/) - Jan Chipchase is a master at this and I can't wait to read the full handbook but this excerpt is especially relevant for the sharing / campaign thinking I mention above.[Consultancy, Creativity and Cooking with Sunday Dinner](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consultancy-creativity-cooking-sunday-dinner-lindsey-slaby) - from the great Lindsey Slaby thinking about new ways of getting creative projects staffed, funded, connected and thought about.

I.e. a new type of work or one that the org does infrequently so has no way to efficiently monitor the quality of work.This maps well to my idea of ways of seeing - i.e. teaching clients how to see the work is another way of saying teaching clients how to monitor the work. Dashboards rule everything around me.Clients have problems that they describe as \"I don't know how to build this\" when what they mean is \"I don't know how to measure this\".-->Yet beyond being (cognitive) labour saving devices models have another obvious virtue. They provide a shared intellectual scaffolding: a common ground upon which people can interact and engage. In that sense models have communicative virtuosity - they are good to talk with.

In that discourse, “productivity isolates and sanctifies the actions of individuals. It elevates an elite class of worker beyond the concerns of mundane others.” Productivity fetishism suits a society of free agents who must continually renegotiate the terms of their value, their viability, their irreplaceable contributions; it not only provides a rationale for employers to sort contract workers, but it provides those workers a way to frame their achievement in the absence of a stable association to a particular job or a particular set of co-workers. More and more of us are perpetually in the position of a baseball player facing an arbitration hearing. We cast everyone else as the replacement-level people that we are besting with our superior performances. To garner proof of that, we’re more likely to tolerate increasingly invasive forms of surveillance that can document our accomplishments and chart our personal growth on whatever metric is necessary, whichever seems to give us leverage over the competition, if not the employers.source: [Not Relevant for Fantasy Purposes — Real Life](https://reallifemag.com/dispatches/not-relevant-for-fantasy-purposes)--[High performing teams](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CwT4q7bSQSIn8BPm7Xcoiy1Q8funZD8PwH-E2ShmCzo/edit#slide=id.g5267a7edd3_2_12)--[What theorizing is not, theorizing is](http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Doctoral_Resources/Weick_What_theory_is_not_theorizing_is.pdf) - (pdf)-->Learning results from the adaptive and manipulative interactions between an organization and its environments: experimental actions are important because organizations rarely master their environments so that they can develop lasting optimal responses... Long-term survival calls for surveillance of opportunities, whereas short-term coping concentrates upon problematic search. Most organizations have much of the latter and little of the former (Thompson, 1967). Yet, if organizations are to survive in hostile and changing environments, they must change strategies and pursue new development patterns. Organizational design should encourage experimenting so that organizations attain long-term viability.source: [How Organizations Learn and Unlearn (Hedberg, 1981)](http://johnljerz.com/superduper/tlxdownloadsiteWEBSITEII/id167.html)--[Contextual Wireframe Presentation by 𝐌𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐦 𝐋𝐞𝐲𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐡 on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6179363-Contextual-Wireframe-Presentation)-->A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.” No wonder Deloitte’s Reimagining Measurement initiative, which asked more than 125 social sector leaders what changes they most hoped to see in the next decade, identified “more effectively putting decision-making at the center” as the sector’s top priority.source: [Why Your Hard Work Sits on the Shelf — and What to Do About It](https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/this-is-why-your-hard-work-sits-on-the-shelf-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it-a7ca5e063038)-->I think we have trouble justifying architectural investments in software engineering because, unlike in the automotive factory, our systems machinery is hidden away in a data center or “in the cloud.” However, if we demonstrate rigor and get creative about exposing the machinery to the CEO, the justification may become a lot easier.source: [Expose the Machinery — Resilien](https://www.resilien.tech/blog/2019/9/10/expose-the-machinery)--Indy Johar - The boring revolution Systems thinking, complex systems.-->You came in as the high end consultant on rarefied air.  But then you stick around, and the luster wears off.  You eat cheeseburgers for lunch, just like everyone else.  And, after a bunch of months, you don’t seem as special as you used to.  Just one of the crew.source: [The Siren Song of the Long Term Engagement - DaedTech](https://daedtech.com/siren-song-long-term-engagement/)This is wrong!

Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it. Because of this, information scientists suggest other methods: search, more flexible than navigating folders; tags, which allow multiple categorizations; and group information management. Yet Bergman and Whittaker have found in their pioneering personal information management research that these other methods that work best for public information management don’t work as well for personal information management.source: [Managing our digital stuff](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/science-managing-our-digital-stuff)-->Seeking is finding things out and keeping up to date.

It’s about exploration and process as much as it’s about expertise and “being right”.To that end - I’m fascinated by this idea of “small groups consultancy” from Matt Webb:  There are a couple of things I’m investigating:  1) That a small group is a powerful way of thinking, and of creating action. That repetition matters, and informality.  2) It might be possible to help with strategy without providing original thought or even active facilitation: To consult without consulting. The answers and even ways of working are inherent in the group itself.  My hunch is this: To answer a business’s strategic questions, which will intrinsically involve changing that business, a more permanent solution than a visiting consultant might be to convene a small group, and spend time with it, chatting informally.You’ve really got to read the whole post here: Small groups and consultancy and coffee mornings.Open questions:  What kind of problems need this “small groups” approach?  How do the commercials work? Who gets paid what? Who has incentive to make this work?  What other models exist outside of traditional consulting?"

We cull the most striking, typical and atypical images from thousands of pages of print that will not be available online. As the internet increasingly becomes the main source for designers to draw on precedence, RNDRD hopes to provide a broader sample of the history of architectural image making.source: [About | RNDRD](https://rndrd.com/about)->Once cities were designed to accommodate the masses; today the masses have to be seduced. During the past forty years, like all sectors of the economy, urban planning has become free enterprise: a perpetually speculative activity, which must give shape to developments even if it remains uncertain whether those developments will ever happen, or attract the people for whom they were planned.> This presentation explores the flipside: large urban plans that were built but never used. These now occur on every continent – the inevitable fallout of a world urbanizing at a staggering pace.

People who make completely different choices than I do and have completely different values, but are nevertheless very happy. How they think about meaning. The ecology of our changing planet and the adjustments we'll have to make to adapt and survive. Navigating objectification, and learned self-objectification, in a society that places great value on female beauty and youth. How to communicate clearly and kindly in high-stakes situations. Technology and its effect on productivity. Strange possible worlds. Fear, vulnerability, loss of control. Surprising statistical truths.

Within the first few pages, I wanted to reach across the fifty-year divide and clasp hands with the author. MacCallum asks, “Is a hotel a community?” and proceeds to explore the idea of “proprietary communities”, such as shopping malls, airplanes, and RV parks, where unaffiliated individuals are bound by the contracts they make to the proprietor of an organization. MacCallum argues that sovereignty (or “institutionalized force”) is merely an awkward transition between “primitive” and proprietary communities, both of which represent the true best form of social organization. (Unsurprisingly, his grandfather was an ex-Georgist.) I didn’t agree with everything in this book, but it left me with a lot of good questions. It made me think about the ways in which big tech companies are also proprietary communities (consider the recent WIRED piece about Google’s internal culture!). It also gave me some missing vocabulary I’ve needed to express how one-to-many communities are structured differently from many-to-many communities (ex. an open source maintainer is often a sole proprietor who allocates scarce resources, like attention, on behalf of all contributors). I desperately want to talk to someone about this book; it looks like I snagged the last copy on Amazon, but it’s also available via Internet Archive here.

Legitimately gripping—I stayed up late to finish the last one—and totally literary. Also: usefully contemporary, with some very nice depictions of some deeply unglamorous tradecraft, including one detailed sequence that follows a character on the run and manages to make VPNs thrilling.From Robin Sloan–Jitterbug perfume–https://www.dukeupress.edu/technocrats-of-the-imagination–Chris Butler: The Dark Beyond the Stars?

This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin’s power to shapeshift,[note 1] on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells.source: Merlin - Wikipedia–A universal theory of BusinessMagikMerlin was the OG consultantOf kings and queens and consultants (and mages and jesters)Business functions like a monarchyThere’s a reason we talk about samurai and freelancersSkills of the mage (consultant):  Scrying  Soothsaying  Truth-telling  Divination  Spells  Wisdom–“Ideas about a person’s place in society, his role, lifestyle, and ego qualities will lose their hold as the cohesive forces in society disintegrate.

    "category": "wiki",
    "content": "This post is a draftIt was a lonely Tuesday, the 24th of Feburary 2015. I left the office late, without fanfare. It was my last day at the company and no one seemed to notice. This was a client of mine, I’d been working out of their office 3 or 4 days a week for two months as their interim VP of marketing. Sooner than expected they found someone to come on board full time and that was the end of my engagement.I’m dramatizing slighlty but the insight is true - there’s a gap between consulting and in-house work. It’s often postioned as an either/or choice when in fact the truth is more nuanced. Most of my consulting engagements should naturally end in me hiring someone to continue the work and processes that I’ve helped to set up.After all, strategy without execution is worthless.The Lightbulb MomentThe second half of 2015 I landed on a new client. After an initial workshop I walked out the door with a clear vision that they needed to hire -  needed to build a new marketing team to support the kind of growth they wanted. So I got stuck in. I believed in the company I was working with, thought they had a great team already and they paid well. I reached out to my network to help find the right people for them.This engagement helped me realize a few key things:  Building a marketing org is hard if you don’t have any marketing leadership already  Hiring itself is a skill and a lot of young companies are not good at it  There is a lot of value in a network and reputation built up in the industryWhich leads me to my current new mission:I help mid-size startups solve marketing problems and build marketing teams by providing strategy and connecting them to marketing talent.How I Got HereI started my career in SEO - the nuts and bolts of keywords, analytics, link building and content. I came to New York in 2011 with Distilled, to open a new office and build a new outpost for the company. Looking for something new I jumped to Google for a couple of years where I worked with the Creative Lab. In late 2014 I went out on my own to build an art business with Erin and start my path as an independent.The past year and a bit I’ve spent consulting. Mostly marketing consulting, sometimes SEO consulting. I had high hopes for the kind of work I’d be able to get out of the gate and the lesson learned in 2015 is that spreading your wings is like growing a flower - consistent, slow, deliberate work. But sped up over a timelapse it’s incredble to see the range of motion and the amount accomplished.Why Recruitment?Why am I going to be good at this?  I have a strong network of diverse people across startups, marketing and tech.  A deep expertise in marketing allows me to truly understand both the problems a client is facing and the kinds of people who will be good at working on those problems.  I’ve done a lot of hiring over the yearsNBED more here.Consultant vs Recruiter?Every mid-stage startup in NY is looking for a head of marketing these days... and almost none of them know what they&#39;re looking for.&mdash; chris muscarella (@cm) December 30, 2015This tweet is true - though a little strongly worded in my opinon. There are lots of things that mid-stage startups don’t know what they’re doing! That’s the fun of it. But it’s true - marketing and growth are abstract concepts for a lot of mid-size startups. They’ve not yet defined all of the inputs and outputs and haven’t figured out processes. So they look for someone to lead them through the answers to these questions and to build a team.But these are two different things.It’s important not to choose too soon. I’m obviously biased but a good consultant can still get deep in the weeds and help you think about problems in different ways while providing incredibly fast execution and a flexible approach. A lot of my work this past year has been on-site with clients, embedded with teams and helping to add advice but more importantly help show my client how I think, how I approach problems and provide some experience about what works and what doesn’t while recognizing that each problem needs a fresh pair of eyes and an open mind.In short, just because you’re struggling with growth doesn’t mean that hiring a “VP of growth” will solve your problems. Often, founders feel like they don’t have the marketing experience or knowledge to manage and lead a marketing team. But for the most part that’s not true - yes as the company grows hiring a manager to lead the team makes sense but to think they’ll solve all of your growth issues is naive.Here are some things to consider before hiring a full VP marketing:  A workshop with the leadership to figure out marketing goals, objectives and activities. Often there are plenty of things that are known to be worth doing but just haven’t been done yet. That doesn’t need an expensive VP marketing, that needs doers. People who can execute with a bit of experience.  Working with an agency to execute some specific deliverables - the nice thing about a lot of agencies is that you get access to a wide range of talent, ideas and experience. Work with the agency on the specific deliverables but don’t forget that they’ve seen a ton of different clients and know what works and what doesn’t.  Working with a consultant to come in-house and sit with your team, especially if you have a junior team that can learn from having someone physically present.(Spoiler alert: I can help you do all of the above! Who said this was an unbiased blog post eh?)The 18 Month MistakeJust quite how bad is it to make a mistake with your head of marketing? Back of the envelope math says something like:  3 months bedding in  3 months of work in the wrong direction or on the wrong things  3 months of extrication, pain and eventually termination of contractThat puts you 9 months in the hole. But then there’s the opportunity cost - you’re now 9 months behind where you would be if you’d hired the right person! Who would about now be 6 months into working on the right things and building the right way. Oh, and it’s going to take you 3 months to find the right person and bring them in after this mess.All of which is to say that hiring is important, delicate and sometimes the benefit of hiring a consultant is that you can stay agile while still getting some forward progress.Some Guiding PrinciplesHiring is serious work. The concepts of work, money, employment and health insurance are not to be joked about. I’ve been involved in hiring people of both genders, many races and diverse backgrounds. But there’s more to be done. I’m just starting out but here’s a few things I think are important:  Equality - spend more time working with and supporting women, minorities and those without a priviliged background.  Longterm thinking work with candidates and companies beyond the inital hiring.  Education educate companies on best practices for hiring and treating candidates fairly and kindly.  Human recruiting be kind and considerate to all involved, no spam.Basically - give a shit about the people and treat everyone with respect. This means getting involved well before and beyond just the moment of hiring. I’ve been involved in building positive cultures when I work in-house, what does this look like inSo get in touch!The magic always happens over coffee doesn’t it? Let’s chat.

If you work in SEO in New York you probably know who I’m talking about.Every week I’d travel on-site to New Jersey and spend the day in a meeting room surrounded by executives, product managers and - crucially - a consultant from a big consulting firm (I think it was Bain but I actually can’t remember). No one around the table knew SEO as well as I did, but they sure did have strong opinions.A question would arise about the cost of doing link building. An exchange might go something like this:Consultant: We need to know how much it costs to build a link for our financial modelsMe: Ok, first we have to have a discussion about the kind of links we want to buildConsultant:Meanwhile, over lunch in the cafeteria one of the in-house SEO folks turned to me covertly and showed me xrumer - a piece of desktop software that builds thousands of links through automated submissions and so on.Not only was Xrumer theConsulting Is ImprovGood Consulting is Improv Without the BullshitYou could also call this codified experience.

When you’re trying to make change it’s important to understand what kind of change you’re looking for and choosing the appropriate tool for the job. Pretty much everything I know about effective consulting I learned from my brother and he wrote a nice piece on better business documents where he outlines the pyramid of documents.I always try and follow this model and will switch between formats and medium often during a consulting engagement depending on the work. For example - here’s a taste of the range of work produced during a single client engagement (some work I did for the New York Times Cooking site a few years back)          This is largely because I used the term ‘consulting’ when I was doing client work at the agency Distilled pre-Google.               .This can be helpful - especially if you explicitly take the time to really think through who your audience is for a given recommendation and think about what medium will suit it best (sometimes multiple mediums!).But this is only scratching the surface.The New Consultant’s Toolkit - Mockups &amp; PrototypesWhile the above framework is useful, recently I’ve found that I can be far more effective by getting closer to the output. What do I mean by that? Well - documents are almost never the actual output we’re looking for. Usually we’re looking for teams to be hired, or landing pages to be made or videos to be shot etc.Imagine we were trying to convince Etsy to allow videos within product listings. One piece of the puzzle might involve a simple screenshot faked up using inspect element:The modern web is such a remixable medium that I urge you to think how you can build an MVP or prototype of the change you’re recommending. The most simple way to do this is using inspect element in chrome to change up a site and then take a screenshot. Being able to see language, design and formats in play within the very medium we’re discussing can be very effective. Here’s a screenshot of a prototype I built for a client to demonstrate an idea:There are a million different tools to generate mockups and prototypes (which is the beauty!) but my goto tools are:  Chrome’s inspect element for small changes and tweaks (protip you can take mobile mockups this way too using the device switcher, and even add a device frame to the screenshot too)  Google slides for mockups and more design-focused work. Read more about how I do that here.  Glitch for functioning prototypes andThis approach will help you get closer to producing recommendations and ideas that resemble the finished product, that’s a good thing. But it still doesn’t answer the central question - who are we trying to convince, and what objections do they have?"

    "content": "I have room for one or two more clients in 2018. The conventional wisdom is that you distil your experience into a tightly crafted positioning statement. A tidy little zen koan on the work you do and who you do it for.This view of the world however is tightly constraining. It doesn’t account for different modes of work with the same client. Or an evolving skillset over time. So instead I’ve written 10,000 words exploring the landscape and the work.I chose the word landscape to emphasize the idea of surveying the terrain - looking out from a small rise and seeing which rivers and streams seem most fruitful. Of course the map is not the territory.And the work - the craft - is the heart of the work. As an independent this work can be varied in nature. From interim CMO to strategic advisor and trusted advisor.How I Got HereLet’s first take a quick pass at how I got here.SEO had a moment where an SEO agency could dictate overall digital stratetgy. While that’s still true for a subset of organizations where organic search is dominant (not just large but dominant). But in 2011 for example you could have meaningful conversations with a company like GucciBut in 2018? If SEO is your business - as an agency or consultant - then I think to remain strategically relevant you need to either expand your horizons or double down on helping those companies where search is a dominant channel.So I took a leap, went to work for Google. Shifted my thinking into a wider brand, org, user insights Unfortunately instead I decided to write 10,000 words on the work vectors I’m interested in right now, how I got here and where I’m going next. I’ve told it through the lens of three tensions. Brand/Publisher, Strategy/Implementation and Consultant/Advisor.The Media &lt;–&gt; Brand ContinuumI’ve been a consultant for four years now and you can basically summarize my work by looking at the Brand/Media spectrum and realizing that I help companies push one way or the other.[Diagram of brand &lt;–&gt; Media]On the left hand of this spectrum you have “brands” - what I’m calling traditional businesses. People like Olapic (a B2B saas platform) or Fundera (a B2B small business lending platform). People with a product. On the right hand of the spectrum you have media companies - folks like The New York Times or Complex Media. These folks don’t have a product but rather content is their product.Content/Product. Is the content the product or the marketing?However, in the middle of the spectrum you have some interesting weird middle ground businesses - typically affiliate businesses. They produce content at scale (sometimes outpacing traditional publishers) and monetize in new and interesting ways. Companies like Nerdwallet or The Wirecutter.What brands wantNon-media company businesses are often:  Narrative poor  Purpose poor  Distribution poor  My work involves helping companies connect their brand and their purpose, often internallyWhat media companies wantMedia companies are often:  Lacking branding  Devoid of user insights  Revenue poorMy work here involvesWhat affiliate businesses wantUsually a mix of the above - better narrative, better brand, better insight into their users.The Brand/Media EcosystemIt’s an interesting ecosystem right now where brands and publishers are increasingly looking like each other. The New York Times boughtWe’ll see:Acquisiitons - so publishers buying brands and, more likely, brands buying publishers. This will take even more of a leap of faith than The NYT buying the Wirecutter but it’ll make sense. Ringfence the editorial teams but integrate the content product into the core brand product.Ecommerce - brands going D2C, publishers creating products and merch. Influencers creating merch.What do I do here? Help everyone act like the others.Strategy &lt;–&gt; Implementation continuumThe secondWorkshops as ways of seeing. Radically challenging existing beliefs and mental models within an organization.The implementation of strategy is slow and messy. It often involves hiring and building teams.Strategy work is an unfolding network of associations. How can you create working environments that reflect that? Workshops. Off-sites. Ethnographic sessions. Bringing users into work.Case study: FInsights &lt;–&gt; Tactics BalanceInsights and execution are a tightly coupled dance. Yin and Yang.Consultant &lt;–&gt; Advisor ContinuumThe third tension to explore here is the consultant/advisor spectrum.Often clients engage with you around a defined problem and end up sticking around to help with undefined work. Connecting to agencies and other service providers. Coaching on mental models. Strategy sparring sessions. Emotional regulation. Ways of seeing.I like to think.2018 is all about weaving through these tensions. Brand/Publisher, Strategy/Implementation, Consultant/Coach. Every engagement spans different spaces here."

    "content": "https://www.amazon.com/Geography-Nowhere-Americas-Man-Made-Landscape/dp/0671888250Rem Koolhaas provided context for modern space - for modern living - in his 2002 essay Junkspace. In the essay Rem provides a glimpse of the flattening, commercializing and colonizing of space:  “Junkspace is post-existential; it makes you uncertain where you are, obscures where you go, undoes where you were.”Airports, air conditioning and aesthetics crash into each other to create a nothing-everything space that sprawls, and subsumes our physical environment.Koolhaas uses the airport as the first spaces to become Junkspace. Out of time and out of place, the airport becomes everywhere and nowhere.In his essay Welcome to Airspace Kyle Chayka sees the bridge between the digital and physical, noting that digital technologies are re-shaping the world around us:  We could call this strange geography created by technology “AirSpace.” It’s the realm of coffee shops, bars, startup offices, and co-live / work spaces that share the same hallmarks everywhere you go: a profusion of symbols of comfort and quality, at least to a certain connoisseurial mindset.In other words, the Junkspace of airports has become the Airspace of everywhere. Commoditized comfort. CBD-cozy.But technology is not satisfied with the “connoisseurial” spaces of coffee shops, airports, restaurants, hotels and bars. Technology is eating the world and it’s hungry.Our experience of space is transforming once again - because every space now is a dual-space. Wherever we are, we are also in digital space. Our physical space - junkspace - airspace - is now just a backdrop for an equivalent junk-digital-space. The airport, once bastion of large bright shared screens is now just a row of seats with faces slumped into our personal screens.Every physical space is now secondary - there is no physical space left that is the primary place we are. We are always primarily in digital space and secondarily in physical space.Yes, physical space has been conquered.The world is being terraformed - not by physical changes in space (like junkspace and airspace) but by replacing space itself. Space has been replaced with digital space, and digital space is nothing but feeds as far as the eye can scroll. Junkfeeds.From Junkspace to JunkfeedsHow do we understand where we are in digital space? How do we orient ourselves?The answer, in 2019 is feeds. Every commercialized, flattened, colonized part of digital space is now a feed - junk-feeds. Junkfeeds.Once confined to Times Square this bright, flashing, garish, predatory environment has extended through our screens into every single moment in time and space. At home on your phone at 11pm? Slouched in the dark over your screen there is a times square in your face. Garish, bright, loud, flashing.Junkfeeds scroll endlessly in front of us. Disorientating us. Destabalizing our sense of oursleves and our sense of the world.In this way, junkspace has been digitized and replaced by the screens in our hands. From Junkspace to Junkfeeds.Junkfeeds are post-human, radical, tech-utopias that pollute our knowledge and police our information.Once recognized as the great frontier of architecture and modernism, junkspace is now just space. It has been fed into the machine and overrun by junkfeeds.The architecture and space of Junkspace will get “better” - fewer screens, tastefully designed. Because junkspace is no longer junkspace it’s just space. Background space. The star of the show is Junkfeeds.Quote from here? https://medium.com/dark-matter-and-trojan-horses/the-city-is-my-homescreen-317673e0f57aThe most well-known starchitect should be Zuckerburg.Orienting in digital space via the feedThe problem started because digital space has no edges. Craigmod writes:  Edges are about feeling as much as seeing. With edges comes a sense of weight. And with that comes the ability to feel — physically and psychically. And with that, a better understanding of what we’ve built and where we’ve been.https://craigmod.com/journal/digital_physical/This can be re-framed as the lack of edges: Edgelessness is about lack of feeling and not seeing. Without edges is a sense of weightlessness - the loss of ability to feel physically and emotionally.Digital edge-less spaces creates a lack of feeling and a disorientation.The answer to this is the feed: a way for us to reorient ourselves around something. Not around an edge of “space” (because digital space is infinite) but around the edge of “time”. By orienting everything around the feed of objects sorted by time we regain some logic - some sense of an “edge”. The edge of time.The reverse-chronological-feed created a logic in infinite space to orient by. An edge-like structure.Feeds drained of humansThe reverse-chronological-feed began on blogs. Websites that required effort to update, posted via RSS that created slow-moving chunks of information.Technology and platforms upended it. As technology becomes quicker, boot-less, always-on, always-with-us screens became the norm at the same time that platforms began coopting the feeds as their own.As platforms commercialized it was inevitable that they recognize the power in making us feel disorientated.Facebook was the first - accelerating the feeds (add your entire phone book!). We began to stuff our feeds with junk - the sources which used to be the selected, slow-moving websites became the mass-selected faces of everyone we’ve ever met (and plenty we have never met).The feed is crammed with more sources, that are able to post ever smaller chunks, to devices that we check increasingly often.It quickly becomes apparent to the platforms that these reverse-chronological feeds are no longer working.Facebook is the first to blink - they move to the “news feed” that is algorithmically ranked and ordered.The feed - once oriented around time - becomes disorienting. Where once there was a logic there is quicksand - no way to know or be sure of anything or anyone. Why this piece of content? Why now? What am I not seeing?This is the moment that feeds began to become junkfeeds. With the logic removed the platforms are free to accelerate the disorientation.But even algorithmically curated feeds are not fast enough. Platforms need to remove humans entirely from the process to keep up with our insatiable appetite.Google was the first major platform to completely break this - the Google Discover Feed (which shows up on the homescreen of Android phon and the start page on Chrome) is now entirely divorced from humans. No longer is content presented to you because you asked for it, or because someone you know shared it, or because someone you know interacted with it, just… because Google said so.  “Junkspace is often described as a space of flows, but that is a misnomer; flows depend on disciplined movement, bodies that cohere. Junkspace is a web without spider; although it is an architecture of the masses, each trajectory is strictly unique.”A web without spider!This quote about junkspace sums up junkfeeds - feeds are just flows of information! But they depend on coherent information, checks and balances. Junkfeeds have no checks and balances (or at least none that make sense). They are flows without discipline - flows without thinking. Information that does not cohere. Incoherent shouting.And junkfeeds are personal. Everyone gets their own personal junkfeed - in fact every user gets their own set of junkfeeds. One on Google, one on Facebook, and on and on.This suggested content feed is the true, purest Junkfeed. Not because it’s the worst - but architecturally it’s the most pure. No pretension of humans. There never were humans here. Based entirely on the premise that Google knows you.Junkfeeds are radicalWe consume junkfeeds in every moment. Shitting. Fucking even. Twitter, Facebook, Google Assist, But YOutube too. Instagram.Junkfeeds are radical. Extreme. They are forcing functions to push us to the edges.We check our feeds when we’re anxious. And junkfeeds make us anxious, radicalized, paranoid, scared, angry.The algorithm does not recommend - it reflects. It’s a machine for turning our own biases against us. Literally programmed it is a recipe for turning depravation into clicks.  “Junkspace pretends to unite, but it actually splinters. It creates communities not of shared interest or free association, but of identical statistics and unavoidable demographics, an oportunistic weave of vested interests. Each man, woman and child is individually targeted, tracked, split off from the rest.. Fragments come together at ‘security’ only, where a grid of video screens disappointingly reassembles individual frames into a banalized, utilitarian cubism that reveals junkspace’s overall coherence to the dispassionate glare of barely trained guards: videoethnography in its brute form.”Two-clicks away from paranoia.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.htmlFacebook is a space for communication. For groups. For friends. Except it actually tears us apart. Junkfeeds feed us neither things we need or want. Things that are designed to divide us and agitate us.Junkfeeds are non-localThe topography is unchanged (the territory) but that’s less important than the topology. The change has gutted local news. Small towns are now unable to sustain local news as global junkfeeds gut the economy while plugging the people into a grid. The map is not the territory! In fact the map is no longer a map but instead a feed. A junkfeed scrolling endlessly.The Junkfeed as a tech utopiaThe discussion of the junkfeed as being able to influence and radicalize us is the pinnacle of technology accomplishmentLike the scientist creating Frankenstein the monster “it’s alive!” the scientist doesn’t care about it’s current use but rather that it exists and functions.The junkfeed is not immoral it is a-moral.

Slack has ushered in a post-email feed-based environment. But Slack’s collection of feeds are mostly pre-junked. They’re not yet algorithmic (it’s only a matter of time).But actually the real terror is in feeds of work scrolling through the gig economy. An upworker’s dashboard of jobs is a junkfeed in a different way - controlled by algorithms in a differnet way. The algorithm dictates which upworker appears in which searches.Above/below the API line from VGRFrom Bifo:  From the standpoint of capitalist valorisation, this flow is uninterrupted and finds its unity in the object produced; however, from the standpoint of cognitive workers the supply of labor is fragmented: fractals of time and pulsating cells of labor are switched on and off in the large control room of global production. Therefore the supply of labor time can be disconnected from the physical and juridical person of the worker. Social labor time becomes an ocean of valorising cells that can be summoned and recombined in accordance with the needs of capital.  The organization of labor has been fragmented by the new technology, and workers’ solidarity has been broken at its roots. The labor market has been globalized, but the political organization of the workers has not. The info-sphere has dramatically changed and accelerated, and this is jeopardizing the very possibility of communication, empathy and solidarity.Users to Junkusers?I’m optimistic for the future though - teens, raised not web-native but feed-native, junkfeed-native, are increasingly creating protection for themselves. They do not see identity:user as 1:1 rather many:many. They create throw-away accounts and trash existing accounts with abandon. They have learned to turn themselves into junkusers to shield themselves from the junkfeeds.Users turn themselves into junkusers.

Desperately trying to turn ourselves into Junkusers so that we can retain some agency, autonomy.But autonomy and identity are done. They’re dead. Luxury concepts reserved for the high-minded.After the future of junkfeedsWhere to from here? Will time continue to get subdivided. Junkfeeds become hyper-junkfeeds? On our wrists - in our ears - inside our eyeballs?I wonder if the solution is not slow-tech, and slow-feeds and RSS but in fact the opposite - we have a better chance of resisting by creating hyperfeeds. Sub-second-notifications that create a literal unbroken stream of junk. By twisting these feeds into a post-human form only then might we rediscover what it means to be human. Surrounded by high-frequency-feeds like high-frequency-trading we can let the feeds manage the feeds and perhaps gain some control again.Production of content is still mostly human today - but there is a smell in the air. Change is coming. And junkfeeds, fed by junkcontent will accelerate the problem. Further pushing underground junkusers who seek to protect their identity and personal space in the seas of change.Welcome to a junkfeed world.–Hold your own.Junkfeeds are incoherent by design.

A fractal reward for playing the junkfeed.The subtle soothing reassuring voice of Instagram saying “you’re all caught up” sits in stark contrast to the reality of a 4-dimensional infinity of infinite feeds within the app. The “feed”, stories, activity feed, “search”.

But we need to see these feeds differently — let’s print them, interrupt them, archive, redistribute, and inhabit them with new agendas. With the help of artists, archivists, and activists, let’s de-focus our gaze and look for breaches, breaks, and leaks that resist smooth flow. Let’s teach ourselves new ways to see. How else to prepare for total uncertainty.–https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flows  Castells then discusses new media and communication technologies based around networks, arguing that they are contributing to a fundamental change in culture. The new development is a ‘culture of real virtuality’, which describes a culture that is organized around electronic media.[3] He says that ‘the space of flows and timeless time are the material foundations of a new culture’,[6] that of the network society. The concept of ‘timeless time’ refers to the collapsing of time in global informational networks, for example automated financial transactions.source: The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture - Wikipedia–https://twitter.com/robhorning/status/1186663941734326272–https://mailchi.mp/cb0071e0a9a5/kneelingbus-852561?e=a68912ab79https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/architectural-intelligencehttps://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/https://www.cnet.com/news/teens-have-figured-out-how-to-mess-with-instagrams-tracking-algorithm/“To be truly countercultural in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self.”        @documentjournal https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/https://fakepixels.substack.com/p/fkpxls-the-illusions-of-free-to-play"

    "content": "In my previous posts I’ve talked about the idea of seeing an organization’s culture. Understanding the culture of interactions, beliefs and so on.This is well and good and gives you a good mental model of an organization to work with. But practically, as soon as you walk in the door the day to day is governed less by culture and more by specific power flows.Understanding who controls the power, who influences who and how decisions get made is critical to understand in the first 30 days of a consulting gig.Every Consultant is an Org Design ConsultantConsulting is not about fixing things or building things - it’s about helping your client fix themselves or build their own thing. But! Sometimes the best way to teach someone to fish is by doing it and letting them watch first.“Org Design” is a fancy way of saying getting things done.##While all of the above references the idea of culture - in truth every individual inside an organization has their own view of the culture. And each individual’s view is often dictated by their relation to power structures. Who are they subservient to? Which individuals have an outsized impact on the culture and which are relatively neutral? Understanding the personal culture of the CEO can be as powerful as understanding the whole organization’s culture.When I start a new client project I start sketching a simple org chart of boxes and lines. It’s the best you can work with on day zero but org charts are too simplistic. As Venkatesh says about org charts:  “A good deal of the process is about imposing anxiety-alleviating platonic structural beauty.”SourceThe org chart of boxes and lines maps reporting structures (kind of) but little else. The org chart only tells us about the topology of the organization, i.e. what are the connections? It tells us nothing of the topography, i.e. the lay of the land. The messy distortions.The real org chart mental model of the organization is much more like this:This from a fascinating analysis by Carta into influence inside their organizationThis network-model showing a small number of highly connected nodes maps well to the lived experience of working inside a messy organization. Knowledge work environments are almost exclusively highly networked and stream-ified places now.But again - these networks and nodes and actors only tell you so much about power. Relational power dynamics are everything and as much as you’re understanding culture inside an organization you need to understand the flows of power.In the early days of a client engagement - watch and listen closely and as soon as someone says or does something that doesn’t make sense. When something that usually or rationally would lead to X but instead leads to Y you’re usually missing a hidden undercurrent of power.Notice turns of phrase, rejected ideas or a statement that turned the room to silence. These mis-steps are power potholes in the consultant’s path. Notice them, write them down, meditate on them and try and ask yourself: what power structures exist here to explain this anomaly?So start on day zero with a crude org chart. In the first week convert your org chart into a network graph and as fast as you can (usually in the first few weeks) augment this network map with the key power players.Reference: https://miro.com/blog/features/graph-visualization-understanding-collaboration/?utm_content=94438573&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-508685581https://twitter.com/artofgig/status/1136316756967002119https://slackhq.com/shared-channels-growth-innovation"

    "content": "This is post 4 in the networked communities blogchain with Brendan Schlagel. To recap briefly:  We want to weave a public web but why don’t we blog more? Brendan explores barriers.  We introduce the idea of “sidewalk spaces” that create communities &amp; blogging as a social act  Brendan explores positive gatekeeping and ways to intentionally keep communities small by limited membersWe’ve talked a lot about spaces. But what kind of spaces are we talking about?In my post building a digital garden I talk about the idea of streams, campfires and gardens as different kinds of digital spaces:  Streams are for information discovery and banter. Think fast feeds like Twitter.  Campfires are gathering spaces, connection forming spaces and places to think. Think plces like blogs.  Gardens are long-term memory palaces, remembering spaces, archiving spaces and knowledge growing places. Think wikis.Of course, no analogy is perfect and the uses of each platform vary wildly and overlap. But broadly speaking the Campfires analogy feels most at threat (perhaps?). The idea of spaces to actually hang out online, not fully public like twitter but faster than blogs?Algorithms vs SidewalksI think this might be one reason why algorithmic feeds betray us - they destroy the notion that we’re in the feed together and instead make us together alone.Instead from the perspective of the platforms (“seeing like a platform”) the “right” behavior is to create private group chat threads (e.g. whatsapp groups). But these are private, not semi-public like sidewalk spaces need to be.Of course this idea isn’t new:so many intense and lively twitter debates should just be held in an ephemeral read-only discord channela lot of real-time nuance, dialogue, and clarification are lost in these monster threads&mdash; quadrillion dollar coach (@ryandawidjan) December 7, 2018There is a large graveyard of websites, apps, startups and ideas that have tried to crack this digital sidewalk / digital campfire space. Perhaps they’re forever doomed to be built, abandoned and reinvented over and over again. Maybe that’s ok.After all - coffee shops and local sidewalk spaces shift and change all the time.Conductor NetworksThere’s a temporal problem here though - streams are “always on” and blogs/wikis are basically completely async.What if there’s a new way - by windowing our attention to time windows to create attention, draw people together and form community. This is the “campfire” section of the analogy but with a deliberate attention to being present at the same time - something blogging really lacks today.This idea is explored in depth by Cody Brown in his post Conductor Social Networks          If you don’t have a Medium account remember they’re always free to read coming in via Twitter               :  There is a human scale feeling to the space that is so completely lost when I sign in to Twitter each morning. It’s like the difference between entering a concert hall and waking up in The Tower of Babel.he goes on…  Alt Shift X uses fairly run of the mill broadcasting software (an app popular with Twitch streamers) but I think he’s tapping into something big that feels like an emerging category on the rise. For lack of a better term, I call this category, “conductor social networks.” A musical conductor’s job is to artfully pull music from an orchestra, and in this case, a conductor does the same but for information, conversation, and/or whatever the conductor desires.Conductor social networks have two core features:      The conductor has a real time ability to drive an audience to whatever space they want them to be in.    Once the audience arrives, the conductor has a baton and a podium. They have an ability to communicate, listen and keep order however they choose.  Press Space to EnterThese conductor networks and communal hang spaces are fascinating to me. While we’re all busily engaged in seemingly real-time feeds there’s very little communal real-time hanging out online anymore.And there’s a graveyard of these “real-time” hang spaces.Anyone remember turntable.fm?Well there’s a new kid on the block:Anyone else enjoying poolparty.fm right now? It’s a funThis idea of concurrency is powerful:  This is what I assume is the driver behind so many people thinking about intentional digital third places. Carving out a pool that they can control more with a sense of discovery that isn’t overbearing… yet can accommodate the flexibility of asynchronosity (that’s the word deal with it) that we simply expect. Waiting for the signal that the water is fine.source: The Concurrency PoolMusic is the glueRemember the campfire analogy? There’s a reason music is a key feature of the campfire chat. To keep people hanging around in real-time you need one of two things. Focused attention or ambient attention. Focused attention is something like a specific conversation or debate, perhaps a performance of some sort. Something that requires you to be there.Ambient attention is something like music - it allows for drops in the conversation and focused attention so that you can stick around comfortably in the same space but without words. Just hanging.I’ve been following this one electronic music radio station since 2009. And there’s a reason this community has been so sticky - despiteHangspaceBut, what if there’s another way to keep a community small - not by limited members but by limiting the time window?Cody recently explored the idea of “pop-up social networks” in his great piece conductor social networks:  There is a human scale feeling to the space that is so completely lost when I sign in to Twitter each morning. It’s like the difference between entering a concert hall and waking up in The Tower of Babel.It’s a mistake to think of a twitter thread as a blog post equivalent.While some twitter threads become immortalized and evergreen mostly the distinction between a twitter thread and a blog post is that it’s real-time in the feed.This is an important distinction.Barriers to EntryThat said - maybe there’s light at the end of the tunnel. As software gets cheaper and “easier” what if we can build our own little sidewalk spaces? Socket.io makes this trivially easy. There’s an example on Glitch that shows how to build a real-time chat room using socket.io.I forked that to make my own chatroom.

Four short years separate us but in the blink of an eye a generational change is manifested.Not long ago I woke from a dream where I could feel another generational undercurrent: the coming identity crash.There’s a certain generation (my generation!) that grew up with dialup and pioneered the digital frontier. We put ourselves online and we boomed as a result.A significant effect of this for me is the idea of digital identity. I’ve been Very Online since my teenage years in a variety of handles, guises and forms and although my handle, username and identity has changed over that time there’s been one constant.Interactions online have been mostly 1:1 between digital identity and real identity. i.e. when you’re interactingBut as I look at my daughter and son (3.5 and 0) it occurs to me that there’s something changing.Where I have invested time in my identity (tomcritchlow.com / @tomcritchlow) the next generation will not understand what this means. They won’t even understand how or why it could have happened.Machine Learning and AI will take our jobs, yes, but it’ll undermine our sense of identity too. Every interaction will come with a vague sense of unease as it’s faked (russian bots), augmented (gmail smart replies) and substituted (chatbots) by machines and state actors. Individual identites will become hard to prove and hard to defend, hard to stomach in the face of organized identity machines."

    "content": "Venkatesh just posted a banger:  There is a renaissance underway in online text as a medium. The Four Horsemen of this emerging Textopia are:      Roam, a hypertext publishing platform best understood as a medium for composing conspiracy theories and extended universes.    Substack, a careful and thorough ground-up neoclassical reconstruction of the age-old email newsletter.    Static websites, built out of frameworks like Jekyll or Gatsby (full disclosure: a consulting client).    And finally, Threaded Twitter, a user-pioneered hack-turned-supported feature that has wonderfully revitalized the platform.    I want to take a stab at lightly theorizing this renaissance. And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of blogging. And the future of books. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy hot take on the State of Textual Media. Or at least a simmering take, since I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a year on the backburner.You should read the whole thing - and I don’t disagree with Vgr, the landscape of blogging is shifting and changing. Where Venkatesh explores technologies I’m going to explore themes and see where we get. Consider this a side of fries to enjoy alongside the Ribbonfarm burger…Wither the IndexesAn index is a curious thing. PageRank - search on static sites.Simple sites with simple curation is still powerful and I think an under-represented aspect of the modern web.

But Gatsby and Jekyll both handle this gracefully and easily with something that is more like copy and pasting than installing.What happens when Medium implodes?Will the writing return to blogs? Dev.to has exploded as a niche Medium-esque writing destination. Perhaps the collapse of Medium will see a bunch of more focused writing verticals emerge?Broken CommentsDisqus is failed and… what will replace it?

It’s weird how often this is how it ends  up working. You might talk for hours, but in the end, it’s one casual phrase or thought that ends up unlocking the critical idea. My very first client said as much to me — that after twenty hours of chatting, the value I delivered all came out of one phrase I happened to drop casually in thinking through a problem: “penny auction.” Two seconds in twenty hours.That pattern has repeated for nine years. Hours and hours of conversation and emails, punctuated by scattered moments of high-leverage usable insight — a phrase here, a 2x2 there, a particular quote or metaphor that fits the situation. It used to frustrate me a lot initially. Was there no way to cut out all the hours and just formulaically arrive at just those moments of insight? So far I haven’t found one. You have to put in the time — and learn to enjoy it.Venkatesh Raohttps://artofgig.substack.com/The unit of progress for consulting is sparring sessions:Strategy is not a single point in time powerpoint deck.

For instance, research suggests that being open minded shapes your mood and makes you more creative. “Open people are more curious, creative, and motivated to explore the world and engage with possibilities,” write the researchers.It’s not hard to imagine why: open-mindedness fosters curiosity, which in turn results in better creative input. It also fosters metacognition, so open-minded people will tend to make more space for self-reflection and interesting questions. Finally, open-minded people may be less driven by fear of failure compared to closed-minded people. The creative process involves learning through trial and error, which includes many failures before arriving at the desired result.Another research study conducted with 340 college students found that open-mindedness may be linked to higher cognitive abilities. We don’t know if being open minded makes you smarter, or being smart makes you open minded, but these two traits seem to go hand-in-hand.@ness_labs https://nesslabs.com/closed-mind-to-open-mind"

    "content": "In this post I want to break down what I mean by “strategic independent” and why, whatever path you’re on and expertise you have, you can bring more value for yourself and your clients by thinking strategically.We’ll walk through:  What strategic work is - by looking at a variety of contexts you might work within and how to spot them.  Why strategic work is better - both for you and the client, offering more value to them and being more interesting for you.  How strategic work enables you to charge more - and keep clients retained for longer, a compounding effect on your ability to charge more.  How you can begin to think strategically - offering some real examples from my own career.Finally, how being independent offers more value for your clients by enabling you to gain adjacent context that your client might not be able to see and that we get this adjacent from our network - and therefore we should really think of being codependent with our network.Onwards…Strategic work is work-in-contextClient work can be frustrating:Ever had a project cancelled without notice?Ever had to go through endless revisions and feel like you’re not getting it?Ever had a project stall before it even started because you can’t agree on the exact deliverables?Ever had a piece of work never get implemented by a client?But frustration is a two player game - when you’re frustrated that work doesn’t make sense - the client is likely frustrated that your work doesn’t meet their objectives well enough.Context is the key.Even before I start working with a client in the very first meeting I always make sure I ask questions about business model, team structure, company priorities and more. These don’t always feel relevant to the specific request but help me better map out both the work I need to do and the stakeholders that need to see it.The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context          I wrote a whole post called ways of seeing that explores ideas around sensemaking inside an organization               .The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context1.Overlapping contextsSo when I talk about strategic work - it’s about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you’re designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts          This model seems… obvious? Except I’m always surprised at how often consultants and agencies fail to properly explore the wider contexts of the business either before starting work or during their engagement.               :However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might also exist within a variety of people contexts:Every project exists in multiple overlapping contexts - here’s some of the types of context to look for:  People (who are the stakeholders? what do they care about?)  Resources (what can they realistically do with your work?)  Brand (what is the position of the company?)  Marketing (audiences, channels, analytics)  Business model (revenue, profit)  Product (how does their product work, what is possible?)  The user (who is the user? What do they care about?)Your work likely overlaps at least partly with all of these ideas - but also depending on your specific work you might have different contexts and add more nuance.Strategic work is better workOnce you understand the concentric circles within which your work happens you’ll be able do work that’s more effective and useful for your clients.Two examples from my own work:Scenario #1I was working as a marketing advisor for a client and early in the engagement (partly because we were discussing me becoming the full-time CMO) I was invited to sit in on their quarterly board meeting. This experience was formative in better understanding the drivers and motivations of the business - by understanding who literally owned the business better. This context was crucial for proposing work and for ensuring that pitching that work to the board was smooth. The CEO gave me some of the necessary context but by attending that board meeting I got a vantage point that I didn’t realize existed previously.Scenario #2Last year I was working with a client to integrate an acquisition into the main business - in particular to ensure that one business function was working correctly. My north star and most of the language in the team was about revenue projections for the function. Makes sense. But, I discovered that actually the SVP’s OKR for the quarter was ensuring that the business unit was functioning smoothly. While revenue was obviously a thing that they cared about, the more important context was around process and communication around that process. Once I had this context everything became easier since I could be more closely aligned with the objectives of the business.Catastrophic Events &amp; Context CollapseThere’s a certain kind of experience that I want to describe where everything goes to shit. Certain events in business collapse the environment. For example - let’s take that context model for app design from earlier in the post. But let’s assume that the growth objectives are “in crisis” - this could be missing targets, people change, overspend, change in marketing strategy etcThese catastrophic events collapse the environment and cascade downwards. Every circle inside gets ignored, paused, cancelled, changed, redefined. These events are felt like system-shock for anyone operating in these lower circles          Not available for graphic design work.               .But for those above the fire-line there are two things that are crucial:  Their objectives and priorities haven’t changed much, they’re still operating within the same context they were previously (although they may feel some turbulence)  They likely knew about the catastrophic event ahead of time. They may even have been responsible for causing the catastrophic event.We’ve likely all been personally inside a context as it collapses - either as a full time employee or a consultant / agency partner. It’s not fun.Riding these crashes is a skill that I think in theory you can get good at - learning how to sprint at a moments notice in a new direction and operate supernaturally fast in a crashing environment.But I think it’s way easier to instead always be searching upwards for more context awareness - i.e. working strategically. This helps you ride out those catastrophic events with more planning, awareness and foresight.Strategic work is better paidIn addition to being better work (for clients and for you) - strategic work is also better paid.As an independent - you’ll hear a lot of advice boil down to “charge more”. I’ve even said it myself! And it’s true - it’s the best advice you can get. Except… it’s kind of empty advice. I don’t think it provides much direction for how exactly you go about doing it.Translating executional work into strategic work is a framework that I think gives concrete ways of continually ratcheting up the price &amp; value of your work.The key idea is that at every layer of context there are new kinds of work - and by reaching for associated layers of context you can get involved in new kinds of work that are associated with and grounded in the thing you know but also a slight stretch.Not only can you charge more because the work is more useful, impactful and better but you can also charge for the associated parts of uncovering context - workshops, user research, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews etc.Let’s look at two examples:Scenario #1 - From Writing to Strategic WritingLet’s imagine you’re a writer - commissioned to write for a client’s branded content site. Let’s say you get paid $200 per article. The work: writing. How might we think of writing-in-context? Here’s a list of context that you should ask for and where it’s not available or it’s done poorly offer to step in:  Creating a style guide for all the writers  User research for end users to uncover what they want to read (e.g. by creating personas)  Competitive analysis for other branded content sites, who writes for them and how they operate  A content marketing plan for the branded content site  A content marketing plan across the whole brand  Themed content franchises that can scale beyond individual posts  SEO research into keywords they care about targetingScenario #2 - From UX Research to Strategic ResearchLet’s imagine you’re a UX researcher - creating user research from real users for clients. The work: creating user research projects, finding relevant users and running them. This is likely reasonably well-paid work as-is but let’s look at ways we might take this UX-research and place it in-context:  Creating a set of product principles based off user research  Reviewing a product roadmap  Running a design sprint internally to ideate new product ideas (grounded in user research experience of course)  Proposing a broader marketing focus group studySome more examples of how work and associated context work might fit together:  Work: email copywriter -&gt; context: brand voice document  Work: paid marketing -&gt; context: paid marketing dashboard creation  Work: marketing strategy -&gt; context: hiring a marketing teamI’ve got a very loose working theory that every time you expand your context-circles you get paid an order of magnitude more money.It’s not unreasonable to imagine:  Writing: $200 / article  Style guide: $2,000  Content strategy: $20,000These are necessarily imperfect analogies and will vary wildly from industry to industry          I’m keen to hear more stories of different kinds of work where people have navigated this shift into wider contexts - email me!               , but here’s a specific callout as you start to bundle “the work” and “the context”:Don’t give the context work away for free. In fact, do the opposite - charge more for it than your regular work.I see this often with more junior or less confident independents - you’re trying to close “the work” and so you throw in “the context” for free or as a sweetener.Don’t do this! Work-in-context is typically more expensive than regular work so don’t be afraid to price it separately and confidently. Don’t worry if the client doesn’t bite at first - strategic work is only valuable at certain inflection points (see below graphs) but they’ll remember that you offered it and it’ll come back around.Strategy and Stewardship - a framework for retaining clients for a long timeSo we’ve established that you can get paid more money for strategic work - and now I want to show you that the new higher rates you’re charging can also last longer. A compounding effect on your pricing power.I learned about the model of Strategy &amp; Stewardship from the Helsinki Design Lab:  It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop          Page 40 of Recipes for Systemic Change by Helsinki Design Lab        Their solution? Strategy and stewardship:  We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural steward          Page 15 of Legible Practices by Helsinki Design Lab        This idea of a feedback loop between strategy and implementation is one I’ve taken to heart. It maps directly to my mental model of a typical long-term retained client relationship.Imagine a 12-month client retainer with the strategic work in green and the implementation in blue:You can see that (roughly) the total amount of work is constant but there is a phase shift from strategy at the beginning to mostly execution &amp; implementation (stewardship) and then a hard shift back into strategic work.If you look at strategy on its own:There are two key things to draw from this chart:The long-term work begins with strategic work, so if you want to get involved in a project early (a common request) you have to be thinking and working strategically.But importantly, if you only do strategy work the client isn’t going to keep you around for months 3-12.  No matter how lucrative that strategy work is, if you’re not shifting your outputs to implementation/stewardship then there isn’t enough work for either you or the client to justify sticking around and so you end up with a short sprint of a project.Now, if you look at execution on it’s own:There are two key drawbacks to only doing implementation/execution work:Firstly - notice how the blue line shoots up a few months into the project? When you’re only working on the execution/implementation you get called into the project too late - the strategy is already set.Secondly - notice how at some point in the future, the client either pauses, reviews or changes their strategy and the project unexpectedly ends? This can seem like it “comes out of nowhere” if you’re only doing the execution work and not aware of the wider context.So what does stewardship work look like?So what is stewardship exactly? Sometimes it’s literally just rolling up your sleeves to do the work outlined in the strategy. Never underestimate how powerful a single reference piece of work can be - e.g. you want the editorial team to produce 1000s of pieces of content over the next 12 months - but if you create the gold standard piece of content it can get referenced again and again and become the inspiration for a whole team.So is the execution just plugging away in the trenches? Yes sometimes, but I think the most powerful stewardship work is around momentum - helping the organization or project accelerate their output. Some examples from my own work for things that look like stewardship:  Hiring &amp; building teams  Building workstreams, processes  Building dashboards and reporting templates  Adding partnerships and relationshipsIf you take this strategy &amp; stewardship approach - when the client comes to review the strategy at month 6 you’re still there working with the client and able to offer tangible and concrete insights into the work. How is the strategy evolving? Where should we adjust? What have we achieved?Using this approach the average retainer length for clients I work with is 20 months.I recall an important breakthrough for my own thinking - a client had hired another consultant to work on a project and afterwards I asked my client how the experience was and he said:  “It was fine - but he just gave advice. I like working with you because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves and do the work when it needs doing”This was a real lightbulb moment for me - up until that time I’d always worried about doing “menial” or “low-paid” work as a consultant but charging a strategy-based day-rate.But the thing I realized was that if you can provide momentum to an organization it doesn’t matter if you’re writing title tags in an SEO environment or putting together a board pitch you should do the most valuable thing the business needs at that moment.The freedom of a consultant is that you can ignore job title / role / responsibility and be laser focused on moving the business towards key objectives and mixing your outputs from small to big as needed.So, don’t undervalue either part of your work - either the strategy or the stewardship. Remember that graph up above with the blue/green strategy/execution mix? I bill it all at the same day rate. Stewardship is just as valuable as strategy and there’s no reason to somehow charge less for the execution work.Only let clients in the strategy doorSo we’ve established that the combination of strategy &amp; stewardship is important - but there’s a crucial note to make:Clients that come to you only for implementation are going to be your worst clients.Wait what? Haven’t I been telling you to get your hands dirty? Yes, but…In his book the business of expertise in chapter 10 titled “Distinguishing expertise from implementation” David Baker uses the great analogy of a building with two connected rooms and two entrances, one for strategy and one for execution.The whole chapter is a delight and the punchline is: “only let clients in the strategy door”:The argument really boils down to:  Implementation work is hard work to sell - you get poor quality clients expecting a more easily commoditized output that drives your business towards lower margins  Not only that but implementation work is often more stressful and deadline-driven  So of course do both for clients but only let them in through the strategy door to ensure that you do better, higher value and higher margin work.You should really buy the book - it’s a fast read but has lots of pieces of wisdom          There is however a shorter (older) version of this argument from David online here               .Importantly - if you accept that you can do a lot of implementation work for clients but they should all start with strategy then your external positioning should be entirely focused around the strategy work to attract the right kinds of clients.Time &amp; MoneyHere’s a funny thing - when you read the accepted literature about pricing as an independent you’ll hear again and again that pricing based on time is a bad thing          To be fair - many of the freelancer advice posts do caveat their advice saying day-rates are ok, but it’s ually a footnote and I think it’s easy to come away as a beginner only understanding that charging for time is bad. I know I did.               . And, maybe they’re right - but I’ve had plenty of success charging on a loosely-coupled time-based approach (almost all of my work is scoped at a day rate, at least to begin with).I have a theory that this time-based approach to pricing is especially powerful as you move through a context-transition.Why? Well - as you go through this cycle of exposure to new contexts and working in new contexts you are by definition operating in new types of work and new types of environments and it’s hard to control the inputs and outputs.Put simply - as you ladder up into wider contexts for your work you don’t yet have enough experience to properly scope and price the work - not to mention you may be continually expanding your context not upwards but sideways into new types of workstreams.So I say - if you’re reading the commonly accepted wisdom about pricing and feeling like you’re doing it wrong by pricing based on time let me tell you that you’re totally fine and that strategic work by definition can be fuzzy and so scoping on project work can be dangerous.My own journey out of SEOLooking back at my career - this idea of doing work-in-context has determined the path I’ve taken from SEO manager to digital strategy to consulting work.The problem with SEO is that it’s inherently non-strategic. As an activity it’s increasingly commoditized and marginalized. Not that SEO-traffic is not important or that SEO is going away, but that the strategic activities you undertake to achieve business-level goals are usually not owned by SEO practitioners or agencies          Yes, there are exceptions to this of course but there’s a reason there’s no widely recognized c-suite SEO function.               .This wasn’t always true - there was a golden age of ~2008-2012 where an SEO agency could get directly in front of the CMO to work on digital strategy. Back in 2011 when I worked at Distilled it wasn’t uncommon to be working directly on digital strategy for fortune-500 brands, in a context model that looked something like this:But I could see the writing on the wall and could feel the shift as everyone else in digital “caught up” to the competencies and experience that the SEO industry had built up over the previous decade to the point where a more traditional SEO engagement now looks like this:As I felt this shift towards SEO being less strategic I needed to find ways to expand my context and work in different types of work more directly and explicitly.When I first started consulting in 2014, yes I worked mostly on SEO projects. But I was keenly aware of the wider context and pushed myself to ask questions and be curious - whether about the business model or the teams executing the work.Over time - by asking questions and pushing for more context I was able to start to get involved in several different wider context-circles and evolve the work I do          One consequence of this of course has been a difficulty in describing the work I do. For more thoughts on describing and defining my work see my post on media design.               .How to learn to be more strategicTaking my personal SEO example above it’s hard to overstate the importance and value of being curious. Being curious about the industry you’re in and how it works, being curious about the clients you’re working for and being curious about the context of your own work is where this whole strategic independent path starts.Then, from there the path to strategic work looks something like this:  Ask questions and be curious (about the business, the industry, the people)  Explicitly ask to see surrounding context (e.g. as a writer, ask for the content strategy, as a marketer ask for the strategic roadmap)  Then, next time explicitly ask to be included in the creation of the surrounding context  Then, start offering and leading the projects to add the surrounding context  Repeat as you expand your contextHere’s a worked example from my own experience on “how to be more strategic” as I learned about brand positioning work for clients:  The first step was being curious about brand positioning - how does it work? What does it look like? I got exposed to a handful of these kinds of projects at Google and always asked questions  The second step is to keep your ear close to the ground and ask to be involved in a brand positioning workshop or project as it’s happening - just as an observer / participant.  The third step is to spot opportunities for where a brand positioning project would make sense and add value and source a partner to help with the work for a client - where I’m leading and owning the work output but working with a partner.  The fourth step is creating and running a brand positioning project on my own for a client (probably smaller to begin with while I gain confidence).This explicit evolution and experience in my own work probably took 3-4 years with the help of some friends but is exactly that ladder of context-awareness that enables you to get involved in strategic work.As you can see, this path to strategic work relies on gaining context from client work - but there’s another way to gain context - from your network.The adjacent-context benefit of independenceMost of this post focuses on the idea of context as gathered from your client and their business - but there’s another great source of context: peers.Co-dependence is really the right word for independence          Frank was kind enough to point out that in-fact co-dependence is not the right word at all! The actual definition of the word is around enabling addiction. I didn’t know that! The correct word is interdependence and Frank Chimero has a more recent post all about this topic: back to the cave. Thanks Frank!               . I’ve talked a lot about the power of the network - both as a tool for gathering leads for your business but also as an emotional support network.Frank Chimero wrote a wonderful essay I think about often titled the inferno of independence which is hard to boil down but looks at the nature of independent work - and articulates this shift from independence to co-dependence:  Listen: we only deserve what we can maintain and keep safe. A community is only as good as how well it takes care of all its members. There is no independence. There is only subservience or co-dependence. And I choose you. I choose community.Co-dependence and network building has plenty of other benefits          I wrote about using a network to build a steady stream of high value leads in my post strange attraction.                but one key benefit of a diverse network is the adjacent-context. Some of the most helpful context you bring to your clients as an independent is the context they would otherwise not have access to or overlook.Adjacent context is thinking laterally about an industry, organization or problem - looking sideways for unusual or unexpected analogies or insights into expanding contexts that might not be obvious to you or your clients. You can only get this from hanging around a blend of interesting people who are also context-aware.So then, the strategic independent is someone who not only helps bridge context inside an organization but outside as well. This distance from a client’s organization is extremely valuable - and yet another reason not to undersell the value of context before and during an engagement. Someone able to connect the dots and do work-in-context but also expand the context into new directions.Will you join me on the path to being a strategic independent?Hopefully this long post was helpful - let’s recap the main points:  Work-in-context is more rewarding &amp; more effective for you and the client  It also allows you to charge for additional types of work! Hence making you better paid  But it also allows you to work with clients over a long time-horizon, extending the length of your client contracts (a compounding effect on revenue when combined with charging more)  As you begin to shift to strategic work - start to only let clients “in the strategy door” - you’ll get better clients this way  Learning how to be strategic is relatively straight forward (even if it takes a while) by constantly looking for additional context  And, as you work in fluid context-shifting client work don’t be afraid to charge based on time - despite what the received wisdom advises.  Finally as an independent remember that co-dependence with your network is actually the ideal state and you can gain context from peers just as much as you can from clientsI’m writing a book. Originally it was designed for “independent consultants” and… that’s still an audience. But I realized writing this post that the audience is wider - I’m writing not just for those doing “consulting” or even “strategy work” but also designers, writers, researchers, leaders who are doing strategic work, independently - the strategic independent.To peek the outline for the book head over here, and you can subscribe to my newsletter here to keep updated with the latest.I’d love to hear your experience with strategic work, independence and context.

    "content": "This piece is a wonderful meditation on time and internet (sub-)culture. Bravo Aaron.One little epiphany I had reading this was around the instability of truth.Thanks to the “perfect memory” of digital media, internet subcultures are able to create their own visions of past, present, and future. The internet has freed them from the top-down schedules and narratives of mass media. With nearly all of recorded history at their fingertips, they can cherry-pick interesting scraps of information from the archives and construct new grand narratives with unprecedented ease.@aaronzlewis https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memesFor me - this ability for subcultures to create their own visions of past, present and future is very clear in alt-right and QAnon style communities where truth doesn’t matter. By sidestepping truth as a principle they are able to create much more stable and enduring frameworks for reality.The conversations of internet subcultures often feel substantive and expansive compared to the shallow discourse of presidential debates, op-ed pages, and cable TV shows. Mainstream news cycles rarely last more than a few hours, and their narratives are constantly shifting. They don’t tend to give a big-picture sense of where we came from or where we’re going. Internet subcultures, by contrast, are building grand narratives and meme worlds that help people feel their way through the chaos that’s currently unfolding.@aaronzlewis https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/07/07/the-garden-of-forking-memesThe NYTimes, by adhering to truth, and chasing the speed of events as they unfold, is unable to build grand narratives.That’s perhaps partly why QAnon is so alluring - it offers a stable grand narrative to believe in:QAnon carries on a tradition of apocalyptic thinking that has spanned thousands of years. It offers a polemic to empower those who feel adrift.Adrienne LaFrance https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/"

In particular this part:This is what I’m calling the age of the Renaissance Creator — the hybridization of the individual as both a creator and an entrepreneur. This development and definition of ‘creativity’ is one of the more interesting things happening today because it is contrary to the supposed logic for a creator to go independent. We like to say independence (see: passion economy) is valuable because it lets a creator focus on what they do best; create. But actually it’s the opposite. By going independent, the creator is aspiring to not only create, but willingly assume the management and business of their entire self. This acceptance of responsibility as a formula for success will dictate a creator’s desire to go independent and develop a micro-label or decide to limit duties and create within a larger media organization.I want to be a creator. I want to be a business.

Not about content - I’m still bullish on that. But rather I’m increasinghly wary of the “editor in chief” title when embedded inside brands.From my vantage point working across traditional media companies (The NYT, Mashable etc) and my work with brands producing content at scale (Gartner, Wirecutter etc)There are some key mistakes that get made:  The “brand as publisher” model is often pitched by creative agencies - and as a result the focus is placed on creative production. This drives the cost/content piece too high. This unsustainable price produces “good” content but leads to the brand not creating enough content to reach scale.  Through hiring an overly “editorial” folks they underinvest or neglect audience development - distribution is often heavily weighted to paid channels and they neglect the longer arc of compound organic growth through building organic distribution channels (e.g. SEO)  SEO practiioners meanwhile are often not actually very good at editorial work  Brands lack the connective tissue to conversion (e.g. email signups)So - I’m re-evaulating my positon on the “editor in chief” role. Instead I see an emerging role that I’m going to call “content ops”1Content Ops is a new embracing of the hybrid role that editorial people inside organizations need to play.Editor in chief has the luxury of publishing mechanics being “built into” the organization. But within a brand it’s not a given and many things need building or investing in deliberately. Namely:Conversion and commercialsTechnologyDistributionWorked Example: RobinHoodAPp basedEditor in chief for stock news? sure but….The role of “editor in chief” is a positive one and sounds like the right answer because it implies the thing that people care about - strong point of view, meaningful, interesting content. But when you look at the organizational dynamics of the brand what’s more often required is a pragmatic leader capable of a hybrid role            I’ve previously called this the practice of “media design” &#8617;      "

    "content": "I have a friend who’s world class at running workshops. I’ve run a fair number of workshops myself but they’re on another level. If they ever make a film like Jiro Dreams of Sushi but about workshops then my friend is going to play the star role.Their ability to design, orchestrate and execute an effective workshop with a big company where multiple stakeholders are involved is just incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it.The first time I participated in one of their workshops my jaw hit the floor.We’ve had plenty of conversations over the years about helping his agency “do thought leadership” or “start content marketing” or “blogging”. Each time I stress the importance of demonstrating their expertise - their product is so differentiated it’s not even funny!They’ve been blogging and such for a while now and… it’s not bad, but it’s kind of generic. They write articles like “Avoid these three pitfalls with email marketing” or “Black friday holiday tips for ecommerce sites”. The content is fine - and keeps them moving forwards - it shows up on their site, in their emails. There’s good tips!But it’s not thought leadership.I can see that there’s an extreme level of expertise and operational excellence at my friend’s agency, but it’s not well articulated in their marketing and content.This story is, unfortunately, very common. Agencies and consultants who are great at what they do but produce “content marketing” and “thought leadership” that is generic, bland and not very effective.Why is that?Enter Tacit KnowledgeThe answer to this puzzle lies in understanding tacit knowledge. This from Cedric Chin’s just outstanding series on tacit knowledge:Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone.Think about riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle is impossible to teach through descriptions. Sure, you can try to explain what it is you’re doing when you’re cycling, but this isn’t going to be of much help when you’re teaching a kid and they fall into the drain while you’re telling them to “BALANCE! JUST IMAGINE YOU ARE ON A TIGHTROPE AND BALANCE!”.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/The crucial part about tacit knowledge is that it’s extremely hard to teach and pass on to others:How do you teach tacit knowledge? How do you teach bike riding, for that matter?When I was a kid, I taught myself how to ride a bike … by accident. And then I taught my sisters and then my cousin and then another kid in the neighbourhood who was interested but a little scared. They were zooming around in about an hour each. The steps were as follows:Pick a small bike, much smaller than the body of your learner, and therefore not far off the ground. This is useful for the learner because they will be able to put their feet down and save themselves at any moment. It’s also less scary to be not far off the ground.Have them push with their legs and go forward a short distance, again with their feet only inches off the ground. Do this repeatedly, by pushing off, putting both feet down, then stopping and repeating.Make the pushes harder and the distances longer. Eventually, they will spend tens of seconds gliding with their feet held up. The goal here is have them learn how it feels like to balance on a bike.On one of those glides, once they feel ready (and likely a little bored — the point is to get them to do step 3 so many times that they’re feeling secure and eager to move on) — well, once you reach that point, tell them to start peddling.Voilà. You have a bicycling kid.Notice how little verbal instruction is involved. What is more important is emulation, and action — that is, a focus on the embodied feelings necessary to ride a bicycle successfully. And this exercise was quite magical for me, for within the span of an hour I could watch a kid go from conscious incompetence to conscious competence and finally to unconscious competence.In other words, tacit knowledge instruction happens through things like imitation, emulation, and apprenticeship. You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalise the principles behind the actions.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/tacit-knowledge-is-a-real-thing/One of the most fascinating things about tacit knowledge is not only that it’s hard to teach - but once you have tacit knowledge you might not even understand how it works…Again, quoting Cedric’s posts (you really should read the whole series) - he talks about this situation where expert tennis players are able to detect the type of serve within a 100 millisecond window:Now we cut to black before the racket hits the ball. And the experts are still able to say what type of serve that is — they haven’t even seen the racket hit the ball, and they can tell you 85% of the time whether it’s a kick, a flat, or a slice serve. And they can even predict backhand or forehand side on the return. And at that point the novices performance pretty much drops off. Now if we cut it back a little bit further, they’re both down to random (prediction).So now we’ve defined our window of expert advantage. From 50 milliseconds before contact, to 50 milliseconds after contact. There’s a 100 millisecond window in there when the experts have a distinct advantage over the non-experts. So that’s the research finding.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/creating-training-programs/But! The plot thickens - the experts can identify the serve but they can’t explain why:The experts can’t necessarily see what they’re seeing — they almost put it in the ‘ESP category’. [...] And if you press them enough, they’ll start making stuff up. The way that experts do, because they want to give you an answer. So you really need to start ascertaining where that is.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/creating-training-programs/What a phrase - the experts can’t see what they’re seeing.Let’s come back to my friend the master workshopper - the Serena Williams of workshops. In conversations I grew frustrated - “If you could write your 10-part guide to running workshops it would be an incredibly useful piece of content that would get referenced everywhere and by everyone”.But with our understanding of tacit knowledge…. maybe my friend can’t see what he’s seeing? It’s not a failure of effort - he finds it almost impossible to produce this series on running workshops.In reality you struggle with questions like:  What’s the right level of abstraction?  How do I explain the ideas clearly?  Which bits should I include and in what order?And the effort to produce the ultimate guide to workshops stalls and loses momentum.Is all hope lost?Enter ACTA - Applied Cognitive Task AnalysisThe good news is that there’s research and methods on how to extract tacit knowledge from experts. Sneaky eh? The simplest approach is ACTA. From Cedric once again:A Quick Recap of ACTAACTA is a protocol of three interview methods and a presentation format, designed to help a practitioner extract information about the cognitive demands and skills required for a task. The three interview methods are:You first create a task diagram. This is a broad overview of the task in question, and identifies the difficult cognitive elements.You do a knowledge audit — which identifies all the ways in which expertise is used in a domain. You also extract examples based on actual experience.You do a simulation interview — you give the expert a simulation of a single incident, and then probe the expert’s cognitive processes over the course of that simulation.Finally, you present the extracted information in a cognitive demands table.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/john-cutlers-product-expertise/In that post Cedric actually walks through an applied version of ACTA to extract John Cutler’s product expertise. And I think it’s compelling - I think it’s the same process that my friend should go through to build an outline for the “ultimate workshop guide”.It’s not going to solve all of the problems - and it’s not trivial to do - but it provides a framework and process to follow that gets to a reasonable outline of where the expertise lies. In short, how to produce content that focuses on the expert insights and not the generic “how to” advice.How do you start? Small b blogging!This all seems quite cumbersome and heavy handed - going through an ACTA knowledge extraction process sounds like hard work, and doing it from a cold start might not be very effective. Instead if you find yourself trying to get better at thought leadership or content marketing I’d encourage you to go through a process that looks something like this:  Step 1: You first need to start creating content (writing, podcasting, slide decks etc) that allows you to expose your thinking. Thick data - rich in context. Don’t focus on tightly polished and absolute statements and “how-to” but focus on questions, context and musings. What you want is less “5 ways to run a remote workshop” and more “Unanswered questions and thoughts about zoom workshops”. Some inspiration:          small b blogging      a pre-history of weeknotes      lead with some thinking        Step 2: Small group feedback! Once you’re producing this kind of rich context content you should be getting input and feedback from a small group of peers / respected contacts / prospective clients etc. The key idea here is that you don’t need distribution, you just need to listen! Simply email 5-10 people and ask them what they think - have conversations with people about the ideas. This will begin to expose the shape of your tacit knowledge - the things you’re writing about and the way you’re framing your thinking will naturally start to expose where the real insights and expertise lies. This will build confidence that you “have something to say” and might even begin to point out some areas of tacit expertise.  Step 3: Commit to deliberate conversations on the topics you’re writing about. This can be with peers, friends, co-workers etc. Personally I find that podcasts have been great at helping me articulate and talk around subjects - repeatedly touching on key ideas helps you find clear ways of talking about them but also helps you realize which bits are “aha!” moments for your audience.  Step 4: Run an ACTA workshop! Find someone who knows a bit about your field - ideally a peer - and have them run through an ACTA workshop with you - formally extracting, shaping and articulating the tacit knowledge.I think this process would be very effective - both in building a public presence and in building confidence. You can see how if you follow this process you will begin to build an audience (albeit very small!) and you’ll get more confident and articulate at writing and thinking in public - and eventually you’ll reach the output from the ACTA workshops that will give you a clear outline for producing world class content - world class thought leadership that matches your world class expertise."

Angi content that aligns brand / product / audience etc (cost page showing in various pages)Part 4: WorkingAlignment across these aspects:  Brand positioning  Audience insights  Narrative strategy  Distribution  Publishing  ProductThere’s a famous story about art, and quality that goes something like this:Two groups - one makes 100, one makes the very best they can.The group that makes 100 makes better work.Doing strategy often feels like trying to design the very best version of something. But what if we forgot about strategy and just did 100 reps?Maybe before you come to me for a content strategy, you should make 100 pieces of content. Yeah, sure maybe I’d be out of work - but I think a lot of startups in particular would be better off shipping content instead of doing content strategy.–Maybe the artist’s way is the right model here. A deliberate system based around output layering skills up as you go.Let’s make this concrete - what would an engagement look like for a B2B SAAS company?Week 0: Lightweight strategy, to do some quick market sizing, competitive analysisWeek 1: Publish some words. Doesn’t matter much what you publish, but get comfotable with a weekly cadenceWeek 2: Distribute something. Publishing something that goes into an email, social channels etc.Week 3: Publish something longer / differnet / more interestingWeek 4:–Conversely, those clients that come to me and say: “We’ve made 100s of pieces of content, we’ve figured out a lot of what works and what doesn’t. Both from our audience and from our internal workflow. But here are three real challenges we’re facing.” Are much better clients. We have real data, real insights, and we know a bit about our customers and ourselves.So next time you ask for a content strategy - maybe just start writing."

Has some relevant ideas I think.  “It is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor’s job is to be helpful.”I think about this quote often. It’s from the book The Trusted Advisor, which is well worth a read.There’s this fundamental tension as a consultant between being right and being useful. These things are not the same. There’s a question I keep in mind for every consulting project to remind me of this tension: “What is the next most useful thing?”First, though, I want to talk about coming of age in the SEO industry.I spent most of my 20s in the world of SEO. It’s a world full of recommendations. Every agency (and internal team) is making SEO recommendations. It’s a world full of technical fixes and best practices. But it’s also a world full of frustration - clients are frustrated that all they get is a laundry list of best practices. While SEO practitioners are frustratedBeing strategic is simply about doing work in context.It’s about being useful, not right. Let’s explore this tension.Strategy &amp; stewardshipThe work is always in service of the next actionGives you license to push back on clients (they ask for legible work, not useful work)Quotes from trusted advisorSome foundational ideas:1) Clients ask for work in the shape of deliverables because of convention and because of a sense of “control”2) Clients are bad at providing the context for the work3) The most useful thing you can do is often “below your pay grade”4) Your value isIf you like this idea, read the deep dive: The Consultant Out of Time: Chronos &amp; Kairos - a framework for just-in-time consultinghttps://hbr.org/2023/01/how-frank-gehry-delivers-on-time-and-on-budgetTo work on the next most useful thing you need a north star in mind.

Every such system has only a handful of bottlenecks/constraints that prevent the entire system from reaching the global optimum.  Any efforts to optimize the non-constraints are wasted because the throughput of the entire system is controlled by the constraints (aka weakest links). So if you try to optimize your sales but the problem is not enough demand, you’re wasting your time and money.Is the point of innovation to reveal constraints?Can this pair with strategic design?Growth often requires a delicate tradeoff of value. e.g. two sided marketplace"

Places that follow rules. But every library I’ve been in always seems more like a wilderness than you might imagine. A library is a hyperobject - it’s ordered but it’s form can’t fit in your field of view in one go and so you are left to grab hold of ghosts, imagined shadows, to chase down half-remembered ideas and stumble upon secret connections.Anyway. In the year 2025 everyone has a personal library, their own hyperobject in their pocket walking around with them.I have done a dismal job of blogging recently and so I’m building a kind of personal library. Bram Adams has some lovely writing and thinking about the practice of Personal Library Science:Personal Library Science is defined as: the discipline concerned with the organization, retrieval, and transformation of an individual's data.The operative words here are: organization, transformation, and individual. Personal library science is focused on you and your data, not the existence of all data itself. More succinctly, personal library science is focused on your relationship with your information. How do we store information so that it useful at a later date? How do we transform our information into new valuable assets in different creative domains? How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of eight billion distinct individuals? How do we chronicle the information diet of a single person as they learn new things, interact with the world at different phases in their life? How do we make sure we can pass down our best knowledge to generations below? In sum, how do we manage the libraries of us?@_bramses https://www.bramadams.dev/issue-54/After all as Bram says later in Priority list for 2025:  I’m of the strong opinion that personal websites are going to become really important in the continued increase of real world culture from the internet, as well as being able to exist in a language model world. And they’re just really fun.Amen to that.A Library of LinksMy library is rudimentary right now. It’s really two things:  A new linkblog designed for easy sharing of URLs into an archive. I’m heavily using Quotebacks as the foundation of grab a link, grab a quote and publish to my site.  An automatic archive of every single external link on the site. Right now I’m at 1586.https://helloruby.substack.com/p/no-95-small-archives-without-blurs?utm_source=post-banner&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=posts-open-in-app&amp;triedRedirect=true"

    "content": "What is happening right now? Every business is facing disruption in 4 ways:1. Customer Acquisition  Search is radically changing. No one has any idea how either organic or paid search will evolve. B2B companies are already getting more leads from chatGPT than Google. Google has launched AI Mode but there’s no ads. It’s the wild west and anyone who knows what’s coming is lying.  My personal take is that we’re moving from ranking to recommendations. Every link that survives will need a reason to exist.2. Product Expectations  Consumers now expect every search box to be as smart as chatGPT  3. Operations  Your engineers have to learn whole new workflows to work alongside AI agents4. Access to Capital  Access to capital is harder, funding is reserved for “AI companies” now…✨🤖✨What does this all feel like in business? It feel anxious. Like the calm before the storm. While the AI disruption dominates the news cycles it’s not really showing up in the data yet… To paraphrase a headline, disruption is everywhere except the dataI’m reminded of the visualization of anxiety in Inside Out 2 when they have a panic attack:The kinds of tensions this environment creates:  Teams being asked to re-prioritize based on abstract looming threats that don’t yet show up in their data  Companies feeling like they should be doing more with less, while also needing to do lots of new things for the first time  Individuals entirely unsure when it’s ok to use AI silently, or when to disclose “AI helped me with this”. Is using AI an admission or a badge of honor?  Executives needing to both mitigate and leverage AI in their roadmaps while only understanding a surface levelThese tensions are on top of the regular garden variety tensions of tariffs, looming recessions and so on…✨🤖✨Clearly"

    "content": "What apartment number do I live in?Its an innocent enough question that I would have been able to answer 1.57 seconds ago. Now - my heart is racing and my mind is working faster and slower than it has ever done and I’m trying to figure out if it’s apartment 2A or 2C that I live in.You see - 1.57 seconds ago my access to the net went dark. Offline. Out. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Since birth I’ve had access to the net subcutaneously - implants under the skin just under my scalp able to communicate directly with my brain. Two arrays of gigahertz processors with microtech Bluetooth.At least that’s what I’d have told you 1.57 seconds ago. Now I’m barely keeping my shit together trying to figure out if I can remember which apartment I live in.–I round the corner of Kayes Street and I’ve taken to muttering to myself - the silence in my own brain is a thunderous cacophony and unbearable. Muttering under my breath helps a little. Distracted by my own mumbling, my legs don’t have to question which apartment I live in - they guide me to 2A comfortably and my hands go into auto-pilot, placing the keys in the lock and opening the door. I’m glad at least part of my body has it’s shit together because my brain is an unreliable useless mess right now.–It’s two hours later and I’ve dug up an old iphone - back before the microtech networks were two-way and instantaneous like how we used to use iphones to communicate. Now it seems laughably archaic but holding this slim piece of metal and glass in my hand I’m able to marvel at how slick a device this is and right now it’s a life saver. I rummage for a plug and put it on to charge. While it’s charging I look around my apartment and it’s like my brain is swimming through molasses. All of my memories, thoughts, ideas are like they’re half a second too slow. With access to the net everything happens instantly (or so it feels) - but now it’s like there are little men inside my head who have to go and retrieve files stored in cabinets and some cabinets are further away than others.–I’m back online. The glowing screen of the iphone gazes unflinchingly at me. I’d forgotten what this was like. I fire up blinkchat and am overwhelmed by the constant stream of updates and chatter - everyone is asking where I am, what happened to me and if I’m ok. As soon as I read an update, 6 more pop up on the screen. My stupid regular brain just can’t keep up - everyone else is sending these messages directly from their brains via microtech and all I have are these wet stumps of flesh called hands with which to type (type!) a reply out on.  Am ok. Net went offline. Am home. All ok.This doesn’t seem to appease the beast and my iphone crashes as continuous updates and notifications overwhelm the poor device. Jeez - is that what used to happen inside my brain? No wonder life feels so slow all of a sudden.–I write my apartment number on my hand, just in case, and head out for lunch. My favorite vietnamese place is just around the corner. I walk into the cafe and head up to the counter - somewhere in the back of my brain I’m marveling at the number of things that are happening simultaneously in my body, walking, thinking, looking. See, this old lump of flesh and bones isn’t so useless after all! I’m starting to kind of enjoy this disconnection when the realization hits me like a ton of bricks. I look around the cafe in a panic. All around there are people - people that look like me, eating, drinking talking and being NORMAL. But I’m stuck. I spin around - remembering that a few years ago they got rid of the people working here - everything runs via the net. As I spin around looking around and feeling cut off a roomba spins past me carrying someones food.It’s ok, I’ve got this. I walk up to a couple in their late-20s. They’re eating pho. My favorite dish (I think?).  Hi, excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt but my access to the net is down. Would you mind ordering me some food?As soon as the words are out of my mouth I realize what this looks like. I’m in a restaurant harassing customers, appearing like a madman, telling weird tales of being cut off from the net. The couple exchanges a glance - barely registering eye contact - and in that split second I realize that they have likely exchanged an entire conversation between them over blinkchat. My brain feels like a bike compared to their Formula 1 race cars. I feel my cheeks blush and I stammer something about being sorry to interrupt and rush out of the restaurant.–Hands deep in my jacket pockets I brace myself to the cold outside and walk fast down the street. I’m trying to make my brain go faster, better, to THINK dammit. What’s wrong with me? I can’t seem to focus at all - the dopamine loops in my brain have been optimized for so long to respond to instant, all knowing, information that I’m basically a nervous wreck without it. I imagine a mess of wires inside my brain all plugged into the wrong slots - connections firing without purpose, data flowing but me being unable to process the output. I imagine those poor guys pulling information out of filing cabinets in my brain. Sound the alarm! Red alert! We’re back in action fellas!–I’m still stung by the experience in the restaurant - the look in their eyes as they looked at me, through me - a horrific sub-human being incapable of ordering via the in-restaurant mesh. What happened to paper menus and human waiters eh? What was so wrong about all that?"

    "content": "I worked as a visual librarian when I was a young man living in Paris. A custodian of all the images, photographs, paintings and media humanity had produced.My job paid pennies and the collection was poorly organized but I enjoyed spending my days unearthing and exploring the image library. Removed from the fast paced urban living this collection of images - most designed to excite and stimulate - were calm and serene. In between boxes of photos I would stumble on advertising slogans and catalogs of rejected logos. Life size prints of magazine covers. Dust motes in the air somehow the disjointed hyper-stimulating collection calmed me.But frustration walked in the door one day in the form of the professor. I never learned his name but I did learn to despise him. Trained in architecture and working at an advertising and communications agency (while painting at night I came to understand) the professor exclaimed that he had seen every kind of image. No new images or visual media were left in his life. And he blamed me for being unable to find him new images.His imagination he claimed was exhausted. There was no more progress possible. And it was my job to satisfy him. To present him with some image or style or visual that he had never seen before.At first, as custodian and, humbly, expert of the visual archives I thought it a fun challenge to find something new.Gaudi. Pointilism. Chinese architecture. A catalog of colors. Pinhole photography.Everytime I brought the professor something he would take it in silence only to return the next week and proclaim that he had seen it before. Or that it was nothing more than a simple recombining of other derivitive forms.A book of germs was my greatest mistake. A rare 1929 thick leather bound book filled with plates painstakingly photographed through a simple microscope I thought the images arresting and fresh and somehow more urgent and important than anything else I’d give him.But when he returned with the book the look on his face was thunderous and he proceeded to lecture me until the sun went down and I missed my train home on the essence of originality and how biology and life was the most banal and reducible forms of image. Everything was biology! He exclaimed. These germs are the very mother of all images! I see them in literally every single visual scene I can imagine!And he proceeded to tear down stacks of books and empty drawers of posters as he pointed and demonstrated what was to him the same image again and again and again.My mind has not seen a new image in 20 years! Everything is but a shadow of what I have already seen! There are no new mediums and no new images! I fear we have reached the end of the visual medium!And clutching his head he rushed from the library leaving me with nothing more or less than settling dust, a single dim light overhead, scattered books and images and the crushing emptiness left behind by the weight of the end of image.Already late at night and with much tidying to be done (and anyhow as mentioned I had missed my train) I resolved to spend the night in the library. I would find an original image. I would search and strain until no image had been left un-looked at.Slowly the library returned to order. I swept and cleaned and tidied as I went but slowly and methodically as I went row by row browsing and considering all materials. I vowed to find the orignal-image-needle in the library-haystack.Eventually. With a tidy library and a fresh stack of items pulled and assembled from the archives I saw the sun peeking up out of the windows and I went home. Over tired and exhausted but quietly confident I had found original image. Surely they were obscure and to my eyes (young though I was) shared no lineage with images before or after.All through that week the stack haunted me. I knew it was a promising collection:A book on pirate flags from 1830 - written and illustrated by a real seafaring pirate.The complete archives of a small accounting firm which included diagrams and doodles in the margins of the paperwork quite unlike anything I had ever seen.A set of photographs that were untagged and unlabelled found nestled in between old magazines. I could not make out the subject or even how they had been taken but they possessed some quality that deeply unsettled me.And finally, fresh the day before, the full rejected suite of marketing materials for a brand of men’s suits that folded before the marketing materials could be unveiled. Created by a young advertising student at a local University the marketing was at once bad and original. Too literal and boring while containing some desirable insight that made me want to question every fashion decision I had ever made.The week passed like agony. Time dragging and my stack of materials taunting me with their immovability. Until eventually the professor returned.He swept in Saturday afternoon. It must have been raining outside because his rain jacket was dripping and he had the air of someone who’s head has been ducked down to avoid the wind and rain.Without stopping to take off his jacket or remove his hat the professor strode confidently into the library and with a small nervous nod from me picked up the stack I had prepared.Perhaps it was the tension in the air. Perhaps it was the rain outside and the professor did not want to leave. Perhaps it was simply the urgency he felt but the professor stopped at one of the tables by the door. My curated images in his hands, the rain dripping from his coat sleeves still he flipped quickly but methodically through the images. Making sure he saw every one.I looked at him without breathing. Waiting with tension for his verdict.Once he had finished the professor slumped back in the chair. A raindrop fell from his hat onto his cheek and rolled mournfully down his face as if the heavens were crying through him.Enough. He said. Almost too quietly for me to hear. And then again. Louder.Enough!ENOUGH! How is it that there are no new images left! How is it that I am able to understand and anticipate and deconstruct every single thing you show me? Nothing here is more interesting than a row of grey bricks on an unremarkable house in a grey city of shallow visual boring nothingness!!He was shouting now. And standing. Arms raised above him clearly aiming his frustration and anger at me but broadcasting at the same time to the gods in case they happened to be watching or listening too.You might think this powerful man with some heroic ability to understand all imagery would have cowed me but something in me snapped. I had been dancing around this library for months attempting to please him and I had worked hard to discover original and obscure works but nothing had been good enough for him.Taking the professors anger as my own I jumped to my feet shouting words that are now lost in history. Like a madman I was screaming. Whatever it was I said it clearly took him by surprise because he staggered back, taking the rain hat from his head with eyebrows raised.But something had changed in me. I stormed to the nearest pile and started ripping and tearing up pages, taking posters and making confetti, turning books into crumpled balls of paper. Scientific papers filled with diagrams from hundreds of years before fell in tatters at my feet.None of this sated my rage though and with temperature rising I continued to destroy and remove images from where they had been filed and bound and organized. I grabbed a pen - whatever had been at the front desk and I scrawled on the back of a shred of poster I had just destroyed:Original never before seen images.And then in a bundle under this “cover” page I shoved scraps of books, photograpsh, canvas, art, science, words, diagrams and every other thing.As I assembled them I kept scribbling and writing putting words on and across and over the images. “Original”, “new”, “image” or on a photograph I would write “boring” and on a painting I recognized as a piece of cubist art on canvas I wrote “lines never seen”.Eventually my whirlwind energy began to die and I felt physical exhaustion setting in. I took two large binding clips and bound my “book” together and thrust it into the professors hands.There! I proclaimed. Original images!And it was my turn to collapse into the nearest chair. Full and utter bone bending tiredness overtook me completely.The silence hung in the air and eventually I looked up at the professor.With a thin firm smile spreading across his face my eyes met his and we knew. Somehow. I had done it."

    "content": "Descending into Iceland from orbit is breathtaking if you do it right. Often you can see the northern lights, the glaciers and the glass spires of Reykjavik all contributing to a stunning vista. On my most recent trip however an absence of solar flares and cloud cover meant that I sank into a dull grey fog as the cruiser landed in Reykjavik, as if the city hid some troubled thoughts. I certainly did.I've been visiting Iceland for the past 12 months regularly to interview, in person, Layola - the first human being with DNA successfully manipulated via CRISPr technology. In 2018 Layola received advanced recombinant DNA configuration across her whole genome using CRISPr - essentially using natural machines made of proteins and RNA to artificially switch some of her genes on and off. The purpose of the procedure was to cure her severe autism and the procedure took 12 months of intensive treatment.Layola was the first human to receive a CRISPr procedure and the only human to receive the procedure since.There is no question that her autism was cured, and Layola will tell you she is happy with the outcome, but to call the treatment a success requires understanding the full effects of the treatment spanning Layola's behaviour, her pre-frontal cortex, the inner workings of international medical advisory board (IMAB) and 50 years of quarantine in Iceland in a glass box and with limited contact with the outside world.--In the period 2000 - 2018 Autism was a common diagnosis. Poorly understood, we lumped the condition with ADHD and tried to pinpoint the cause on vaccines, gluten sensitivity in diet, pre-birth oxygen flow, ambient 5G radiation and many more besides.--Layola was born in 2000 in southern New Jersey in a region called south shore - now completely submerged - to two parents, Marshal and Alice. Loving parents, a middle class family and a child with autism. First diagnosed at 4 because of early learning difficulties and later confirmed aged 7 because of extreme sensitivity to touch, a lack of all spoken language and avoidance of eye contact.Aged 14 Layola was sent to a privately funded retreat - where she was supervised 24/7 by carers and given a secure compound to explore, play in and call home. What was going on inside Layola's mind at the time was largely misunderstood at the time but her externalities were extreme. Severe self harm, extreme aversion to human contact, complete and utter dependency on specific sensory inputs such as sounds and colors.In 2018, 50 years ago this week, Layola was selected and approved for CRISPr gene recombinant therapy.--\"I suppose, you could start with the words. That was the first thing I remember coming out of the autism. I had been processing sounds my whole life but never in any organized fashion - but to hear words and speaking as you and I are now - that was something entirely alien and foreign\"Layola speaks with a quiet confidence, at once soothing and calculated. Each word carries a pause behind it as if each word is selected based on it's own merit, no word more or less important than the last.--The facility where Layola lives is difficult to describe favorably - a modest secure building in downtown Reykjavik, once the cutting edge of design, connected grid-living and security but long surpassed by the technology companies now crowding the downtown skyline and subway advertising.Still, every year the IMAB and the CIA renew their contract to secure the building 24/7 with an armed staff and every 5 years a carbon/neutron probing appraisal is made of the 20-foot thick concrete walls surrounding the building. Further security details, habits, quirks and insights that I've picked up visiting Layola's home over the past year are omitted from this article at the request of the CIA.--When I asked if she was happy in her home, there was a pause followed by the measured response of \"I suppose I've never known more or less but all my needs are met and I remain content.\""

    "content": "Gormen is my horizon and my home. This towering city of red rust stuck on the side of a dead asteroid. This crumbling outpost a legacy of a crumbling empire.I am seven when the Computer chooses me as the next Controller of Gormen. Aghast, I rebel in the only way a seven year old can. I run away. Through the corridors and hangers of this decaying city of red rust, I flee. Pursued by a great horror that I can't name but I can feel - I flee through the great hall where the daily meal is being conducted - hundreds of people dancing in a mad orchestra of routine and tasks to feed the workers - I flee still.Through the lower levels the people of Gormen are covered in red dust, the red rust of this place literally killing them from the outside in.You never truly escape the red dust but as you climb through the the levels of Gormen somehow the air becomes thinner, purer, less dust.I run.I flee through the sleeping chambers, where the bodies of dormant workers appear like hulking beasts. To me, they appeared non-human, grotesque perhaps. Vile. Noises and smells that my seven year old body, as yet, doesn't understand. I flee past the air vents - constructions so big that I have to crane my neck to comprehend them. Their thundering noise is somehow calming to me - reassuring that this city is still breathing, still alive, still doing what it should. The mechanics of this community are alien to me - workers and machines and servants and the high court and the mess halls and the engineers and the scientists and cooks and... I don't understand. I can't understand - just like Gormen the meaning of this place is layered up - layers of people, metal, rust and routine.I run.As I ascend Gormen to the higher levels, the noise retreats and is replaced with the glow of lighting that is too bright. Too false. The people are no longer covered in red rust but their eyes reflect the false light. They are empty and lifeless - motions devoid of the quickness and primal qualities of the workers of the lower levels. And yet here there is less rust. Less dust in everyone's hair, in everyone's clothes.The library. A place I've been many times for education but never on my own. I see the librarian coming towards me and truly see with my eyes the monstrosity of a creature half man, half machine. Oil sheens on his metal surfaces while his human eyes burn with a look of knowledge that appears demonic. A creature who has traded form for knowledge - to give up his humanity to become all-knowing. All knowing and ponderous. I can easily outpace him and this, finally, gives me my first taste of freedom. These upper levels are steeped so thickly in tradition and etiquette that it is as if the whirling system of people and things move only in regimented movements, a limited finite way of being - destined to repeat infinitely again and again their movements and conversations.Still I run.I lose my way more times than I can count - dead end passages, locked doors, great halls that are colder than death itself. I stumble into a room filled with dancing lights, flickering and beautiful but when I see the faces of the trapped people - wired from every part of their body and a state of rapture on their faces, drooling and muttering and smiling and laughing an empty sickly laugh, I turn and flee. Those faces haunt me as I stumble on - still running and still scared but now I have been running for so long that I am feeling free - the solid pounding of my feet on the metal floors of Gormen reassuring me that this is physical and real.What characters will there be in this story? The spiders of Gormen - the computers’ eyes and ears forever creeping on, and over everything. The rust, of course. Spick who will become my best friend from the miners - his infectious laugh and real human energy in his eyes but lacking the understanding of education. Mervyn - my assistant and mentor forever faithful but forever lacking, bound to the rituals and mechanics of the system. And Braun - the first voice in the senate and the puppet master of the upper levels. But there is plenty of time for that.Still I run.Down a long, narrow corridor I emerge into the observation deck. A hundred windows blazing with the radiance of the carpet of stars in the night sky. It will take me years to find this place again, and the next time I see it somehow it won't be as beautiful as this time. Seven years old and heir to the whole of Gormen, I am able to put aside the looming dread and gaze out across the surface of the moon. Is the towering construction of metal and people Gormen or is the moon Gormen? Where does one truly end and one truly begin? I can look out over the valleys and mountains of the moon - everywhere tinged the same red color - and look up at the stars. Like pinpricks in the curtain of night, they hang motionless and yet twinkling. I am tired and lie down to rest. Rest perched on the very edge of Gormen - as far from the belly of the beast as I can manage. Many miles overhead the machines we call crows wheel and toss in some imaginary wind buffeted by space and tracing some pattern known only to the Computer. I feel for the crows out there in space with no air and no heat. How can those machines not lose their minds? Already my brain is confusing humans and machines - already my perception of things is losing it's grip.I will look back many years later, once I have become the Controller truly and know every chamber, every air vent and every crack in this majestic ruined place - once I understand how the rituals work and how the machine functions - the system made of humans and metal, of brains and computers. I will look back and wonder what did I know of Gormen as a seven year old? Gazing out from that observation deck - what did I know of the true nature of Gormen? This spiraling city of red rust. Perhaps, I will think, I knew it better at that age than I ever did again."

He worked day and night at the quantum observatory research lab attached to the New Frontier science outpost orbiting Aries12.Our understanding of time and space have changed in the last 100 years, what begun with relativity, was extended through quantum mechanics and then later entangled-thermodynamics upended our notions and our understanding but ultimately very little changed in our day to day. Yes we were able to master short wormhole transportation but only in isolated channels through our solar system, at short distances from the energy harvester orbiting the sun.Using this we catapulted a short number of expeditions to some of the nearest stars and inhabitable planets around Earth.It was on one of these space hops that Jonah and Franny fell in love. 30 years ago. Both quantum scientists they spent their entire education learning how to entangle molecules, only to end up entangling each other in the emotions of love.But Jonah was destined for Aries12, and Franny for Aries13. And with a limited distance using the hops from our home solar system Jonah and Franny are separated for the rest of their lives. Without even any means to communicate other than radio waves with a 20-year lag. And, of course, the entangled beacons.12 in total, designed to withstand the ravages of space, stabalised in 5 dimensions using a combination of magnetic and gravitonic fields. These entangled beacons are linked outside of space/time. Across space/time. Using space/time. Really, it's impossible with our understanding still to determine HOW entanglement works. But work it does. Instantly. So Aries13, 20 light years from Aries12, itself 10 light years from Earth. Each with a series of entangled beacons capable of communicating 12 bits of information in total. 1 or 0. But able to communicate instantly.The game theorists on earth had calculated a complicated matrix of scenarios, and an associated chart of communication patters guiding the use and interpretation of these quantum beacons. So far two beacons had been used. One signaling that Aries13 was indeed habitable, that all was safe and that resources were abundant and one signaling that resources had stabalised and colonization had begun.But of course you can't leave two amorous quantum scientists together for 10 years on a lonely voyage through space without expecting them to entangle themselves. Both literally and metaphorically. You see in addition to the 12 \"official\" quantum beacons Jonah and Franny had created 5 entangled particles, held in simple crude quartz chambers "

After all, there is a good chance the gig economy will outgrow the paycheck economy, relegating the latter to a minority sector of the economy overall. Imagining our future in relation to the future of paycheck work would be like early industrial age workers imagining their future in terms of the future of farming. Much of the supposed “future of work” thinking I see around the gig economy strikes me as the equivalent of early factory workers worrying about where to park their cows.>>So the gig economy needs to outgrow its origin story in the paycheck world. For the gig economy to grow from limited sideshow to full-blown folkway, we need to talk about a lot more, and develop much deeper internal realities and subjectivities.source: [Towards Gigwork as a Folkway](https://artofgig.substack.com/p/towards-gigwork-as-a-folkway)-->I think the question of whether or not to outsource curatorial practice is a good opening to discuss the broader practice of outsourcing in general in the cultural heritage sector. It certainly easier for more people to relate to than the question of whether or not we should outsource digital and technology roles. This is a larger debate that we, as a community of practice, should have because I think that one risk of relentless outsourcing is that museums (and friends) will become nothing more than centers of production rather than scholarship.>>If we say that our only purpose is to facilitate the assembly of content in the service of culture then it's no longer clear to me what distinguishes the cultural heritage sector from any other for-profit entertainment company. If we are unable to articulate, even to ourselves, what distinguishes our work from that produced by the private sector then maybe it really is time to admit there's nothing special about what we do. And importantly there are other people who do it — where it is pure and selfish entertainment — better than we do.source: [[this is aaronland] it's like trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich in a toaster](https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2019/11/25/toaster/)"

Each chapter has a section below, each with additional resources - youtube videos, podcasts, blog posts and articles - and each section ends with a quiz. The quizzes are there to help you make sure that you’ve locked the information in.

I wondered what would happen if we could combine the magic and power of video games, with the rigour and reporting of journalism? What if we could make a really good news game?source: https://robinkwong.com/storytelling/–  Collective Wisdom is a first-of-its-kind field study of the media industry, that maps works that live outside the limits of singular authorship. While the concept of co-creation is entering the zeitgeist, it is an ancient and under-reported dynamic. Media co-creation has particular relevance in the face of today’s myriad of challenges, such as the climate crisis and threats to democracy. But it is not without risks and complications. In this study we look at how people co-create within communities; across disciplines; and increasingly, with living systems and artificial intelligence (AI). We also synthesize the risks, as well as the practical lessons from the field on how to co-create with an ethos grounded in principles of equity and justice. This qualitative study reframes how culture is produced, and is a first step in articulating contemporary co-creative practices and ethics. In doing so, it connects unusual dots.source: Collective Wisdom · Works in Progress–  But what about their information architecture? Almost all of them are built in a feed structure, while the information architecture of the Internet is almost completely hidden behind the scene. There is no ‘Facebook homepage’ that presents updates, requiring you to click on the update, go to the update page, and then click back to return to the homepage.source: News media should rethink their website architecture–  “Rappers got their start by releasing rawer, uncut mixtapes to the streets. These tapes were more frequent, less polished, and had samples we knew damn well weren’t cleared! But once the artist got popular, their studio albums were more polished, had radio-friendly singles, big-name producers, and a slow song or two to broaden appeal.  When artists focus on albums and stop making mixtapes (or mixtape-type music), they risk losing the audience that fueled their rise. But if artists stuck only with mixtapes, there’s a higher chance they might never breakout. Doing both allows them to grow while staying true to their roots. That’s why Lil’ Wayne’s run from 2005-2009 was so iconic. He released classic mixtapes and albums to maintain both audiences.”source: How Tyler Perry Built a Customer-Centric Empire - Trapital by Dan Runcie"

They could master the skill of traversing multiple streams of information flowing through our increasingly digital lives. And they could teach that skill to patrons, unleashing a wave of creativity and empowerment in the communities they serve.source: Libraries in the Digital Age: A Case Study in Equipping Librarians with the Tools of Idea Management–  We need to develop — both among library patrons and librarians themselves — new critical capacities to understand the distributed physical, technical and social architectures that scaffold our institutions of knowledge and program our values. And we must consider where those infrastructures intersect — where they should be, and perhaps aren’t, mutually reinforcing one another. When do our social obligations compromise our intellectual aspirations, or vice versa? And when do those social or intellectual aspirations for the library exceed — or fail to fully exploit — the capacities of our architectural and technological infrastructures? Ultimately, we need to ensure that we have a strong epistemological framework — a narrative that explains how the library promotes learning and stewards knowledge — so that everything hangs together, so there’s some institutional coherence. We need to sync the library’s intersecting infrastructures so that they work together to support our shared intellectual and ethical goals.source: Library as Infrastructure"

We think at first of drawings and diagrams, but there are other forms of sketching. The OED offers several pertinent uses of the term, none of them earlier than the late 17th century. The first refers to the visual arts: “A rough drawing or delineation of something, giving the outlines or prominent features without the detail, esp. one intended to serve as the basis of a more finished picture, or to be used in its composition; a rough draught or design. Also, in later use, a drawing or painting of a slight or unpretentious nature.” The second extends it to literary creations: “A brief account, description, or narrative giving the main or important facts, incidents, etc., and not going into the details; a short or superficial essay or study, freq[uently] in pl[ural] as a title.” A third, rare usage, makes a sketch simply “[t]he general plan or outline, the main features, of anything”. One can find all three sorts of sketches at work in the formation of the new science of the seventeenth century.Source: Sketching Science in the 17th Centuryhttp://www.xplaner.com/visual-thinking-school/https://twitter.com/nicolasnova/status/1376581318637670400https://davidhoang.substack.com/p/sketching-as-a-strategy?ref=uxdesignweeklyhttps://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/https://syllabusproject.org/diagrams/https://www.oarplatform.com/response/cartography-research-process-visual-essay/https://syllabusproject.org/diagrams/https://www.are.na/sim-polism/psychoanalysis-diagrams"

As important as this emphasis may be, we mould argue that it is seriously limited, that the process needs to be viewed from a wider perspective so that the variety of ways in which strategies actually take shape can be considered. For over 10 years now, we have been researching the process of strategy formation based on the definition of strategy as 'a pattern in a stream of decisions' [Small groups and consultancy](http://interconnected.org/home/2015/10/07/small_groups_and_consultancy) - by the ever brilliant Matt Webb:> I don't think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company's nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it's not thinking straight, that the organisation isn't put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.[The art of sharing](https://www.epicpeople.org/the-art-of-sharing/) - Jan Chipchase is a master at this and I can't wait to read the full handbook but this excerpt is especially relevant for the sharing / campaign thinking I mention above.[Consultancy, Creativity and Cooking with Sunday Dinner](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/consultancy-creativity-cooking-sunday-dinner-lindsey-slaby) - from the great Lindsey Slaby thinking about new ways of getting creative projects staffed, funded, connected and thought about.

I.e. a new type of work or one that the org does infrequently so has no way to efficiently monitor the quality of work.This maps well to my idea of ways of seeing - i.e. teaching clients how to see the work is another way of saying teaching clients how to monitor the work. Dashboards rule everything around me.Clients have problems that they describe as \"I don't know how to build this\" when what they mean is \"I don't know how to measure this\".-->Yet beyond being (cognitive) labour saving devices models have another obvious virtue. They provide a shared intellectual scaffolding: a common ground upon which people can interact and engage. In that sense models have communicative virtuosity - they are good to talk with.

In that discourse, “productivity isolates and sanctifies the actions of individuals. It elevates an elite class of worker beyond the concerns of mundane others.” Productivity fetishism suits a society of free agents who must continually renegotiate the terms of their value, their viability, their irreplaceable contributions; it not only provides a rationale for employers to sort contract workers, but it provides those workers a way to frame their achievement in the absence of a stable association to a particular job or a particular set of co-workers. More and more of us are perpetually in the position of a baseball player facing an arbitration hearing. We cast everyone else as the replacement-level people that we are besting with our superior performances. To garner proof of that, we’re more likely to tolerate increasingly invasive forms of surveillance that can document our accomplishments and chart our personal growth on whatever metric is necessary, whichever seems to give us leverage over the competition, if not the employers.source: [Not Relevant for Fantasy Purposes — Real Life](https://reallifemag.com/dispatches/not-relevant-for-fantasy-purposes)--[High performing teams](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CwT4q7bSQSIn8BPm7Xcoiy1Q8funZD8PwH-E2ShmCzo/edit#slide=id.g5267a7edd3_2_12)--[What theorizing is not, theorizing is](http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Doctoral_Resources/Weick_What_theory_is_not_theorizing_is.pdf) - (pdf)-->Learning results from the adaptive and manipulative interactions between an organization and its environments: experimental actions are important because organizations rarely master their environments so that they can develop lasting optimal responses... Long-term survival calls for surveillance of opportunities, whereas short-term coping concentrates upon problematic search. Most organizations have much of the latter and little of the former (Thompson, 1967). Yet, if organizations are to survive in hostile and changing environments, they must change strategies and pursue new development patterns. Organizational design should encourage experimenting so that organizations attain long-term viability.source: [How Organizations Learn and Unlearn (Hedberg, 1981)](http://johnljerz.com/superduper/tlxdownloadsiteWEBSITEII/id167.html)--[Contextual Wireframe Presentation by 𝐌𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐦 𝐋𝐞𝐲𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐨𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐡 on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6179363-Contextual-Wireframe-Presentation)-->A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that “simply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn’t necessarily improve their decision-making,” with respondents indicating “that they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren’t rewarded when they did.” No wonder Deloitte’s Reimagining Measurement initiative, which asked more than 125 social sector leaders what changes they most hoped to see in the next decade, identified “more effectively putting decision-making at the center” as the sector’s top priority.source: [Why Your Hard Work Sits on the Shelf — and What to Do About It](https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/this-is-why-your-hard-work-sits-on-the-shelf-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it-a7ca5e063038)-->I think we have trouble justifying architectural investments in software engineering because, unlike in the automotive factory, our systems machinery is hidden away in a data center or “in the cloud.” However, if we demonstrate rigor and get creative about exposing the machinery to the CEO, the justification may become a lot easier.source: [Expose the Machinery — Resilien](https://www.resilien.tech/blog/2019/9/10/expose-the-machinery)--Indy Johar - The boring revolution Systems thinking, complex systems.-->You came in as the high end consultant on rarefied air.  But then you stick around, and the luster wears off.  You eat cheeseburgers for lunch, just like everyone else.  And, after a bunch of months, you don’t seem as special as you used to.  Just one of the crew.source: [The Siren Song of the Long Term Engagement - DaedTech](https://daedtech.com/siren-song-long-term-engagement/)This is wrong!

Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it. Because of this, information scientists suggest other methods: search, more flexible than navigating folders; tags, which allow multiple categorizations; and group information management.

Note taking is not the under-studied force of knowledge, play is.source: [Deliberate Practice for Knowledge Work | simon sarris](https://simonsarris.com/play)"

    "content": "So much of consulting is not “having the answer” but helping everyone get to the answer together. It’s about exploration and process as much as it’s about expertise and “being right”.To that end - I’m fascinated by this idea of “small groups consultancy” from Matt Webb:  There are a couple of things I’m investigating:  1) That a small group is a powerful way of thinking, and of creating action. That repetition matters, and informality.  2) It might be possible to help with strategy without providing original thought or even active facilitation: To consult without consulting. The answers and even ways of working are inherent in the group itself.  My hunch is this: To answer a business’s strategic questions, which will intrinsically involve changing that business, a more permanent solution than a visiting consultant might be to convene a small group, and spend time with it, chatting informally.You’ve really got to read the whole post here: Small groups and consultancy and coffee mornings.Open questions:  What kind of problems need this “small groups” approach?  How do the commercials work? Who gets paid what? Who has incentive to make this work?  What other models exist outside of traditional consulting?"
