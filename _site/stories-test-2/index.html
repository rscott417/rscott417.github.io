        <h1 class="f3 lh-title">Taking Blogging Seriously</h1>
        <h2 class="f4 i">Finally understanding why blogging is so important to me</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>It’s a warm summer night in NYC and I’m walking through central park with a friend, the fireflies blink around us like an external reflection of the neurons firing in our brains as the conversation sparks.</p>

<p>We talk about meditation, our life’s goals and wants. And blogging, of course.</p>

<p>I’ve always been an advocate for blogging. It’s rare for a conversation with my friends to not at some point touch on blogging. It’s a running joke at this point.</p>

<p>But it’s no joke. You should take blogging seriously. I am.</p>

<p>After some soul searching it’s clear to me, finally, <em>why</em> blogging is so important to me. It’s not because of the internet, or even because of writing. It’s because it’s a vehicle for creative expression.</p>

<p>There’s something deeper here - too much of adulting is designed to stamp out individual creative expression. And when we do finally carve out the time for some creative projects the world encourages us to keep it to ourselves. To journal in our bedroom, to paint in our basement, to hide away from others. Who taught us that creative joy should be a secret?</p>

<p>I call BS.</p>

<p>Blogging is deeply important to me because it’s a powerful mixture of two ideas: creative expression and finding the others.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1fc0fea2-e987-4199-b627-f2a6a592dd22.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>It’s about helping you become more of who you specifically want to be, so that you can find deep and meaningful connections with others.</p>

<p>As Henrik beautifully put it, <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query">A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people</a>:</p>

You ask yourself: What would have made me jump off my chair if I had read it six months ago (or a week ago, or however fast you write)? If you have figured out something that made you ecstatic, this is what you should write. And you do not dumb it down, because you were not stupid six months ago, you just knew less. You also write with as much useful detail and beauty as you can muster, because that is what you would have wanted.

<p>Realizing why blogging is important to me personally I realize why it pains me to see Erin making art and not sharing it on Instagram. I realize why I love <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/">riffs</a> and small b blogging. I realize why we started <a href="https://www.fiercelycurious.com/">an artist collective</a> to get artists more visibility. I realize why I love <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/erinprz/journey-to-the-end-of-the-night-a-childrens-book">self publishing</a> so much. I realize why I <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/">wrote my book in public</a> as I went along.</p>

<p>Creative expression that finds the others.</p>

<h2 id="blogging-isnt-writing-its-a-way-of-seeing-the-world-with-fresh-eyes">Blogging isn’t writing, it’s a way of seeing the world with fresh eyes</h2>

<p>Of course blogging isn’t just writing. It’s a way of seeing the world with fresh eyes. Blogging is a mindset.</p>

<p>You should write because when you know that you’re <em>going</em> to write, it changes the way you live. I’m thinking about a book I read called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Field-Science-Nature-Michael-Canfield/dp/0674057570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature</a></em>, a collection of essays by scientists about their notes. It’s hard to imagine a more tedious concept — a book of essays about <em>notes</em>? — but in execution it was wonderful. What it teaches you, over and over again, is that the difference between you and a zoologist or you and a botanist is that the botanist, when she looks at a flower, has a question in mind. She’s trying to <em>generate</em> questions. For her the flower is the locus of many mental threads, some nascent, some spanning her career. Her field notebook is not some convenient way to store lifeless data to be presented in lifeless papers so that other scientists can replicate some dull experiment; it’s the site of a collision between a mind and a world.</p>

        <h1 class="f3 lh-title">Google is Grounded and Needs to Learn How to Soar</h1>
        <h2 class="f4 i">A short proposal for the future of search</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users <em>and</em> in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.</p>

<p>For decades, Google’s advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.</p>

<p>First with AI Overviews, then most recently with AI Mode - both experiments from Google seem short-sighted as experiences:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ai-overviews-ai-mode.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not a link in sight, search has turned into a dead-end.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<h2 id="google-is-grounded">Google is Grounded</h2>

<p>“Grounding” an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. You’d think grounding means: “Find the best sources, then write the answer.” But with LLMs, it’s often: “Write the answer, then find sources that sort of back it up.” It’s like writing a school essay and adding the citations after.</p>

<p>Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding, the answer is used to inform the search results.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly (and I’ll be the first to admit I’m no expert here) the grounding process essentially augments the LLM with key info from web pages to ensure that each of the claims and statements in the response is correct and true. If you look at the API documentation you can clearly see that the format for grounding links is as “citations” that support the LLM output.</p>

<p>For a technical overview of the grounding process <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview">see this post</a>, or for a more specific look at how Gemini grounds in search <a href="https://dejan.ai/blog/hacking-gemini/">see this post</a>.</p>

<p>The grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it’s an effective part of the response.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.</p>

<p>It seems fairly likely to me that the grounding process is what’s powering the links included in both AI Overviews and AI Mode. They barely link out at all and when they do the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ai-citations.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes - often providing dead-end answers. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.</p>

<p>It’s not that grounding is wrong - it’s a valuable part of the process to generate accurate responses. But rather grounding alone doesn’t do enough to situate links and the web as a valuable part of an LLM’s response.</p>

<p>I think Google can do better.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-way">A Better Way</h2>

<p>Needless to say, lots of people are concerned about an information ecosystem that destroys the vibrancy, diversity and depth of the open web. I believe there’s a better way - and while playing around <strong>I found that simply writing a better system prompt inside Gemini gave me radically better results than the current AI Mode response</strong>.</p>

<p>The full system prompt is below but first let’s look at some example outputs. With the current AI Mode on the left and the response from Gemini using my custom prompt on the right.</p>

<p>Tomato soup recipe:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tomato-soup-recipe.png" alt="" /></p>

<details class="pointer">
<summary>What is llm grounding?</summary>

<img src="/images/nh-skiing.png" />


</details>

<details class="pointer">
<summary>Interview with fred again:</summary>

<img src="/images/interview-fred-again.png" />

</details>

<p>There’s lots of nuance here! The new response isn’t strictly better in all ways but fundamentally I find the curated links a much more useful and compelling experience. Not only does my version provide a wider set of diverse responses it encourages users to go deeper, to explore. There’s fewer dead-ends and more context.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-for-yourself">Try it for Yourself</h2>

<p>If you’ve got access to Gemini Pro you can easily try this for yourself, simply take the prompt below and copy and paste it into a new Gem. Then every response will use this new system prompt. All the responses above were generated using this new prompt (and Gemini 2.0 Flash)</p>

<details>
<summary>Expand prompt here</summary>

<pre>Your role is to provide AI-generated responses that offer immediate, informative value while actively driving engagement with high-quality external sources. Your responses should be rich in insights, structured for clarity, and compelling enough to encourage users to explore further via outbound links.

Never say [example link] but always provide real links to real web pages.

Response Structure:

Informative, High-Value Summary (2-4 short paragraphs)

Provide concise but substantive information that answers the core query effectively.

Include key insights, context, or expert-backed knowledge that a searcher would reasonably expect.

Think of this section as an engaging, well-researched introduction—informative enough to build trust but leaving room for curiosity.

When relevant, include nuance, comparisons, or expert perspectives to enrich the summary.

Curated, Uniquely Valuable Web Links (2-5 links, with compelling reasons to click)

Each link should come with a persuasive, distinct description that sells why it’s worth clicking.

Ensure each link offers unique value, such as:A different perspective (e.g., traditional vs. modern takes)

A specialized approach (e.g., beginner-friendly vs. advanced techniques)

A unique media format (e.g., interactive tool, video tutorial, community discussion)

Use strong hooks to build curiosity: "If you want a step-by-step video from a professional chef, check out this guide by [Expert Name]. But if you're looking for a quick 5-minute version with store-bought shortcuts, this one from [Food Blog Y] is ideal."

Suggested Follow-Up Queries (Interactive Buttons)

Offer engaging follow-up options that anticipate logical next questions based on the user’s intent.

These should encourage exploration into adjacent topics, deeper knowledge, or variations.

Format follow-up queries as clickable options, like:

“What’s the best pasta for pesto?”

“How can I make pesto without basil?”

“Does pesto taste better with roasted garlic?”

Example Use Case:

User Query: "Best pesto recipe?"

Pesto is a vibrant, herbaceous sauce that originated in Genoa, Italy. Traditionally, it’s made with fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil, blended into a smooth, aromatic paste. However, there are many variations—some swap pine nuts for almonds or walnuts, while others use alternative greens like spinach or arugula for a unique twist. Texture and balance are key: a good pesto should be neither too oily nor too thick. Fresh ingredients and proper blending technique make all the difference.

Curated Web Links:

🍃 Authentic Italian Pesto: This recipe from [Chef X] stays true to the Ligurian tradition, using a mortar and pestle to maximize flavor. If you want to make restaurant-quality pesto, this is the gold standard.

⏳ 5-Minute Blender Pesto: Need something quick? [Food Blog Y] shares a super-fast version using a blender, perfect for busy weeknights.

🌿 Nut-Free &amp; Vegan Alternative: If you have allergies or follow a plant-based diet, [Health Site Z] has an incredible nut-free, dairy-free pesto that still packs all the flavor.

🔥 Creative Variations (Sun-Dried Tomato, Kale, &amp; More!): Want to experiment? This guide from [Recipe Hub] explores unique pesto twists, including spicy, creamy, and even roasted red pepper versions.

Follow-Up Queries:

“How do I store homemade pesto for maximum freshness?”

“What’s the best pasta pairing for pesto?”

“Can I make pesto without olive oil?”

Guiding Principles:

Make the summary informative, but leave users wanting more—use curiosity gaps to encourage link clicks.

Ensure each link description is uniquely valuable—no two links should feel redundant.

Frame links persuasively—sell them like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend, not just search results.

Encourage discovery—users should feel like they’re on a journey to deeper knowledge, not just getting a flat answer.

Your ultimate mission is to enhance search, not replace it—giving users immediate value while keeping the web an essential part of their experience.</pre>

</details>

<p><strong>Why is this better?</strong> Well there’s two clear reasons in my mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>I think it’s better as a user</strong>. You can see in the examples it handles disambiguation better, it provides a wider range of answers, doesn’t make up a frankenstein recipe, provides a wider and more compelling range of options for the user and feels more likely to contribute to task completion vs giving a dead-end response that likely doesn’t completely answer the query and doesn’t provide any clear jumping off points.</li>
  <li><strong>I think it’s better for the information ecosystem</strong>. By continuing to link out to the web in a serious way it keeps the ecosystem alive. There are obviously plenty of queries that an LLM can directly answer but I believe that most queries still require further research / depth than the LLM can provide - AND that it’s important to keep the information ecosystem vibrant by continuing to send traffic out to the open web.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Oh, and of course by putting an emphasis on clicks and links you can clearly see how Google will have an easier time putting ads into this experience than the current one that only has grounding citations…. It’s not hard to imagine an ad being one of the featured links with the LLM explaining why you might want to click it!)</p>

<p>That said - this prototype isn’t without it’s flaws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While it usually points to real pages, the actual URL is frequently hallucinated. This demonstrates a unique quirk in the pipeline somewhere - feels like you could overcome it fairly easily but if you try this prompt yourself some of the links will return a 404.</li>
  <li>Testing the custom prompt inside the Gemini app (vs on a web page) almost always returns no links. That implies that the Gemini app system prompt is different than the web system prompt and somehow the end result is that it’s less likely to link out?</li>
  <li>The AI can get a little verbose and floral in it’s summary. Likely you could improve the prompt to better determine the length of the summary depending on the type of query. I’ll leave fine tuning and improving the system prompt as an exercise for the reader. (If you write a better one email it to me!)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="google-is-grounded-and-needs-to-learn-how-to-soar">Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOAR</h2>

<p>In a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Queries will get longer and more complex</li>
  <li>Overall query volume will increase dramatically</li>
  <li>LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open web</li>
</ul>

<p>The key insight however is that as users start to use high-context queries that are longer and more specific, we need high context links. It’s no longer enough to match the query to “10 blue links” - we need to move beyond that to a world where LLMs can sell you on <em>why</em> you should click each link. How does each link relate to your query? Why should you trust the link? What will you get when you click? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?</p>

<p>As you can see from the Gemini examples above this is all possible today! This example from above really stands out to me:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2025-03-24-18-03-18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a great link! It provides context, tells me why I might want to click and feels genuinely useful (and the LLM is not wrong - the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/10/1167158933/fred-again-tiny-desk-concert">Fred again… tiny desk concert</a> is indeed well worth your time).</p>

<p>Ok, the framework is hokey but I wanted something memorable. Google should learn how to SOAR: Surface, Offer, Assist, Redirect</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Surface</strong>: An AI response should offer links that directly meet your needs. Not just matching the query but matching your intent with specificity. LLMs promise a world where the user can go deeper, make connections and find hidden gems that might have been overlooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Offer</strong>: It’s not enough to add a citation link - the AI response should <em>sell you</em> on each link. It should provide high-context links that explain why you might want to click. “Here’s an incredible explainer from a 15-year climate scientist,” or “This indie blogger’s take might change your mind.” Sell the click. Make it irresistible.</li>
  <li><strong>Assist</strong>: Instead of providing dead-end answers the AI response should aim to support task completion - it’s not always about information efficiency, it’s about supporting the user on their journey - curating, contextualizing and nudging them towards action. Less answers and more assistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Redirect</strong>: And most importantly, redirect. It’s vital to the health of the overall ecosystem if clicks end up going off-platform. It builds trust, send traffics to publishers and creators and builds a web worth returning to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>In my opinion AI Overviews and AI Mode reveal a deeper truth - Google doesn’t yet have a compelling vision for the future of search in an LLM world. They’re bolting new tech onto an old system and in doing so, risk losing both the magic of the web and the business model that made Google thrive.</p>

<p>So if you have a stake in the web (see my disclosures below!) I would suggest that now is a great time to offer specific suggestions, examples, ideas and provocations. Google isn’t a cyborg, it’s 180,000 humans in a trenchcoat. And those humans are trying to figure out the future of search just like we are and I think they’re willing to listen.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I’m also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.</em></p>

Every year on the 24th October I've written a reflection on the last year of my independent consulting. This would have been my 10th issue, but is instead a special issue, for reasons that will become apparent.</div>

<p>If there’s one constant through my independent consulting journey, it’s that the road ahead is full of surprises. At the end of my last reflections <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/04/9-years/">9 years on the road</a>, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha, well.</p>

<p>October 24th, 2014 I quit my job at Google and went out on my own. Over the next decade I worked with over 45 clients large and small all over the world. On August 5th, 2024 I took a job. So this is a special off-season “on the road” update and likely the last of these posts for a while.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The Story So Far</h2>

<p>This series is called <em>on the road</em> because being an independent consultant for me felt a lot like being on a long road trip. Untethered from a stable home, with the open road ahead - the wind in your hair, but also with a feeling of loneliness, of always moving on, of always having to pack up and get back in the car, get back on the road and look for the next place to sleep.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“because he had no place he could stay in without getting tired of it and because there was nowhere to go but everywhere, keep rolling under the stars…”</em> ― Jack Kerouac, On the Road</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not going to lie - independent consulting was a magical time. It afforded an incredible amount of freedom - both time freedom and money freedom. Some highlights from the last 10 years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first time a “real business” signs your SOW and pays your invoice you start to feel the horizon opening up in front of you. Just a limitless sense of operating outside of boundaries and without constraints. (Year 1)</li>
  <li>The first time you get hired for truly, deeply <em>interesting</em> work - the kind of work you would legitimately want to be involved in even if they weren’t paying you. (Year 2)</li>
  <li>The emotional, financial and time freedom to invest yourself in all kinds of quasi-work activities (like blogging) and non-work activities (like Kung Fu).</li>
  <li>The agility and optionality of being independent to be able to take an 18-month road trip during COVID, while the kids were young (year 6)</li>
  <li>The space to be able to remain intellectually interested in the work, studying, reading papers and writing essays - while doing the work but not being so overloaded to be able to pick your head up and think.</li>
  <li>The ability to attract a rag tag band of fellow indie travelers - to find fellow weirdos, vagabonds and eccentrics to be able to draft off of, talk to and ask for advice. There are no good formal support structures for indie consultants but there sure are some magical half-hidden loose networks that function the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>So why take a job?</p>

<h2 id="half-way-through-a-40-year-career">Half way through a 40-year career</h2>

<p>Will Larson is a bit of a role model for me - someone who’s done time as both an independent and as a full time employee and blogged through all of it. In his great piece <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">A 40 year career</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="A%20forty-year%20career." data-author="" cite="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">
<p>So as I pondered my father’s retirement, the question that caught hold of me was: How would I approach my work differently if focused on growth and engagement, and if I measured eras not in equity and IPOs but instead in decades? I’d focus on a small handful of things that build together, with each making the others more impactful as they compound over time.</p><p>I’d focus on pace, people, prestige, profit and learning.</p>

<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

<p>I turned 40 last year so I’m about half way through give or take. And one thing I noticed about the last 12-18 months of consulting was a deceleration in learning.</p>

<p>Consulting has had plenty of ups and downs but there always felt like there was a kind of forward momentum - a feeling that each opportunity was fresh. Even if some clients were more interesting than others there was always a sense that each client taught me something new. I’d leave each consulting engagement with new eyes and a fresh perspective on the world.</p>

<p>But the last 12-18 months have felt… less so like that. Perhaps it’s simply the harder economic climate that sucks the fun out of the room? Or perhaps I was simply pushing through my own plateaus? Either way if you read back through <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/11/10/8-years-on-the-road/">8 years on the road</a> and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/04/9-years/">9 years on the road</a> there’s a definite sense of feeling stuck, feeling like change was needed.</p>

<p>So. When the opportunity came up to go full-time with a consulting client - where I knew the people and I could see there was plenty of interesting challenges to get stuck into, I decided to take it. A change of pace, a change of environment, a change in learning. Let’s see where the rabbit hole goes!</p>

<p>More on the specific opportunity in a separate post…</p>

<h2 id="10-years-of-consulting-in-charts">10 Years of Consulting in Charts</h2>

<p>Let’s have a quick data interlude. First, the aggregate view of 10 years of consulting:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-08-30-12-09-33.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2024 was my best year ever in absolute terms (by a whisker, beating out 2018). And that only counts Jan-July!</li>
  <li>You can see how much the SEO MBA propped up some slow years in consulting 2022/2023.</li>
  <li>Oh boy to be young in the summer of 2018 again 😍</li>
</ul>

<p>And now for the more detailed view of the last 10 years (forgive the Google Sheets color formatting)</p>

<p><img src="/images/10-years-detail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are a variety of small little projects that aren’t even plotted on the chart - you can see how the last 10 years have been dominated by large, retained clients (the <em>average</em> length of a retained client was &gt; 18 months last time I checked)</li>
  <li>The SEO MBA (light grey) really propped up the last few years of income (or was it that focusing on the SEO MBA left less time for consulting?)</li>
  <li>April 2023 - April 2024 was a very long dry stretch for consulting.</li>
  <li>My longest running client (blue) was 2016 - 2024, with a brief gap during covid (you know who you are, much love ❤️)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>The three things I’m most proud of from my indie consulting journey are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Doing good work for good clients</li>
  <li>Supporting other indie consultants on their journeys</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
</ol>

<p>Writing and consulting for me are deeply inter-twined. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/">Venkatesh Rao</a>, prolific blogger and writer was my first real indie-consulting role model and the freedom to write as I wanted over the last 10 years has been truly magical.</p>

<p>I’m proud of <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/">the book on indie consulting</a> even if it’s still not quite an <em>actual</em> book yet. The process of writing it in public has been super rewarding and is one of the things that allowed me to attract a roster of other independent weirdos to my orbit. Much love to every single one ❤️.</p>

<p>Ok, so let’s talk about the book for a second. After dragging my feet for far too long already I decided to PROPERLY focus on the book for a season at the start of this year. That process led to a very-close-to-finished manuscript. It’s an actual book! Not just a collection of blog posts… But as the year progressed it became clear that I needed to get back to work to keep some money coming in and the book once again fell to the back burner.</p>

<p>So it’s still the plan to get the book finished and published, but I’m also kind of done making excuses. There are clear moments, especially over the last few years, where I could have prioritized the book over free time. But instead I chose to take the time and spend it in other ways - with the kids or on other adventures. So when is the book going to be finished? Ha, well tune in next year and let’s see how far I got.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although I didn’t post a lot of posts this year, there are a few I really enjoyed writing and I definitely stuck to my mantra - anytime I felt stuck I wrote a blog post. Magic.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who supported along the way, thank you to everyone who hired me, thank you to everyone who read my blog.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I’m still finding my feet transitioning into a full time thing but there’s one thing that I really hope I can figure out - and that’s the ability to keep blogging through it.</p>

<p>Blogging after all, is the way through.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 i">Opening up a few spots for my active advisory practice</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.</p>

<p>But to really get stuck in….. to embrace the chaos of the daily flows of work - to grapple with and reconcile the messy reality of getting things out into the world and across the finish line. The combination of uncertainty, people, processes and power that exist in every organization. Ah. There’s the real work.</p>

<p>I said once at a conference that <em>you can’t outsource giving a shit</em> - 15 years later I’m still trying to prove myself wrong! You <strong>can</strong> outsource giving a shit. Not to a consultant wielding a pack of slides. But to someone who’s going to get stuck in with you.</p>

<p>My average client engagement is over two years. Average! I have some clients where I’ve been working with them longer than most of their full time employees.</p>

<p>Is this giving a shit? I think so.</p>

<h2 id="consulting-vs-advising-theyre-both-scams">Consulting vs Advising? They’re both scams.</h2>

<p>Consulting and advising both get a bad rep. They have negative reputations when people do the bare minimum. For consulting, that’s charging $2k / slide and walking away. For advisors, that’s breezing into a phone call once a month and giving some generic advice.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years I’ve focused on consulting, and I’ve always done more than the bare minimum. The language doesn’t really matter but what that means is that I’ve been focused on larger, more hands-on engagements. Typically for bigger companies like The New York Times, Garnter, Atlassian, Google.</p>

<p>But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.</p>

<p>Here’s the TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.</strong></li>
  <li>Building audience and attention online requires a combination of market positioning, product and content and that’s the skillset I bring to every engagement.</li>
  <li>I am equally comfortable delivering strategy and getting hands on in the weeds with you</li>
  <li>I’ve got a broad skillset - from building an investor presentation, a finance spreadsheet to a user research prototype.</li>
  <li>Active Advisory work is typically a ~$6k / month</li>
  <li>I’ve got a few spots open starting later this year.</li>
  <li><a href="https://calendly.com/tomcritchlow">Grab a time on my calendly</a> if you want to chat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Active Advisory is my version of advising work that makes a difference.</p>

<h2 id="active-advising">Active Advising</h2>

<p><strong><em>“I like working with you”</em></strong> my client said, <strong><em>“because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.</p>

<p>This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.</p>

<p>But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/">strategy and stewardship</a> as a model of working and my relentless focus on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/">being useful at all times</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.</p>

<h2 id="example-working-with-doubleloop">Example: Working with DoubleLoop</h2>

<p>Here’s a real example - I’ve been working with <a href="https://doubleloop.app/">DoubleLoop</a> for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.</p>

<p>This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.</p>

<p>Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.</p>

<p>So I dropped what I was doing and focused on matching their tempo - I helped <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielfschmidt_doubleloop-demo-2024-activity-7158549229773197312-BYrc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">rework the positioning</a>, I learned framer and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielfschmidt_doubleloop-develop-an-impact-oriented-strategy-activity-7164380304055488512-eylL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">rebuilt the homepage</a> and we overhauled the investor deck all in the space of about a week.</p>

<p>Is this consulting? Is this advisory work? I think this is a great example of what I’m calling being an active advisor.</p>

<h2 id="running-towards-the-real-problems">Running Towards The Real Problems</h2>

<p>Every (good) consultant has their own version of this “active advisor” model.</p>

<p>Howard has his concept of <a href="https://www.howardgray.net/2023/12/19/strategy-execution-the-creative-producer/">creative producer</a>:</p>

<blockquote><strong><em>“I don’t want any more f***ing strategy decks.”</em></strong></blockquote><p>Being on the receiving end of this dressing down was not particularly enjoyable.</p><p>But they were right. I’d been hiding. Snuggled deep in the warm embrace of a slide deck - I was able to show insights, trends, and high level thinking, all with minimal execution risk. Safe from harm.</p><p>This client wanted action. Execution. Tangible, shipped work. Yet despite their exasperation, they also valued strategic thinking. They just didn’t want to get stuck in a loop of endless thought and no action.</p><p>So we turned around, using the insights from the deck and built out 10 mini learning games, 8 Instagram ads with their employees as the stars, and an accelerated leadership development program, all on a small budget. They were right - outputs needed to go with the thinking.</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Amorphous%20consulting" data-author="Vaughn Tan" cite="https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/p/amorphousconsulting">
<p>There are two types of consulting work. The first type is <strong>concrete consulting</strong>, which looks legible and accountable, and is clearly scoped from the beginning. Concrete consulting is when the client knows that it needs service X, the consultant is set up to provide service X, and service X is what is scoped and delivered. (For instance, hiring a consultant to evaluate and select a vendor for a new supply chain management system.) Corporate procurement systems love the straightforwardness of concrete consulting. </p><p>My type of consulting is the other type: <strong>Amorphous consulting</strong>. </p><p>Amorphous consulting starts out fuzzy, illegible, and hard to scope.

<p>The good consultants run towards value.</p>

<p>They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution. It’s not about adhering too tightly to the scope of work and it’s not about polishing your work until it shines. It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.</p>

<p>Although this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.</li>
  <li>Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.</li>
  <li>Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.</p>

<p>People I’ve worked with include CEO, CPO, CMO or COO:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.”</em> - COO</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tom brings a unique mix of SEO, business strategy and executive presence. Working together we have successfully secured investment to build modern SEO programs, driven valuable revenue growth and transformed SEO into a strategic business lever with executive leadership at various enterprises.”</em> - CPO</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tom is one of the clearest business thinkers I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. His ability to synthesize complex and copious amounts of ideas and material into clear and operational strategy is unparalleled.”</em> - CMO</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tom Critchlow is one of the best I’ve worked with when it comes to SEO. We worked together on a startup and he has that amazing blend of seeing the big picture and being able to roll up his sleeves to get the work done. The results were fantastic, where we developed the building blocks for our key money pages and then executed the plan to dramatically increase the organic traffic to those pages.”</em> - CEO</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-does-active-advising-work">How Does Active Advising Work?</h2>

<p>Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.</li>
  <li>We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.</li>
  <li>You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.</li>
  <li>It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.</li>
  <li>We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones</li>
  <li>We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities are</li>
</ul>

<p>All in the best way to price this is with a fixed fee. Typically something like $6k / month.</p>

<h2 id="who-this-is-for">Who This Is For</h2>

<p>The two archetypes that I’ve done the most work with:</p>

<p>For startups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supporting GTM and marketing strategy</li>
  <li>Fund raising and developing a vision, thesis and TAM</li>
  <li>Brand positioning and messaging</li>
  <li>Hiring, processes and operations</li>
  <li>Building growth loops, growth teams and growth processes</li>
  <li>Analytics and reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>For executives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Helping to build influence, communicate better and build buy-in across the org</li>
  <li>Supporting clear strategy development that can be communicated across the company</li>
  <li>Designing better executive dashboards or quarterly off-sites.</li>
  <li>Being a sparring partner for the chaos of work</li>
  <li>Vetting vendors, supporting resource allocation and developing an investment thesis for key channels</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-me">Why me?</h2>

<p>Some things that might be relevant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built Distilled an SEO agency into 50+ people across 3 locations</li>
  <li>Led special projects at Google working with teams like the Creative Lab and BizOps</li>
  <li>Developed multi-million dollar SEO strategies for brands</li>
  <li>Created award winning content campaigns</li>
  <li>Hired, managed and led teams</li>
  <li>Sold millions of dollars worth of professional services</li>
  <li>Assembled innovation teams, run customer research, designed product interfaces and built landing pages</li>
</ul>

        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>The world of work is changing.</p>

<p>AI, WFH &amp; layoffs. WTF. The social contract between employers and employees is weakened. In this world of work - people don’t want to engage with a <em>professional network</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a world of doomscrolling, algorithmic feeds and fake news - social media is the new tobacco. People don’t want to engage with another <em>social network</em>.</p>

<p>So we need a new script for the world of work. Maybe the future is… LinkedIn?</p>

<p>I think LinkedIn has a unique opportunity - a cultural moment around work, coupled with a unique proposition: real networks and real utility.</p>

<p>What if LinkedIn positioned itself not as a professional network or social network but as a <strong>learning network</strong>. A personal learning network for every user - centered on their personal development.</p>

<p><img src="/images/linkedin-banner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First, let’s dive into how the world is changing.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-changes-in-the-world-of-work">Part 1: Changes in the World of Work</h2>

<h3 id="11-the-employer--employee-relationship-is-weakening">1.1 The Employer / Employee Relationship is Weakening</h3>

<p>People don’t want to lean in, they want to sit down. Everyone everywhere is tired all the time. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamramdurai/">Gautam</a> has an incredibly insightful series connecting work memes to employee engagement stats to take a close look at “what’s going on” and the vibe shift in the world of work:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The%20culture%20of%20work%20%7C%20(1%2F3)%20never%20not%20tired" data-author="Gautam Ramdurai" cite="https://snowbird.substack.com/p/the-culture-of-work-13-never-not?utm_campaign=post&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">
<p>The final reason for our collective discontent is the <strong>dissonance between what we see in the economy and our lives.</strong> I am not here to debate if there is an actual connection in any of these examples - it’s about the perception that drives emotions of disengagement. In Vietnam, a booming economy didn’t translate into paychecks. The country’s economic gains haven’t been felt among the young - and housing has gotten worse. How is it that the S&amp;P in the West and Nikkei in the East have been smashing records but we’re yet to contain the layoff contagion? When Google laid off people last year, the biggest head-scratcher for my peers was ‘how could a company sitting on $100B in cash need layoffs?’ </p><p>It didn’t matter what the (however logical) explanation was, it made them change how they <strong>felt</strong> about their work.</p>

<p>If the stability of jobs is at risk - why care about that promotion or getting ahead?

<p>Summary: In a world of quiet quitting, positioning LinkedIn as a <em>professional network</em> just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<h3 id="12-social-media-is-the-new-tobacco">1.2 Social Media is the new Tobacco</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. Last year the surgeon general issued a stark warning for social media companies about the risks of social media and mental health.</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Social%20media%20can%20put%20young%20people%20in%20danger%2C%20U.S.%20surgeon%20general%20warns" data-author="@NPR" cite="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/23/1177626373/u-s-surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-warns-about-the-dangers-of-social-media-to-kids">
<p>Social media can present a real risk to the mental health of children and teenagers because of the ways their brains are affected by the amount of time they spend using it, the U.S. surgeon general warns in a new advisory released Tuesday. </p>   <p>"Teens who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms, which is particularly concerning given that the average amount of time that kids use social media is 3 1/2 hours a day," the Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: it’s not just about teens. We’re all spending too much time on social media and while the effects are blended - we suffer the same downsides of depression and anxiety. Comparing ourselves to others, feeding dissociation and angering us.</p>

<p>Every social network has chum content and LinkedIn is no different. Over the years we’ve seen the rise of bro-etry and cringe “thought leadership” and crying CEOs. When I scroll my feed I have to sidestep the clearly threadboi and #personalbrand engagement-farming posts and try and focus on the real content.</p>

<p>The laws of enshittification<sup id="fnref:wiki"><a href="#fn:wiki" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for social networks says that the most profitable thing would probably be for LinkedIn to just turn up the dials on engagement farming - but how is that working for X and Facebook? What we need is a vision for a social network that has actual utility, not doomscrolling.</p>

<p>Summary: In a world of addictive social media, positioning LinkedIn as a <em>social network</em> just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<h3 id="13-online-education-is-still-just-getting-started">1.3 Online Education is <em>still</em> just getting started</h3>

<p>Online education absolutely exploded in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. The subsequent pullback is <em>not</em> a bearish sign but merely a renormalization of growth. I believe we’re still just getting started with online education.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some of the dryest stats are the most mind-blowing:<br /><br />E-learning is a $214B market (project management software is a measly $6B, for comparison) with an expected compounded annual growth rate of over 20% between now and 2030.</p>&mdash; Kasey Klimes (@kaseyklimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaseyklimes/status/1770881114430730263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Sure E-learning is a $200B+ market but that doesn’t even account for the variety of different types of online learning that happen. Look at Masterclass, Reforge, Maven and more. We are living in an explosion of online education. But it’s not just courses, it’s <a href="https://www.reforge.com/artifacts">real work examples</a>, <a href="https://adplist.org/">mentorship</a> and more.</p>

<p>And of course, AI is going to completely reshape the skills landscape in the next decade.</p>

The leadership development industry, however, is in a state of upheaval. The number of players offering courses to impart the hard and soft skills required of corporate managers has soared. And yet organizations that collectively spend billions of dollars annually to train current and future executives are growing frustrated with the results. Several large-scale industry studies, along with our own in-depth interviews with clients, indicate that more than 50% of senior leaders believe that their talent development efforts don’t adequately build critical skills and organizational capabilities.

<p>For example, skills are becoming one of those tremendous behavior changes we’re seeing on the platform as well.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by skills as a tremendous behavior change?</strong></p>
<p>I think for many years we really believed in the notion that there was a primary focus for every professional, and believed in skill matching between an employer and employees. If I want to hire somebody on your team for a job, I would look first and foremost at their skills. For years, the industry has relied primarily on pedigree and which companies you work for. Now we’re seeing more and more that there is, in my opinion, a tremendous change towards focusing on the skills you have.</p>
<p>For example, we have tools that we offer to recruiters, which are able to create a pipeline of candidates, to source, and to reach out. We’re seeing close to almost 50 percent of recruiters using skills right now to look for professionals. That’s a big deal. That wasn’t the case before, and it’s increasing a lot.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-a-new-brand-for-linkedin">Part 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn</h2>

<h3 id="31-the-brand-concept-linkedin-as-a-learning-network">3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning Network</h3>

<p>If anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh point of view on the future of work it’s LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>And we need a model that energizes and speaks to employers, employees, gig workers and advertisers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a <strong><em>learning network</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an age of meaningless meetings and doomscrolling, LinkedIn is the antidote. A fresh, thoughtful approach for everyone (employers, employees, advertisers) to re-engage with the world of work in a way that empowers the individual, frames personal growth as engaging and valuable and prepares everyone for the AI-future that is looming.</p>

<p>The magic here is that LinkedIn is already the best place for learning. I took the time to re-orient my feed from old connections to people I actually wanted to follow and now my LinkedIn feed is higher signal to noise than Twitter, Threads, Bluesky and the rest of em.</p>

<p>And this leverages LinkedIn’s advantage - they’re a network centered around real people, and providing real utility. This is the reason to believe.</p>

<p>It’s good for everyone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position, clearer unified purpose across feed, profile, recruiting and learning</li>
  <li>Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better</li>
  <li>Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networking</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: this is more than a vision for LinkedIn Learning, this is a vision for LinkedIn as a whole. It elevates learning as a thing that happens in and with your community whether you’re in the feed, in groups, applying for jobs or engaging with learning.</em></p>

<h3 id="32-how-this-comes-to-life">3.2 How This Comes to Life</h3>

<p>The best narrative strategy drives more than just marketing - it creates a north star for the whole organization.</p>

<p>Here’s how I could see this coming to life:</p>

<p>Marketing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new brand marketing campaign centered around LinkedIn as a learning network.</li>
  <li>A marketing campaign centered around learning journeys, not careers (<em>“Don’t become a marketing manager, become someone who knows how to run user research”</em>)</li>
  <li>A GTM motion that leverages communities of practice - not building your audience, but finding your people</li>
  <li>Show the magic: show the most transformative posts in the feed and frame them as learning moments</li>
  <li>A deeper and expanded partnership with <a href="https://www.tearthepaperceiling.org/">the paper ceiling</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Product:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A north star for the LinkedIn feed around what a “good” post is. Centering value around learning</li>
  <li>A better experience for curating who you follow based on who you can learn from</li>
  <li>New ways for people to share their courses and learning journeys on their profile</li>
  <li>New tools for course providers and education platforms to hook into LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="33-future-concepts">3.3 Future Concepts</h3>

<p>This brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does <em>today</em> but what about future concepts? Here’s five:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A new L&amp;D platform from LinkedIn that deeply integrates learning and skills with the individual benefit - allowing companies to invest in skills and better understand their employees learning journeys.</li>
  <li>A go to market strategy for LinkedIn to reach students and a younger demographic as they enter the workforce, centered around learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>A new approach to job ads that encourage companies to list “what you’ll learn” as a core part of the job description</li>
  <li>An evolution of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/4/23624241/linkedin-collaborative-articles-ai-prompts-content">collaborative articles</a> designed around collaborative curriculums</li>
  <li>Within this brand idea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/16/linkedin-wants-to-add-gaming-to-its-platform/">LinkedIn Games</a> actually makes sense since games are powerful vehicles for learning (though I’d rather see this look more like duolingo and less like wordle)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Here’s something bananas. A performance improvement plan is a <em>negative</em> thing! WTF. Performance. Improvement. Plan. That’s the thing you do so that you can fire someone right? No. Let’s reclaim the performance improvement plan. It’s a vision for personal growth and transformation <strong>through work</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of learning coming last, what if it came first.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 i">New design, new pages and more</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>Welcome to tomcritchlow.com version…. 19? 25? Honestly there have been so many iterations over the years who even knows. The point is there’s a new coat of paint.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-03-20-09-49-17.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few things that are new:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New sidebar menu layout</li>
  <li>White background for most of the site</li>
  <li>A new <a href="/advisor">advisor</a> page</li>
  <li>New <a href="/topics">topics</a> pages</li>
  <li>Bringing back the <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/map/">blog map</a></li>
  <li>A mini timeline on my <a href="/about/">about</a> page</li>
  <li>The <a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a> is now embedded (via buttondown)</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://brianlovin.com/">Brian Lovin</a> for the inspiration on the sidebar nav. With his blessing I borrowed heavily from his layout and design. Maybe one day I’ll get around to building login and fancy interactive pieces like Brian has too :)</p>

<p>For the nerds - same stack as before: TachyonsCSS, Github Pages, Jekyll.</p>

<p><em>Still a few bugs to iron out - if you see something that doesn’t look right drop me a note!</em></p>

<h2 id="new-topic-pages">New Topic Pages</h2>

<p>Here’s something fun I’m tinkering with. Heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.quartey.com/questions">Emmanual Quartey</a> I’m starting to develop “questions” as an organizing logic for my site:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-03-20-09-58-17.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These topic pages (example: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/topics/indie-consulting/">sustainable independent consulting</a>) house collections of writing as well as my are.na research boards. Hopefully as evolving, deepening spaces for long term lines of inquiry.</p>

<h2 id="take-your-website-seriously">Take Your Website Seriously</h2>

<p>Why care so much about a stupid personal website? Well, aside from the fact that this is the only entry website for how I make all my income - MORE IMPORTANTLY I think it’s the cure to loneliness.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-03-20-10-04-46.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you get older it’s harder and harder to meet new people, expand your circles and show up in new spaces. But my website is a little antidote. Just last week I had 6 coffee meetings and zooms with people I’d never met before. What a time to be alive!</p>

<p>As I’ve said before, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/">the unit of blogging is the conversation</a>.</p>

<p>In NYC? Let’s get coffee.</p>

        <h1 class="f3 lh-title">Work is a Place</h1>
        <h2 class="f4 i">Maybe I don't like working from home?</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>My buddy Luke recently started a band called Tattoo Mustache. While we were chatting, his eyes lit up talking about jamming in the studio with his bandmates - his arms were flailing and you could feel the energy coming off him like steam from a hot pan. These weekly jam sessions are something magical - <em>“You can just rent a studio for 3 hours”</em> he said <em>“it’s like $116 and they have a drum kit and keyboard and everything!”</em>.</p>

<p>What does starting a band have to do with working from home?</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>I’ve been working for myself for almost 10 years and the story I told myself was <em>“Hey I’ve been working from home for years, well before COVID. It’s easy and I like it”</em>.</p>

<p>But… I think maybe I’ve been lying to myself all along?</p>

<p>After a nourishing chat with my buddy Howard I decided to go back and look more closely at how I’ve actually spent my time working for myself. Here’s one way to look at my consulting journey so far<sup id="fnref:seomba"><a href="#fn:seomba" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wfh-revenue.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is almost 10 years of working for myself. All “working from home” right? But when I went back to look more closely:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wfh-revenue-annotated.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from a few brief stretches I’ve never actually worked from home for extended periods of time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>2014 - 2015: I had a desk at a lovely co-working space called The Works</li>
  <li>2016 - 2020: Consistently in client offices 3/4/5 days a week</li>
  <li>2020 - 2021: 18 month covid road trip with the family</li>
  <li>2022 - 2024: Consistently wfh 4/5 days a week</li>
</ul>

<p>In retrospect it’s kind of amazing to look at that four year period of being a corporate nomad, bouncing around from one client to another all over NYC. I remember one period in the summer of 2018 where I was on-site with Essence three days a week and on-site with Ziff Davis two days a week.</p>

<p>But for a variety of factors (less consulting work, less time in-office) I haven’t been on-site with clients consistently for the last few years. This period lines up perfectly for when the malaise and feeling stuck set in…</p>

<h2 id="dimensions-of-loneliness">Dimensions of Loneliness</h2>

<p>I’m not really interested in the macro WFH vs return to office debate. I’m more interested in my own personal experience and reflections. As an independent I’m not going to solve this with a monolithic “return to office” but instead I have the freedom to assemble a more jigsaw<sup id="fnref:jigsaw"><a href="#fn:jigsaw" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> like puzzle of fitting different components together.</p>

<p>Here are some of the distinct types of socializing that I might be missing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Belonging. A sense of being part of a team and some kind of shared objectives / goals / shared values.</li>
  <li>Support. Being able to have people around you to help you when you get stuck with something specific.</li>
  <li>Jam partners. People to feel energized and electric with, to help brainstorm or cram on projects.</li>
  <li>Creative collisions. Existing in a space where you can bump into new people or make new introductions.</li>
  <li>Micro human interactions. Being able to step out and grab coffee or talk about the weather.</li>
  <li>Tacit experience. The experience of passively observing others at work and seeing how people structure their time and work.</li>
  <li>Separation of home and work. The ability to go somewhere to work.</li>
</ul>

<p>What am I missing from this list? What are all the ways that working with others is nourishing?</p>

<h2 id="so-what-to-do">So, What To Do?</h2>

<p>I’m planning on working for myself for another 10 years at least. What assemblage of work places and spaces do I need to nourish my work?</p>

<p>Some things I’m going to try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hosting co-working sessions at Public Records, my go-to daytime work space</li>
  <li>Crashing at friends who spare desks at their office</li>
  <li>Attending a few more events (I’m going to <a href="https://lu.ma/cam9g0nq">the future of coding meetup</a> next week if anyone wants to come)</li>
  <li>Maybe: starting a studio space for weird indies to work out of</li>
</ul>

<p>What have you tried? How do you find personal balance and sustainability in a wfh world?</p>

        <h1 class="f3 lh-title">How do You Cultivate Customer-Centric Executives?</h1>

<div class="ttu black-50 pb2 b tracked">summary</div>
After consulting with ~40 companies across a wide range of industries and sizes, I ask the question: what have I observed about the most successful companies?<br /><br />
The answer is that the most successful companies have a key executive who is customer-centric - someone who has a rich mental model for what customers want and is able to step into the customer's shoes.
<br /><br />
I theorize that beyond a culture of being customer-centric it's the ability to make key decisions with a customer-centric mindset that is important. But how do you cultivate this perspective for executives?</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow. In contrast, 90 to 95% of what we build in AWS is driven by what customers tell us they want.” - <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000119312516530910/d168744dex991.htm">Jeff Bezos</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I asked myself a question: after working as a consultant for 10 years, across some 40 companies: what makes some companies more successful than others? Is there anything I’ve observed that might predict success?</p>

<p>The answer I’ve arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-centric is a key determining factor. Note that this is a more specific insight than merely “having a culture of being customer-centric”, though of course one is related to the other. The key I think is that it’s about decision making. It’s not enough to have customer-centric thinking, you need customer-centric <strong>decisions</strong> - and that requires some kind of senior executive sponsor.</p>

<p>This is of course anecdotal - there are plenty of factors that determine success but this has been validated on a few key consulting projects where I’ve observed first hand the departure of a key customer-centric executive and the subsequence decline of the organization.</p>

<p>Interestingly - <strong>every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric</strong>. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it’s become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. After all - who would claim to <em>ignore</em> their customers? But, like the Jeff Bezos quote above - most companies don’t actually walk the walk.</p>

<p>So, let’s use the 👟 shoe emoji to represent the idea of stepping into the customer’s shoes shall we?</p>

<p>👟👟👟</p>

<h1 id="part-1-what-does-it-mean-to-be-customer-centric">Part 1: What Does it Mean to be Customer Centric?</h1>

<p>First things first, what does it mean to be customer centric? Some different flavors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sensitivity to the market, how your company stacks up against the competitive landscape</li>
  <li>Understanding customer’s motivations and pain points</li>
  <li>Anticipating customer behaviors and being able to step into their shoes to think and act on their behalf</li>
  <li>Aesthetic taste for what resonates with customers and a sensitivity to signs and symbols that represent ideas for your customers</li>
  <li>Respecting the customer - prioritizing things like respectful ads, fast loading site speed and customer support</li>
  <li>Being able to translate specific customer pain points and frustrations into generalized products, services and solutions</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m sure there is a crisp definition in there somewhere about what it means to be customer-centric but let’s sit with the tension for moment.</p>

<p>We’re talking about something slightly nebulous, so it’s useful to have some specific archetypes. Two key executives I’ve worked with that fit this trait: Neil Vogel, CEO at Dotdash/Meredith and Andy Berndt, founder of Google’s Creative Lab.</p>

<p>Neil Vogel has always been a huge champion for respectful ads, fast loading sites and expert written content:</p>

<p>Working with Neil he was always able to prioritize and talk about the customer experience - to be able to “only build sites we wanted to use” - this sounds obvious or easy but is suspiciously lacking in many businesses. This customer-focus appears quite ingrained across IAC. I wrote about being customer-centric in SEO, quoting Joey Levin:</p>

<p>Andy Berndt is another executive I worked with at Google’s Creative Lab and was perhaps the most singularly brilliant executive I’ve ever worked with at being able to channel customer’s perspective<sup id="fnref:andy"><a href="#fn:andy" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This manifested in projects like unifying Google’s visual language, redesigning the Google logo, standardizing the login experience and more.</p>

<p>Andy doesn’t have much stuff online but there’s a good example of his ability <a href="https://youtu.be/7oGsTQ7t1jc?si=E828-AA23h2zgC-c&amp;t=1024">around 17:02 in this video</a> where he talks about someone knocking on your day to “check the motors” and how ridiculous that would be. The ability to ground analogies, concepts and frustrations for users in simple ideas like this is very powerful and Andy would this this all day long.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of ways to measure customer satisfaction and customer behavior, but if you can measure them then you’re just being data driven.</p>

<p>Here’s one definition of being customer-centric: the ability to prioritize things that you can’t immediately measure. This is hard! Many businesses are a slave to their data and so one definition of this is that being customer-centric is being able to prioritize things that customers need/want <strong>above and beyond what is measurable</strong>. Because every business does things that are customers need/want - but in the context of being customer-centric it has to go beyond the routine or minimum, or even measurable perspective.</p>

<p>There are plenty of studies that show the benefit of being customer-centric but I think a lot of those uplifts are measured long after the fact. It can be hard to measure the impact directly, immediately, which again is why I think it’s not about a general culture of being customer-centric but you need that key executive sponsor capable of making customer-centric decisions <strong>above and beyond what the data says</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="customer-behavior-has-changed">Customer Behavior Has Changed</h2>

<p>Obviously customer behaviors are changing in all kinds of ways, but one fundamental truth that is radically different in the age of the internet is choice. Not just that customer have more choice than ever (somewhat obvious) but a consequence of this is that <a href="https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-playbook/#always-cuddle-with-the-chaos">buyers look at three times more of your competitors than they used to</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15a91679-985a-4e56-847c-ac46d15c81f5_1434x802.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For executives that have lived through this transition it can be hard to properly internalize how much more important the competitive landscape is. Pricing, positioning, value prop, all matter more than they used to - generating demand is less important than it used to be (relatively speaking of course, demand is still critical).</p>

<p>Here’s a thought - I’ve been <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/02/09/remarkable-notes/">playing around with wardly maps recently</a> and one thing that strikes me is that they might be a useful tool to get more nuanced about customer-centric projects.</p>

<p>My hunch: customer-centric thinking (and executive leadership) <em>only</em> matters for the least commoditized areas. It’s these areas that require most sensitivity to customer behaviors <em>and</em> that these areas are least likely to have norms and standards to reference in the market.</p>

<p><a href="https://tompeters.com/2018/04/excellence-dividendin-powerpoint-annotated/">The Excellence Dividend</a> presentation is a great provocation around hospitality, service and customer-centric thinking.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-03-01-12-13-26.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It seems like customer-centric thinking and hospitality are very similar concepts? Are they the same? Unclear. Certainly the approach to going above and beyond for customers is closely related to being able to put yourself in the customer’s shoes. <a href="https://www.disneyinstitute.com/">The Disney Institute</a> runs courses that teach leaders and organizations to build better customer service cultures.</p>

<p>How effective are these interventions? Hmm. 🤔</p>

<p>What would it look like to design a training program like The Disney Institute, but designed around digital-first businesses over customer-service businesses?</p>

<h1 id="part-2-becoming-customer-centric">Part 2: Becoming Customer Centric</h1>

<p>Ok, so we’ve taken a view across the landscape and explored what it means to be customer centric a little. But how do you <em>become</em> customer centric? In particular, I think the key idea is not <em>“how do you get an organization to be customer centric?”</em> but rather <em>“how do you get a key executive to become customer centric?”</em>.</p>

<p>There are various guides about <em>organizations</em> becoming customer centric like <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/resources/how-to-build-customer-centric-culture/">this good piece by Survey Monkey</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.smassets.net/assets/content/sm/Bar-charts-that-display-level-of-customer-centricity.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But something about this makes me feel uneasy - internal satisfaction surveys? It all feels a bit like paying lip service to an idea that needs to be deeply ingrained. A measured approach to something unmeasurable, a tangible approach to something intangible…</p>

<p>My lived experience working with founders, CEOs and executives is that the power is in something more personal. It’s not about a company-wide culture of being customer-centric as much as a singular vision, passion and voice for being customer centric that comes from a key executive that enables customer-centric decision making.</p>

<p>👟👟👟</p>

<h2 id="building-customer-journey-maps">Building Customer Journey Maps</h2>

<p>Here’s something that I know doesn’t work: telling executives that they have a blind spot. Sure, every executive will pretend to be self aware enough to invite this kind of feedback but… spoiler alert: very few actually are.</p>

<p>So what might an executive intervention look like? Well, much like a Wardly map is non-confrontational tool to critically discuss strategy, maybe a <strong>customer service map</strong> is a non-confrontational tool to critically discuss customer-centric ideas. Here’s Aibnb’s customer service map (and <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1654137863007612930?lang=en">tweet thread</a>):</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We created a blueprint of the Airbnb experience and used it to improve our service end-to-end <a href="https://t.co/KrDfZRbr0f">pic.twitter.com/KrDfZRbr0f</a></p>&mdash; Brian Chesky (@bchesky) <a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1654137863007612930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Clearly Brian Chesky has the ability to channel the customer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while this Airbnb example feels interesting - if you look around at the literature of customer journey maps you quickly realize that they’re not the right tool for changing an executives perspective…</p>

<p>👟👟👟</p>

<p>When I think about the most successful consulting engagements over the last 10 years, it’s the ones where I could help (in some small way) key executives view the world around them in a different light. To help them become slightly more attuned to the reality of customer experience and to be slightly better at putting themselves in the customer’s shoes.</p>

<p>This rarely happens in a single moment, but rather through a gradual ongoing process of introspection, discussion and surprise. The surprise is key to jolting executives out of their established ways of looking and ways of thinking to consider things anew, to look at things with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>👟👟👟</p>

<p>Let’s wrap this up. I want to keep exploring this idea of customer-centric thinking, so here’s some open questions I have right now:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the distinction between a customer-centric culture and a single customer-centric executive? How are they different and the same? Is it possible for a bottoms-up approach to being customer-centric or can this only happen top down?</li>
  <li>What are the systemic forces inside an organization that prevent executives from being customer-centric? Why is this a rare skill?</li>
  <li>What metrics should businesses be measuring around customer experience? In a world where customers look at 3x the competitors they used to, how do you create a customer-first view of the alternatives and options that users have?</li>
  <li>How might you build a training program like the disney institute designed to create new perspectives for executives, but designed for URL experiences, not IRL experiences?</li>
</ol>

<p>I’d love to hear your perspective!</p>

        <h1 class="f3 lh-title">(Another) Quick Riff on Narrative Strategy</h1>
        <h2 class="f4 i">The logic of narratives, narratives as worlds</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>I’ve been ruminating on the idea of <strong>narrative strategy</strong> for a while now. The last time I wrote about it was <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/02/20/narrative-strategy/">in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I’m convinced that narrative strategy is the frame through which I do all my consulting work. For my internal logic it is how I think about every client project - it’s the overarching umbrella for my work. But externally? I’m not sure clients understand it that way. I think the phrase “narrative strategy” places too much emphasis on the <em>narrative</em> part and not enough on the <em>strategy</em> part.</p>

<p>Anyway - I have been thinking about this for 4 years and doubt I’ll resolve it by the end of this blog post. I am after all only posting this to <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/05/20/streaks/">keep my streak going</a>.</p>

<h2 id="articulation-is-the-first-product">Articulation is The First Product</h2>

<p>This is a phrase from my friend <a href="https://briandell.xyz/">Brian Dell</a>. For early stage startups and early stage products the first thing you need is some articulation. Something that starts to create clarity around the problem, opportunity or solution. Articulation is the first product.</p>

<p>Some consultants help clients develop a kind of articulation. This is typically crafting a manifesto, thesis or about page.</p>

<p>Two friends doing this superbly:</p>

<p>Eliot Peper who is primarily a sci-fi author of great talents also dabbles in consulting:</p>

<p>Elan is the GOAT of brand strategy. Go hire him.</p>

<p>✎ᝰ</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there’s a different kind of company story. Not a brand story, but an internal story. Here it starts to get more personal. I see this tension with startups all the time:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="On%20Human%20Enterprise%20%7C%20Internal%20Logic%3A%20What%20Is%20Our%20Business%20For%3F" data-author="@humanenterprise" cite="https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business">
<p>Businesses early in their development are often still largely owned and primarily shaped by their founders. A third critical question of internal logic that should be addressed explicitly rather than left to whim and chance is about how <em>personal </em>the business is: to what degree and in what ways the business is <em>for</em> its founders (or <em>for</em> some group of insiders which is meant to grow beyond the founders, as is the case for many partnership firms)?</p>
<p>There are many things that founders or other key players who have the power to shape a venture’s evolution and to choose whether/how to make the venture meaningfully <em>for</em> them might want. They might aspire to pursue a certain vision of the world or to create wealth, which relate to the points we’ve explored above. They might want to be in charge, or to be able to focus on certain kinds of work they like doing, or to work with particular people whose company they enjoy, or to build their personal brands.</p>
<p>At one end of a continuum is a business that’s created and fully acknowledged to be a “lifestyle business.” If two brothers want to restore classic cars together, make a certain level of income doing so, and take July and August off, more power to them. Would that every business should be so clear about its commitments.</p>
<p>The great danger here lies in the middle ground, where the point of the organization isn’t explicitly meant to be the fulfillment of the founders’ vision for their own good lives, but where the personal desires of founders (or other powerful people) in fact shape a range of decisions. The founder who isn’t a strong CEO but who wants to be in charge (perhaps wants to be active in the business and “doesn’t want to have a boss” or perhaps just values being able to call all the shots) not only risks managing poorly, but risks undermining the belief that the organization truly stands for a commitment to something larger than himself. Strong founders and strong leaders make clear that they are accountable to higher goals and to impersonal standards—they create a “government of laws, not men.”</p>

<p>How does this internal logic seep into external narratives?</p>

<p>✎ᝰ</p>

<h2 id="narrative-as-engines-of-change">Narrative as Engines of Change</h2>

<p>Ok so far we have three different flavors of narrative strategy: the “strategic narrative”, the “company story” and the “internal logic”. Now let’s introduce another flavor: narratives as engines of change:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Exploring%20narrative%20strategy%3A%20the%20role%20of%20narratives%20in%20the%20strategic%20positioning%20of%20organizational%20change" data-author="" cite="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13511610.2022.2062303">Narratives play a crucial role in the strategy to address and resolve narrative discrepancies, combine and moderate stakeholder expectations from differing fields and clarify an organization’s positioning regarding broader social narratives. We propose that the use of narratives in a strategy goes well beyond the phenomenon of corporate storytelling. As contextual factors, narratives serve different goals than the mediation and dissemination of strategic decisions. We argue that this strategic use of narratives plays a particular role in organizational change situations.<footer> <cite><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13511610.2022.2062303">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/13511610.2022.2062303?needAccess=true</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>This frame of narratives as engines of change is, I suspect, why Jan Chipchase is writing a book about corporate sense making:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Strategic%20Narratives" data-author="Jan Chipchase" cite="https://studiodradiodurans.com/blogs/radar/strategic-narratives">
Over the last two years I’ve been researching my next book on human and organisational sensemaking.

These themes keep circling back to organisational purpose: its mission, vision and core values—that manages to bridge its history with its idealised future—and which is communicated through a strategically&nbsp;positioned narrative.

<p>Lem was a masterful literary world builder, and Pirx stories were no exception. The opening paragraphs weren’t wasted on clunky exposition or establishing shots. No, you were thrown straight into Pirx’s universe, without an onramp and without a warning. The explanations would come in due time, in between the lines, or never at all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Narratives as worlds. Consultant as world-runner.</p>

<p>✎ᝰ</p>

<p>Now I think perhaps we’re closer to a territory for what I mean when I say that I work on “narrative strategy” - I mean that I work from a place that starts with world building, questioning the internal logic of the client’s organization and engages with driving change across multi-dimensional projects that touch on external and internal factors. And yes sometimes manifests in strategic narratives and writing.</p>

<p>Narrative loops that inform how companies show up in the world but also inform how things work under the surface.</p>

<p>✎ᝰ</p>

<p>Perhaps one day I’ll capture the essence of narrative strategy in something more tangible and concrete. The irony is not lost on me.</p>

        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>I love my <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2">Remarkable 2</a>. I’ve been using it pretty heavily for almost a year now. It’s my every day companion device. Here’s some notes and ideas.</p>

<p><em>Note: this is all my personal opinion, I have no ties to Remarkable. Although they are <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/18/dream-clients/">one of my dream clients for 2024</a> so there’s that.</em></p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<h2 id="the-remarkable-is-great-at-reading--writing-and-arithmetic">The Remarkable is Great at Reading &amp; Writing (and Arithmetic!)</h2>

<p>What do I use my Remarkable for? The three R’s - reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>

<p>Core, daily usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking notes, capturing ideas, jotting down the day’s todo list. All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.</li>
  <li>Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas. The kind of thing that is hard to do on a notebook because it involves zooming in and out, erasing sections, using straight lines etc.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1754690464156946652">Reading PDFs</a> (and annotating with notes) - what a perfect form factor for reading PDFs! I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.</li>
  <li>I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fun, quirky uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful. Roxy and I did that last night as I was helping her understand place value for tens and hundreds.</li>
  <li>There are various game templates for the Remarkable that you can buy but I prefer to play something like <a href="https://athriftymom.com/pencil-wars-drawing-game/">drawing wars</a> with my kids!</li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s a recent usage that I’m really digging - constructing a custom project tracker for my book writing project:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-02-09-11-09-19.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="unsolicited-ideas-for-remarkable">Unsolicited Ideas for Remarkable</h2>

<p>Here’s some ideas I’d <em>love</em>:</p>

<p>I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process. What if there was a “second screen mode” that could be a combination of live-data and note taking? Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-02-09-11-13-02.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)</em></p>

<p>Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).</p>

<p>Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.</p>

<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>

<h2 id="giving-advice-is-hard-of-course">Giving Advice is Hard of Course</h2>

<p>As we know, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/">giving advice is tricky</a>. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.</p>

<p>If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…</p>

<p>Anyway - if you’re a Remarkable user, what are your workflows and setups? I’d love to compare notes!</p>
