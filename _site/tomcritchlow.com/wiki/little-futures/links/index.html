  <p>Over the past couple of months, I have been playing around with the idea that you can take great content that already exists, package it up, and test people on it to create playlists that enable better learning and retention than just scanning an article, watching a video, or reading a book does on its own.</p>

  <p>You can take this course after having read Loonshots or in real-time while you read it. Each chapter has a section below, each with additional resources - youtube videos, podcasts, blog posts and articles - and each section ends with a quiz. The quizzes are there to help you make sure that you’ve locked the information in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to reading the book, the course should take about 8-10 hours to complete, including reading, watching and listening to the additional resources and taking the quizzes.  I hope that you find it to be time well-spent. If you complete the course, including the final assignment, I will send you a Loonshots Diploma:</p>

  <p>in this field, and the Big Future claims made by PUS/PEST practitioners are contrasted to the Little Futures of everyday life. With the aid of a ‘speculative’ sensibility, Little Futures are then shown to be potential sources of Big Futures. The paper ends with a preliminary attempt to theorize the complex interactions of Big and Little Futures through Isabelle Stengers’ (2010) notion of an ‘ecology of practices’.  </p>
