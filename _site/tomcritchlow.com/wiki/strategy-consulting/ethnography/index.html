<blockquote>
  <p>For the past 10–12 days people have been participating in a diary study about memory that I’m leading on.
From the very start I really wanted the diary to be a physical thing that participants received in the post. I wanted it to be something that delighted them, made them feel like taking part was a special and valued experience.</p>

  <p>Combining paper and Whatsapp worked a dream. We asked participants to complete the tasks on paper and then photograph them and send them to us on Whatsapp.</p>
