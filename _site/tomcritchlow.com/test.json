  "<p>Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users <em>and</em> in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.</p>",
  "<p>For decades, Google’s advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.</p>",
  "<p>First with AI Overviews, then most recently with AI Mode - both experiments from Google seem short-sighted as experiences:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/ai-overviews-ai-mode.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Not a link in sight, search has turned into a dead-end.</p>",
  "<p>How did we get here?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"google-is-grounded\">Google is Grounded</h2>",
  "<p>“Grounding” an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. You’d think grounding means: “Find the best sources, then write the answer.” But with LLMs, it’s often: “Write the answer, then find sources that sort of back it up.” It’s like writing a school essay and adding the citations after.</p>",
  "<p>Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding, the answer is used to inform the search results.</p>",
  "<p>If I understand correctly (and I’ll be the first to admit I’m no expert here) the grounding process essentially augments the LLM with key info from web pages to ensure that each of the claims and statements in the response is correct and true. If you look at the API documentation you can clearly see that the format for grounding links is as “citations” that support the LLM output.</p>",
  "<p>For a technical overview of the grounding process <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview\">see this post</a>, or for a more specific look at how Gemini grounds in search <a href=\"https://dejan.ai/blog/hacking-gemini/\">see this post</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it’s an effective part of the response.</p>",
  "<p>Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.</p>",
  "<p>It seems fairly likely to me that the grounding process is what’s powering the links included in both AI Overviews and AI Mode. They barely link out at all and when they do the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/ai-citations.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes - often providing dead-end answers. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.</p>",
  "<p>It’s not that grounding is wrong - it’s a valuable part of the process to generate accurate responses. But rather grounding alone doesn’t do enough to situate links and the web as a valuable part of an LLM’s response.</p>",
  "<p>I think Google can do better.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-better-way\">A Better Way</h2>",
  "<p>Needless to say, lots of people are concerned about an information ecosystem that destroys the vibrancy, diversity and depth of the open web. I believe there’s a better way - and while playing around <strong>I found that simply writing a better system prompt inside Gemini gave me radically better results than the current AI Mode response</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>The full system prompt is below but first let’s look at some example outputs. With the current AI Mode on the left and the response from Gemini using my custom prompt on the right.</p>",

  "<p>There’s lots of nuance here! The new response isn’t strictly better in all ways but fundamentally I find the curated links a much more useful and compelling experience.

  "<p><strong>Why is this better?</strong> Well there’s two clear reasons in my mind:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li><strong>I think it’s better as a user</strong>. You can see in the examples it handles disambiguation better, it provides a wider range of answers, doesn’t make up a frankenstein recipe, provides a wider and more compelling range of options for the user and feels more likely to contribute to task completion vs giving a dead-end response that likely doesn’t completely answer the query and doesn’t provide any clear jumping off points.</li><br />  <li><strong>I think it’s better for the information ecosystem</strong>. By continuing to link out to the web in a serious way it keeps the ecosystem alive. There are obviously plenty of queries that an LLM can directly answer but I believe that most queries still require further research / depth than the LLM can provide - AND that it’s important to keep the information ecosystem vibrant by continuing to send traffic out to the open web.</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>(Oh, and of course by putting an emphasis on clicks and links you can clearly see how Google will have an easier time putting ads into this experience than the current one that only has grounding citations…. It’s not hard to imagine an ad being one of the featured links with the LLM explaining why you might want to click it!)</p>",
  "<p>That said - this prototype isn’t without it’s flaws:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>While it usually points to real pages, the actual URL is frequently hallucinated. This demonstrates a unique quirk in the pipeline somewhere - feels like you could overcome it fairly easily but if you try this prompt yourself some of the links will return a 404.</li><br />  <li>Testing the custom prompt inside the Gemini app (vs on a web page) almost always returns no links. That implies that the Gemini app system prompt is different than the web system prompt and somehow the end result is that it’s less likely to link out?</li><br />  <li>The AI can get a little verbose and floral in it’s summary. Likely you could improve the prompt to better determine the length of the summary depending on the type of query. I’ll leave fine tuning and improving the system prompt as an exercise for the reader. (If you write a better one email it to me!)</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"google-is-grounded-and-needs-to-learn-how-to-soar\">Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOAR</h2>",
  "<p>In a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Queries will get longer and more complex</li><br />  <li>Overall query volume will increase dramatically</li><br />  <li>LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open web</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>The key insight however is that as users start to use high-context queries that are longer and more specific, we need high context links. It’s no longer enough to match the query to “10 blue links” - we need to move beyond that to a world where LLMs can sell you on <em>why</em> you should click each link. How does each link relate to your query? Why should you trust the link? What will you get when you click? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?</p>",

  "<p>Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users <em>and</em> in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.</p>",
  "<p>For decades, Google’s advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.</p>",
  "<p>First with AI Overviews, then most recently with AI Mode - both experiments from Google seem short-sighted as experiences:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/ai-overviews-ai-mode.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

  "<h2 id=\"google-is-grounded\">Google is Grounded</h2>",
  "<p>“Grounding” an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. You’d think grounding means: “Find the best sources, then write the answer.” But with LLMs, it’s often: “Write the answer, then find sources that sort of back it up.” It’s like writing a school essay and adding the citations after.</p>",
  "<p>Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding, the answer is used to inform the search results.</p>",
  "<p>If I understand correctly (and I’ll be the first to admit I’m no expert here) the grounding process essentially augments the LLM with key info from web pages to ensure that each of the claims and statements in the response is correct and true. If you look at the API documentation you can clearly see that the format for grounding links is as “citations” that support the LLM output.</p>",
  "<p>For a technical overview of the grounding process <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview\">see this post</a>, or for a more specific look at how Gemini grounds in search <a href=\"https://dejan.ai/blog/hacking-gemini/\">see this post</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it’s an effective part of the response.</p>",
  "<p>Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.</p>",
  "<p>It seems fairly likely to me that the grounding process is what’s powering the links included in both AI Overviews and AI Mode. They barely link out at all and when they do the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/ai-citations.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes - often providing dead-end answers. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.</p>",
  "<p>It’s not that grounding is wrong - it’s a valuable part of the process to generate accurate responses. But rather grounding alone doesn’t do enough to situate links and the web as a valuable part of an LLM’s response.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Why is this better?</strong> Well there’s two clear reasons in my mind:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li><strong>I think it’s better as a user</strong>. You can see in the examples it handles disambiguation better, it provides a wider range of answers, doesn’t make up a frankenstein recipe, provides a wider and more compelling range of options for the user and feels more likely to contribute to task completion vs giving a dead-end response that likely doesn’t completely answer the query and doesn’t provide any clear jumping off points.</li><br />  <li><strong>I think it’s better for the information ecosystem</strong>. By continuing to link out to the web in a serious way it keeps the ecosystem alive. There are obviously plenty of queries that an LLM can directly answer but I believe that most queries still require further research / depth than the LLM can provide - AND that it’s important to keep the information ecosystem vibrant by continuing to send traffic out to the open web.</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>(Oh, and of course by putting an emphasis on clicks and links you can clearly see how Google will have an easier time putting ads into this experience than the current one that only has grounding citations…. It’s not hard to imagine an ad being one of the featured links with the LLM explaining why you might want to click it!)</p>",
  "<p>That said - this prototype isn’t without it’s flaws:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>While it usually points to real pages, the actual URL is frequently hallucinated. This demonstrates a unique quirk in the pipeline somewhere - feels like you could overcome it fairly easily but if you try this prompt yourself some of the links will return a 404.</li><br />  <li>Testing the custom prompt inside the Gemini app (vs on a web page) almost always returns no links. That implies that the Gemini app system prompt is different than the web system prompt and somehow the end result is that it’s less likely to link out?</li><br />  <li>The AI can get a little verbose and floral in it’s summary. Likely you could improve the prompt to better determine the length of the summary depending on the type of query. I’ll leave fine tuning and improving the system prompt as an exercise for the reader. (If you write a better one email it to me!)</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"google-is-grounded-and-needs-to-learn-how-to-soar\">Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOAR</h2>",
  "<p>In a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Queries will get longer and more complex</li><br />  <li>Overall query volume will increase dramatically</li><br />  <li>LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open web</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>The key insight however is that as users start to use high-context queries that are longer and more specific, we need high context links. It’s no longer enough to match the query to “10 blue links” - we need to move beyond that to a world where LLMs can sell you on <em>why</em> you should click each link. How does each link relate to your query? Why should you trust the link? What will you get when you click? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?</p>",
  "<p>As you can see from the Gemini examples above this is all possible today! This example from above really stands out to me:</p>",

  "<h2 id=\"the-story-so-far\">The Story So Far</h2>",
  "<p>This series is called <em>on the road</em> because being an independent consultant for me felt a lot like being on a long road trip. Untethered from a stable home, with the open road ahead - the wind in your hair, but also with a feeling of loneliness, of always moving on, of always having to pack up and get back in the car, get back on the road and look for the next place to sleep.</p>",

  "<p>I’m not going to lie - independent consulting was a magical time. It afforded an incredible amount of freedom - both time freedom and money freedom. Some highlights from the last 10 years:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The first time a “real business” signs your SOW and pays your invoice you start to feel the horizon opening up in front of you. Just a limitless sense of operating outside of boundaries and without constraints. (Year 1)</li><br />  <li>The first time you get hired for truly, deeply <em>interesting</em> work - the kind of work you would legitimately want to be involved in even if they weren’t paying you. (Year 2)</li><br />  <li>The emotional, financial and time freedom to invest yourself in all kinds of quasi-work activities (like blogging) and non-work activities (like Kung Fu).</li><br />  <li>The agility and optionality of being independent to be able to take an 18-month road trip during COVID, while the kids were young (year 6)</li><br />  <li>The space to be able to remain intellectually interested in the work, studying, reading papers and writing essays - while doing the work but not being so overloaded to be able to pick your head up and think.</li><br />  <li>The ability to attract a rag tag band of fellow indie travelers - to find fellow weirdos, vagabonds and eccentrics to be able to draft off of, talk to and ask for advice. There are no good formal support structures for indie consultants but there sure are some magical half-hidden loose networks that function the same way.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p>Consulting has had plenty of ups and downs but there always felt like there was a kind of forward momentum - a feeling that each opportunity was fresh. Even if some clients were more interesting than others there was always a sense that each client taught me something new. I’d leave each consulting engagement with new eyes and a fresh perspective on the world.</p>",
  "<p>But the last 12-18 months have felt… less so like that. Perhaps it’s simply the harder economic climate that sucks the fun out of the room?

Much love to every single one ❤️.</p>",
  "<p>Ok, so let’s talk about the book for a second. After dragging my feet for far too long already I decided to PROPERLY focus on the book for a season at the start of this year. That process led to a very-close-to-finished manuscript. It’s an actual book! Not just a collection of blog posts… But as the year progressed it became clear that I needed to get back to work to keep some money coming in and the book once again fell to the back burner.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s still the plan to get the book finished and published, but I’m also kind of done making excuses. There are clear moments, especially over the last few years, where I could have prioritized the book over free time.

Ha, well tune in next year and let’s see how far I got.</p>",

  "<h2 id=\"the-story-so-far\">The Story So Far</h2>",
  "<p>This series is called <em>on the road</em> because being an independent consultant for me felt a lot like being on a long road trip. Untethered from a stable home, with the open road ahead - the wind in your hair, but also with a feeling of loneliness, of always moving on, of always having to pack up and get back in the car, get back on the road and look for the next place to sleep.</p>",

  "<p>I’m not going to lie - independent consulting was a magical time. It afforded an incredible amount of freedom - both time freedom and money freedom. Some highlights from the last 10 years:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The first time a “real business” signs your SOW and pays your invoice you start to feel the horizon opening up in front of you. Just a limitless sense of operating outside of boundaries and without constraints. (Year 1)</li><br />  <li>The first time you get hired for truly, deeply <em>interesting</em> work - the kind of work you would legitimately want to be involved in even if they weren’t paying you. (Year 2)</li><br />  <li>The emotional, financial and time freedom to invest yourself in all kinds of quasi-work activities (like blogging) and non-work activities (like Kung Fu).</li><br />  <li>The agility and optionality of being independent to be able to take an 18-month road trip during COVID, while the kids were young (year 6)</li><br />  <li>The space to be able to remain intellectually interested in the work, studying, reading papers and writing essays - while doing the work but not being so overloaded to be able to pick your head up and think.</li><br />  <li>The ability to attract a rag tag band of fellow indie travelers - to find fellow weirdos, vagabonds and eccentrics to be able to draft off of, talk to and ask for advice. There are no good formal support structures for indie consultants but there sure are some magical half-hidden loose networks that function the same way.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p>Consulting has had plenty of ups and downs but there always felt like there was a kind of forward momentum - a feeling that each opportunity was fresh. Even if some clients were more interesting than others there was always a sense that each client taught me something new. I’d leave each consulting engagement with new eyes and a fresh perspective on the world.</p>",
  "<p>But the last 12-18 months have felt… less so like that. Perhaps it’s simply the harder economic climate that sucks the fun out of the room? Or perhaps I was simply pushing through my own plateaus?

Much love to every single one ❤️.</p>",
  "<p>Ok, so let’s talk about the book for a second. After dragging my feet for far too long already I decided to PROPERLY focus on the book for a season at the start of this year. That process led to a very-close-to-finished manuscript. It’s an actual book! Not just a collection of blog posts… But as the year progressed it became clear that I needed to get back to work to keep some money coming in and the book once again fell to the back burner.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s still the plan to get the book finished and published, but I’m also kind of done making excuses.

  "<p>For the past 10 years I’ve focused on consulting, and I’ve always done more than the bare minimum.

  "<p>But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s the TL;DR:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.</strong></li><br />  <li>Building audience and attention online requires a combination of market positioning, product and content and that’s the skillset I bring to every engagement.</li><br />  <li>I am equally comfortable delivering strategy and getting hands on in the weeds with you</li><br />  <li>I’ve got a broad skillset - from building an investor presentation, a finance spreadsheet to a user research prototype.</li><br />  <li>Active Advisory work is typically a ~$6k / month</li><br />  <li>I’ve got a few spots open starting later this year.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://calendly.com/tomcritchlow\">Grab a time on my calendly</a> if you want to chat.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<h2 id=\"active-advising\">Active Advising</h2>",
  "<p><strong><em>“I like working with you”</em></strong> my client said, <strong><em>“because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”</em></strong>.</p>",
  "<p>This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.</p>",
  "<p>This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.</p>",
  "<p>But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/\">strategy and stewardship</a> as a model of working and my relentless focus on <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/\">being useful at all times</a>.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"example-working-with-doubleloop\">Example: Working with DoubleLoop</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s a real example - I’ve been working with <a href=\"https://doubleloop.app/\">DoubleLoop</a> for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.</p>",
  "<p>Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.</p>",

  "<p>They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution.

It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"its-what-clients-want\">It’s What Clients Want</h2>",
  "<p>Although this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.</li><br />  <li>Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.</li><br />  <li>Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.</p>",

  "<h2 id=\"how-does-active-advising-work\">How Does Active Advising Work?</h2>",
  "<p>Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.</li><br />  <li>We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.</li><br />  <li>You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.</li><br />  <li>It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Because of this:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.</li><br />  <li>We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones</li><br />  <li>We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities are</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>All in the best way to price this is with a fixed fee. Typically something like $6k / month.</p>",

  "<p>Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.</p>",
  "<p>But to really get stuck in….. to embrace the chaos of the daily flows of work - to grapple with and reconcile the messy reality of getting things out into the world and across the finish line. The combination of uncertainty, people, processes and power that exist in every organization. Ah. There’s the real work.</p>",
  "<p>I said once at a conference that <em>you can’t outsource giving a shit</em> - 15 years later I’m still trying to prove myself wrong! You <strong>can</strong> outsource giving a shit. Not to a consultant wielding a pack of slides. But to someone who’s going to get stuck in with you.</p>",

  "<p>Consulting and advising both get a bad rep. They have negative reputations when people do the bare minimum. For consulting, that’s charging $2k / slide and walking away. For advisors, that’s breezing into a phone call once a month and giving some generic advice.</p>",
  "<p>For the past 10 years I’ve focused on consulting, and I’ve always done more than the bare minimum. The language doesn’t really matter but what that means is that I’ve been focused on larger, more hands-on engagements. Typically for bigger companies like The New York Times, Garnter, Atlassian, Google.</p>",
  "<p>But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s the TL;DR:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.</strong></li><br />  <li>Building audience and attention online requires a combination of market positioning, product and content and that’s the skillset I bring to every engagement.</li><br />  <li>I am equally comfortable delivering strategy and getting hands on in the weeds with you</li><br />  <li>I’ve got a broad skillset - from building an investor presentation, a finance spreadsheet to a user research prototype.</li><br />  <li>Active Advisory work is typically a ~$6k / month</li><br />  <li>I’ve got a few spots open starting later this year.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://calendly.com/tomcritchlow\">Grab a time on my calendly</a> if you want to chat.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<h2 id=\"active-advising\">Active Advising</h2>",
  "<p><strong><em>“I like working with you”</em></strong> my client said, <strong><em>“because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”</em></strong>.</p>",
  "<p>This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.</p>",
  "<p>This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.</p>",
  "<p>But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/\">strategy and stewardship</a> as a model of working and my relentless focus on <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/\">being useful at all times</a>.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"example-working-with-doubleloop\">Example: Working with DoubleLoop</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s a real example - I’ve been working with <a href=\"https://doubleloop.app/\">DoubleLoop</a> for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.</p>",
  "<p>Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.</p>",
  "<p>So I dropped what I was doing and focused on matching their tempo - I helped <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielfschmidt_doubleloop-demo-2024-activity-7158549229773197312-BYrc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\">rework the positioning</a>, I learned framer and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielfschmidt_doubleloop-develop-an-impact-oriented-strategy-activity-7164380304055488512-eylL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\">rebuilt the homepage</a> and we overhauled the investor deck all in the space of about a week.</p>",

The first type is <strong>concrete consulting</strong>, which looks legible and accountable, and is clearly scoped from the beginning. Concrete consulting is when the client knows that it needs service X, the consultant is set up to provide service X, and service X is what is scoped and delivered. (For instance, hiring a consultant to evaluate and select a vendor for a new supply chain management system.) Corporate procurement systems love the straightforwardness of concrete consulting. </p><p>My type of consulting is the other type: <strong>Amorphous consulting</strong>. </p><p>Amorphous consulting starts out fuzzy, illegible, and hard to scope.

  "<p>The good consultants run towards value.</p>",
  "<p>They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution. It’s not about adhering too tightly to the scope of work and it’s not about polishing your work until it shines. It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"its-what-clients-want\">It’s What Clients Want</h2>",
  "<p>Although this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.</li><br />  <li>Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.</li><br />  <li>Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.</p>",
  "<p>People I’ve worked with include CEO, CPO, CMO or COO:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p><em>“Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.”</em> - COO</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p><em>“Tom brings a unique mix of SEO, business strategy and executive presence. Working together we have successfully secured investment to build modern SEO programs, driven valuable revenue growth and transformed SEO into a strategic business lever with executive leadership at various enterprises.”</em> - CPO</p><br /></blockquote>",

The results were fantastic, where we developed the building blocks for our key money pages and then executed the plan to dramatically increase the organic traffic to those pages.”</em> - CEO</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<h2 id=\"how-does-active-advising-work\">How Does Active Advising Work?</h2>",
  "<p>Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.</li><br />  <li>We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.</li><br />  <li>You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.</li><br />  <li>It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Because of this:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.</li><br />  <li>We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones</li><br />  <li>We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities are</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>All in the best way to price this is with a fixed fee. Typically something like $6k / month.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"who-this-is-for\">Who This Is For</h2>",
  "<p>The two archetypes that I’ve done the most work with:</p>",
  "<p>For startups:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>Supporting GTM and marketing strategy</li><br />  <li>Fund raising and developing a vision, thesis and TAM</li><br />  <li>Brand positioning and messaging</li><br />  <li>Hiring, processes and operations</li><br />  <li>Building growth loops, growth teams and growth processes</li><br />  <li>Analytics and reporting</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>For executives:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>Helping to build influence, communicate better and build buy-in across the org</li><br />  <li>Supporting clear strategy development that can be communicated across the company</li><br />  <li>Designing better executive dashboards or quarterly off-sites.</li><br />  <li>Being a sparring partner for the chaos of work</li><br />  <li>Vetting vendors, supporting resource allocation and developing an investment thesis for key channels</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p>And we need a model that energizes and speaks to employers, employees, gig workers and advertisers.</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a <strong><em>learning network</em></strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>In an age of meaningless meetings and doomscrolling, LinkedIn is the antidote. A fresh, thoughtful approach for everyone (employers, employees, advertisers) to re-engage with the world of work in a way that empowers the individual, frames personal growth as engaging and valuable and prepares everyone for the AI-future that is looming.</p>",
  "<p>The magic here is that LinkedIn is already the best place for learning. I took the time to re-orient my feed from old connections to people I actually wanted to follow and now my LinkedIn feed is higher signal to noise than Twitter, Threads, Bluesky and the rest of em.</p>",
  "<p>And this leverages LinkedIn’s advantage - they’re a network centered around real people, and providing real utility. This is the reason to believe.</p>",
  "<p>It’s good for everyone:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position, clearer unified purpose across feed, profile, recruiting and learning</li><br />  <li>Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better</li><br />  <li>Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networking</li><br /></ul>",

  "<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s something bananas. A performance improvement plan is a <em>negative</em> thing! WTF. Performance. Improvement. Plan. That’s the thing you do so that you can fire someone right?

  "<p>The answer I’ve arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-centric is a key determining factor. Note that this is a more specific insight than merely “having a culture of being customer-centric”, though of course one is related to the other. The key I think is that it’s about decision making. It’s not enough to have customer-centric thinking, you need customer-centric <strong>decisions</strong> - and that requires some kind of senior executive sponsor.</p>",
  "<p>This is of course anecdotal - there are plenty of factors that determine success but this has been validated on a few key consulting projects where I’ve observed first hand the departure of a key customer-centric executive and the subsequence decline of the organization.</p>",
  "<p>Interestingly - <strong>every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric</strong>. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it’s become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. After all - who would claim to <em>ignore</em> their customers?

  "<p>My hunch: customer-centric thinking (and executive leadership) <em>only</em> matters for the least commoditized areas.

  "<p>My lived experience working with founders, CEOs and executives is that the power is in something more personal.

Is it possible for a bottoms-up approach to being customer-centric or can this only happen top down?</li><br />  <li>What are the systemic forces inside an organization that prevent executives from being customer-centric? Why is this a rare skill?</li><br />  <li>What metrics should businesses be measuring around customer experience? In a world where customers look at 3x the competitors they used to, how do you create a customer-first view of the alternatives and options that users have?</li><br />  <li>How might you build a training program like the disney institute designed to create new perspectives for executives, but designed for URL experiences, not IRL experiences?</li><br /></ol>",

  "<p>Recently I asked myself a question: after working as a consultant for 10 years, across some 40 companies: what makes some companies more successful than others? Is there anything I’ve observed that might predict success?</p>",
  "<p>The answer I’ve arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-centric is a key determining factor. Note that this is a more specific insight than merely “having a culture of being customer-centric”, though of course one is related to the other. The key I think is that it’s about decision making. It’s not enough to have customer-centric thinking, you need customer-centric <strong>decisions</strong> - and that requires some kind of senior executive sponsor.</p>",
  "<p>This is of course anecdotal - there are plenty of factors that determine success but this has been validated on a few key consulting projects where I’ve observed first hand the departure of a key customer-centric executive and the subsequence decline of the organization.</p>",
  "<p>Interestingly - <strong>every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric</strong>. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it’s become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. After all - who would claim to <em>ignore</em> their customers? But, like the Jeff Bezos quote above - most companies don’t actually walk the walk.</p>",

  "<p>There’s plenty of ways to measure customer satisfaction and customer behavior, but if you can measure them then you’re just being data driven.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s one definition of being customer-centric: the ability to prioritize things that you can’t immediately measure. This is hard! Many businesses are a slave to their data and so one definition of this is that being customer-centric is being able to prioritize things that customers need/want <strong>above and beyond what is measurable</strong>. Because every business does things that are customers need/want - but in the context of being customer-centric it has to go beyond the routine or minimum, or even measurable perspective.</p>",
  "<p>There are plenty of studies that show the benefit of being customer-centric but I think a lot of those uplifts are measured long after the fact.

  "<p>Obviously customer behaviors are changing in all kinds of ways, but one fundamental truth that is radically different in the age of the internet is choice. Not just that customer have more choice than ever (somewhat obvious) but a consequence of this is that <a href=\"https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-playbook/#always-cuddle-with-the-chaos\">buyers look at three times more of your competitors than they used to</a>:</p>",

  "<p>My hunch: customer-centric thinking (and executive leadership) <em>only</em> matters for the least commoditized areas. It’s these areas that require most sensitivity to customer behaviors <em>and</em> that these areas are least likely to have norms and standards to reference in the market.</p>",

  "<p>It seems like customer-centric thinking and hospitality are very similar concepts? Are they the same? Unclear.

  "<h1 id=\"part-2-becoming-customer-centric\">Part 2: Becoming Customer Centric</h1>",
  "<p>Ok, so we’ve taken a view across the landscape and explored what it means to be customer centric a little. But how do you <em>become</em> customer centric? In particular, I think the key idea is not <em>“how do you get an organization to be customer centric?”</em> but rather <em>“how do you get a key executive to become customer centric?”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>There are various guides about <em>organizations</em> becoming customer centric like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/resources/how-to-build-customer-centric-culture/\">this good piece by Survey Monkey</a>:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"https://cdn.smassets.net/assets/content/sm/Bar-charts-that-display-level-of-customer-centricity.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>But something about this makes me feel uneasy - internal satisfaction surveys? It all feels a bit like paying lip service to an idea that needs to be deeply ingrained. A measured approach to something unmeasurable, a tangible approach to something intangible…</p>",
  "<p>My lived experience working with founders, CEOs and executives is that the power is in something more personal. It’s not about a company-wide culture of being customer-centric as much as a singular vision, passion and voice for being customer centric that comes from a key executive that enables customer-centric decision making.</p>",

  "<p>So what might an executive intervention look like? Well, much like a Wardly map is non-confrontational tool to critically discuss strategy, maybe a <strong>customer service map</strong> is a non-confrontational tool to critically discuss customer-centric ideas. Here’s Aibnb’s customer service map (and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1654137863007612930?lang=en\">tweet thread</a>):</p>",

  "<p>Unfortunately, while this Airbnb example feels interesting - if you look around at the literature of customer journey maps you quickly realize that they’re not the right tool for changing an executives perspective…</p>",
  "<p>👟👟👟</p>",
  "<p>When I think about the most successful consulting engagements over the last 10 years, it’s the ones where I could help (in some small way) key executives view the world around them in a different light. To help them become slightly more attuned to the reality of customer experience and to be slightly better at putting themselves in the customer’s shoes.</p>",
  "<p>This rarely happens in a single moment, but rather through a gradual ongoing process of introspection, discussion and surprise. The surprise is key to jolting executives out of their established ways of looking and ways of thinking to consider things anew, to look at things with fresh eyes.</p>",
  "<p>👟👟👟</p>",
  "<p>Let’s wrap this up. I want to keep exploring this idea of customer-centric thinking, so here’s some open questions I have right now:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>What is the distinction between a customer-centric culture and a single customer-centric executive? How are they different and the same? Is it possible for a bottoms-up approach to being customer-centric or can this only happen top down?</li><br />  <li>What are the systemic forces inside an organization that prevent executives from being customer-centric? Why is this a rare skill?</li><br />  <li>What metrics should businesses be measuring around customer experience? In a world where customers look at 3x the competitors they used to, how do you create a customer-first view of the alternatives and options that users have?</li><br />  <li>How might you build a training program like the disney institute designed to create new perspectives for executives, but designed for URL experiences, not IRL experiences?</li><br /></ol>",

A third critical question of internal logic that should be addressed explicitly rather than left to whim and chance is about how <em>personal </em>the business is: to what degree and in what ways the business is <em>for</em> its founders (or <em>for</em> some group of insiders which is meant to grow beyond the founders, as is the case for many partnership firms)?</p><br /><p>There are many things that founders or other key players who have the power to shape a venture’s evolution and to choose whether/how to make the venture meaningfully <em>for</em> them might want. They might aspire to pursue a certain vision of the world or to create wealth, which relate to the points we’ve explored above. They might want to be in charge, or to be able to focus on certain kinds of work they like doing, or to work with particular people whose company they enjoy, or to build their personal brands.</p><br /><p>At one end of a continuum is a business that’s created and fully acknowledged to be a “lifestyle business.” If two brothers want to restore classic cars together, make a certain level of income doing so, and take July and August off, more power to them. Would that every business should be so clear about its commitments.</p><br /><p>The great danger here lies in the middle ground, where the point of the organization isn’t explicitly meant to be the fulfillment of the founders’ vision for their own good lives, but where the personal desires of founders (or other powerful people) in fact shape a range of decisions. The founder who isn’t a strong CEO but who wants to be in charge (perhaps wants to be active in the business and “doesn’t want to have a boss” or perhaps just values being able to call all the shots) not only risks managing poorly, but risks undermining the belief that the organization truly stands for a commitment to something larger than himself. Strong founders and strong leaders make clear that they are accountable to higher goals and to impersonal standards—they create a “government of laws, not men.”</p><br /><footer>@humanenterprise<cite> <a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business\">https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",

  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"On%20Human%20Enterprise%20%7C%20Internal%20Logic%3A%20What%20Is%20Our%20Business%20For%3F\" data-author=\"@humanenterprise\" cite=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business\"><br /><p>Businesses early in their development are often still largely owned and primarily shaped by their founders. A third critical question of internal logic that should be addressed explicitly rather than left to whim and chance is about how <em>personal </em>the business is: to what degree and in what ways the business is <em>for</em> its founders (or <em>for</em> some group of insiders which is meant to grow beyond the founders, as is the case for many partnership firms)?</p><br /><p>There are many things that founders or other key players who have the power to shape a venture’s evolution and to choose whether/how to make the venture meaningfully <em>for</em> them might want. They might aspire to pursue a certain vision of the world or to create wealth, which relate to the points we’ve explored above. They might want to be in charge, or to be able to focus on certain kinds of work they like doing, or to work with particular people whose company they enjoy, or to build their personal brands.</p><br /><p>At one end of a continuum is a business that’s created and fully acknowledged to be a “lifestyle business.” If two brothers want to restore classic cars together, make a certain level of income doing so, and take July and August off, more power to them. Would that every business should be so clear about its commitments.</p><br /><p>The great danger here lies in the middle ground, where the point of the organization isn’t explicitly meant to be the fulfillment of the founders’ vision for their own good lives, but where the personal desires of founders (or other powerful people) in fact shape a range of decisions. The founder who isn’t a strong CEO but who wants to be in charge (perhaps wants to be active in the business and “doesn’t want to have a boss” or perhaps just values being able to call all the shots) not only risks managing poorly, but risks undermining the belief that the organization truly stands for a commitment to something larger than himself. Strong founders and strong leaders make clear that they are accountable to higher goals and to impersonal standards—they create a “government of laws, not men.”</p><br /><footer>@humanenterprise<cite> <a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business\">https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",

  "<p>I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process.

  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-02-09-11-13-02.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p><em>(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)</em></p>",
  "<p>Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).</p>",
  "<p>Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.</p>",
  "<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"giving-advice-is-hard-of-course\">Giving Advice is Hard of Course</h2>",
  "<p>As we know, <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/\">giving advice is tricky</a>. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.</p>",
  "<p>If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…</p>",
  "<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>",
  "<p>Anyway - if you’re a Remarkable user, what are your workflows and setups? I’d love to compare notes!</p><br />"

  "<p>What do I use my Remarkable for? The three R’s - reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>",
  "<p>Core, daily usage:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Taking notes, capturing ideas, jotting down the day’s todo list. All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.</li><br />  <li>Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas. The kind of thing that is hard to do on a notebook because it involves zooming in and out, erasing sections, using straight lines etc.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1754690464156946652\">Reading PDFs</a> (and annotating with notes) - what a perfect form factor for reading PDFs! I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.</li><br />  <li>I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Fun, quirky uses:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful. Roxy and I did that last night as I was helping her understand place value for tens and hundreds.</li><br />  <li>There are various game templates for the Remarkable that you can buy but I prefer to play something like <a href=\"https://athriftymom.com/pencil-wars-drawing-game/\">drawing wars</a> with my kids!</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>And here’s a recent usage that I’m really digging - constructing a custom project tracker for my book writing project:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-02-09-11-09-19.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

  "<p>Here’s some ideas I’d <em>love</em>:</p>",
  "<p>I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process. What if there was a “second screen mode” that could be a combination of live-data and note taking? Something like this:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-02-09-11-13-02.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p><em>(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)</em></p>",
  "<p>Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).</p>",
  "<p>Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.</p>",
  "<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"giving-advice-is-hard-of-course\">Giving Advice is Hard of Course</h2>",
  "<p>As we know, <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/\">giving advice is tricky</a>. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.</p>",
  "<p>If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…</p>",
  "<p>✍️✍️✍️</p>",
  "<p>Anyway - if you’re a Remarkable user, what are your workflows and setups? I’d love to compare notes!</p><br />"

  "<p>What to say about the future of AI and search?</p>",
  "<p>Obviously, we don’t know. But I’m going to jot down a few thoughts.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"clicks-to-websites-will-go-updownsideways\">Clicks to Websites will go up/down/sideways?</h2>",
  "<p>There’s an interesting spectrum of responses to the new “generative search experiences” and what it means for clicks out to websites.</p>",
  "<p>The <strong>super optimistic outlook</strong> says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Generative search &amp; AI is going to absolutely explode the number of search queries per user per day. Just like mobile search and youtube search are largely additive to “regular” search, we’re going to see more search queries than ever and eventually more outbound clicks than ever before”</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>pragmatic positive</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Look, Google’s ads business model relies on showing you links and driving clicks to websites. So however the future interface changes there’s going to be a fundamental notion of links and clicks that will continue to exist. So there will be changes big and small to the number of clicks but ultimately it’s not going to be a “50% decline in all search” scenario”</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>pragmatic pessimist</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Sure, search click curves are going to change - but actually for A LOT of queries you simply don’t need to click out - the query is well served by an LLM model. While many transactional queries will survive, the informational and exploratory queries will be completely re-shaped. This will lead to broad-scale changes across the media landscape in particular.</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>super pessimistic</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“LLMs are going to fundamentally rewrite how people interact with the web to the point that search itself diminishes as a behavior - leading not only to dramatically fewer clicks to websites but even Google’s core ads business model will come under threat.”</em></p>",
  "<p>Whichever outlook you have, I think one thing is becoming obvious - with how fast open source and small local models are getting - I don’t think search is going to be threatened by a membership model (a la $20 / month for chatGPT). I think search is going to remain free and ad supported for some time to come.<sup id=\"fnref:ads\"><a href=\"#fn:ads\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"just-in-time-interfaces\">Just-in-time Interfaces</h2>",
  "<p>There’s another outlook though - maybe the era of search-first is just over? What I mean is this - you could argue that today we <em>start</em> our queries in search (just like we used to start our search in directories many moons ago). Whether it’s voice search, Google search etc we start there.</p>",
  "<p>But you could argue that we’re entering an era where we <em>start</em> our queries with an LLM/assistant interface. Something that results in search <strong><em>some of the time</em></strong> - but NOT all the time. Some times it results in novel, new interfaces - whether it’s a just-in-time UI that is assembled to support your task completion or whether it’s a collaborative document / code environment.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve been playing around with a workflow that goes something like:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Tell GPT what I want to do</li><br />  <li>Ask GPT to think about what interface would enable that task completion</li><br />  <li>Ask GPT to give me the code for that interface</li><br />  <li>Copy and paste that code into Replit</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>This is all quite manual and a little bit slow today - but when it gets it right, the results are magical and truly novel. I could easily imagine a new OpenAI beta playground environment that tried to build interfaces on the fly for you. It’s all there today.</p>",
  "<p>See: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1724990427756200115\">the tldraw experiment that lets you draw a UI and have GPT build a working version</a>.</p>",
  "<p>(Aside: Google search results are essentially adaptive UI designed for the query at this point! I mean look at the custom ecommerce UI all over a standard <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=green+raincoat+for+men\">shopping query</a> these days.)</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"what-new-kinds-of-queries-will-exist\">What new kinds of queries will exist?</h2>",
  "<p>Ok, so if we have a different kind of box to type or talk into - how will this differ from a search box? Well, I think the affordances of natural language will change the kinds of behaviors that we find ourselves familiar with.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s a simple example. People used to search for things with specific location modifiers - think “restaurants in NYC” but as it became obvious and predictable that Google already knows where the query is coming from, we stopped searching for “restaurants in NYC” and started searching for “restaurants near me”.</p>",
  "<p>The “near me” version of queries became the dominant version <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US-NY&amp;q=restaurant%20in%20nyc,restaurant%20near%20me&amp;hl=en\">about 10 years ago</a>.</p>",
  "<p>So the affordances of the search results changes our behavior.</p>",
  "<p>It’s fun to imagine whole new <em>kinds</em> of search queries / questions that you simply wouldn’t type into Google because it wouldn’t make sense. Things like:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><em>Why am I feeling anxious today?</em></li><br />  <li><em>What should I work on today?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Should I take the job offer I was just sent?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Can I afford a holiday this year?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Give me a poem to start my day</em></li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>I’m betting that as we get comfortable talking to LLMs we’ll slowly get comfortable asking more personal, more spiritual, more emotional, more goal-oriented questions and discussions.</p>",
  "<p><em>(Obviously, I’m guessing the real queries of the future will look nothing like this - it’ll be some other weird second order effect that no one anticipated)</em></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"were-going-to-need-new-ideas-for-measurement\">We’re going to need new ideas for measurement</h2>",
  "<p>Two things we’re going to need to invent new ideas around measurement for: <strong>search quality</strong> and <strong>search rankings</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Google hasn’t had any serious competition for <strong>decades</strong> - and so collectively I think we’ve all kind of given up on measuring search quality? Even Google I think has become lazy in how they measure search quality in recent years.</p>",
  "<p>But it’s suddenly a serious question to ask who did it better for a particular category of search.</p>",
  "<p><em>(In 10 minutes I built a little side by side for Google and Perplexity. Play around here: <a href=\"https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/\">https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/</a>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Of course - it’s not quite true that no one is measuring search quality. Daniel S. Griffin has <a href=\"https://danielsgriffin.com/docs/2023/07/05/search-audits/\">a really interesting collection of articles, academic papers and resources around “search audits”</a>. Ok, so I guess we all have some homework to do.</p>",
  "<p>But/and - because the affordances are changing and search behavior is changing we’re still going to need some careful thinking around how we measure the quality of search results.</p>",
  "<p>Meanwhile, in the SEO industry, we’ve been relying on “rank tracking” for a long time (too long?). I’m excited that this new era of generative search experiences might usher in some innovation from the SEO tool providers around how we measure performance in search. It’s needed.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Actually, there’s a third thing we’re going to need to invent new measurement standards for: clicks. AI-assisted clicks. Do they show in analytics? Do bots declare themselves? When a bot browses on your behalf what user-agent does it use? Are bots allowed to fetch URLs on your behalf if they do it locally? Or only via direct user-initiated command?</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-skill-of-searching\">The Skill of Searching</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s another way of thinking about the impact of LLMs.</p>",
  "<p>You know how some people are just better at searching than others? If you’re reading this article you’re probably thinking that you’re <em>good at searching</em>. Maybe your significant other turns to you to help you find the right thing, maybe you feel like you’re competent at weeding through 10 blue links to find the most relevant result. You’re fluent and competent at the internet.</p>",
  "<p>Being good at searching is a combination of query formulation, looking for signs, recognizing trusted sites etc.</p>",
  "<p>Well, studies find that for knowledge worker tasks, LLMs lift the below average people <em>the most</em> and close the gap between top and bottom performers:</p>",

  "<p>So, maybe our model for how search will evolve is instead of imagining your average person searching for a generic query, imagine them being as <strong>good as you are</strong> at searching. How would that change your ideas for the future of search behavior?</p>",
  "<p>After all - maybe you’re the obsessive nerd who opens 15 tabs for every search. Well, everyone can do that now:</p>",

  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"context--persistence\">Context &amp; Persistence</h2>",
  "<p>It’s clear to me that two missing “obvious” ideas from the LLM chat interfaces we have today are context and persistence.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Context</strong> - because although you can write your own custom GPTs and so on, today even Bard doesn’t have access to your calendar, your email and your chats. Surely the eventual assistant will have much more awareness of who you are, what you’re working on, where you are etc. This is part of the bull case for Apple/Google dominance in the AI era.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Persistence</strong> - why can’t I ask GPT to remind me next month about something? Or to notify when some future thing happens? This feels like Google Alerts (or Yahoo Pipes) on steroids and it’s simply a quirk of the technology today that they don’t do this. I think before the year is out GPT will have a way of sending you alerts, notifications and reminders.</p>",
  "<p>My friends at Addition are building a kind of LLM-powered Google Alerts here in early beta: <a href=\"https://insightly.co/\">Insightly</a></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Of course - the future will be agents, doing tasks with you and for you. Acting on your behalf. I think we’re a little ways off from that happening for anything beyond basic tasks today - but it’ll come, and when it does we’ll need new paradigms for all kinds of things.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"publishers--poisoned-wells\">Publishers &amp; Poisoned Wells</h2>",
  "<p>Do you remember the poisoned well argument around Google AMP? Basically publishers hated Google AMP because it broke the rules of the web - Google acting like a hosted intermediary between Google and publishers. But of course Google argued that if publishers didn’t have such shitty websites covered in ads and bloat and crap, AMP wouldn’t be needed.</p>",
  "<p>Well.</p>",
  "<p>I think we’re going to see a <em>very</em> similar story play out with Google vs publishers. The publishers right now are up in arms that Google could use LLMs to answer queries, thus reducing clicks to the “open web”. And yet - in conversations I’m having with publishers and brands behind the scenes, companies are desperate for traffic and many are planning for large-scale deployment of AI-written content.</p>",
  "<p>Honestly - I’m not sure this is a bad thing! There’s a lot of very terrible human-written content out there.</p>",
  "<p>But of course this is going to trigger a bit of an arms race where Google points to all the AI-generated bloat and spam from publishers as an excuse for introducing their AI experiences.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",

  "<p>Maybe the future is indexable experiences.</p>",
  "<p>No, I don’t care to explain myself.</p>",
  "<p>Ok alright, well I think most <em>content</em> that brands create should actually be an <em>experience</em>. A little web-app that helps you. For example for a query like “how to get slime out of carpet”<sup id=\"fnref:slime\"><a href=\"#fn:slime\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> - I don’t want an article with 1000 words of SEO-focused garbage with the history of slime, headers answering all the “FAQs” like “what is slime”.</p>",
  "<p>What I want is a little slime helper that says “what kind of slime is it? how long has it been there? do you have vinegar?” then gives me some help to guide me through.</p>",
  "<p>I mean, what I <em>really</em> want is to yell at my kids. Maybe an LLM can help me parent better in the future. Maybe an LLM can stop my kids putting slime on the carpet in the future. See above: new kinds of queries.</p>",

Their reliance on humans to create chum for the algorithm may be temporary as AI and machine-generated content are now easier to create.</p><br /><p>As a creator, journalist, or brand, you can no longer reliably pour money or labor into a platform and have it reliably return an audience that you can turn into customers. As a result, audience growth has slowed across the board.</p><br /><footer>@seanblanda<cite> <a href=\"https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/\">https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>I’ve seen personally how much this lack of predictability has paralyzed client budgets. Most companies are not very good at operating in uncertainty. (I’m guessing <a href=\"https://uncertaintymindset.org/\">Vaughn Tan</a> is very much in demand right now).</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Some default recommendations that I’m using with clients I work with:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Put AI in the loop for content creation today, but be very thoughtful in creating AI content without humans in the loop.</li><br />  <li>I’m more interested in AI-generated experiences than I am AI-generated content. AI-generated experiences can start very simply but are surprisingly scaleable. Remember that intent / information gain / task completion is always the goal.</li><br />  <li>Developing AI capabilities is more important than knowing exactly where it shows up or how you’ll use it. This typically means starting with a small pilot, and carefully talking about it and sharing it internally.</li><br />  <li>CRM is a huge opportunity for AI (though I suppose CRM was always a huge opportunity - but it was neglected even before AI).</li><br />  <li>Now is a <em>great</em> time to carefully consider the question of “quality content” and “quality experiences” - for a long time companies operated without a strong definition or measurement of quality. “Humans made it” was a proxy for “it’s good” but now we need new benchmarks and metrics for what “good”. We need that before we can start using AI.</li><br />  <li>Yes, once you have a clear understanding of “quality” an LLM can be very useful in quality control.</li><br /></ol>",

  "<p>What to say about the future of AI and search?</p>",
  "<p>Obviously, we don’t know. But I’m going to jot down a few thoughts.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"clicks-to-websites-will-go-updownsideways\">Clicks to Websites will go up/down/sideways?</h2>",
  "<p>There’s an interesting spectrum of responses to the new “generative search experiences” and what it means for clicks out to websites.</p>",
  "<p>The <strong>super optimistic outlook</strong> says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Generative search &amp; AI is going to absolutely explode the number of search queries per user per day. Just like mobile search and youtube search are largely additive to “regular” search, we’re going to see more search queries than ever and eventually more outbound clicks than ever before”</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>pragmatic positive</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Look, Google’s ads business model relies on showing you links and driving clicks to websites. So however the future interface changes there’s going to be a fundamental notion of links and clicks that will continue to exist. So there will be changes big and small to the number of clicks but ultimately it’s not going to be a “50% decline in all search” scenario”</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>pragmatic pessimist</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Sure, search click curves are going to change - but actually for A LOT of queries you simply don’t need to click out - the query is well served by an LLM model. While many transactional queries will survive, the informational and exploratory queries will be completely re-shaped. This will lead to broad-scale changes across the media landscape in particular.</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>super pessimistic</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“LLMs are going to fundamentally rewrite how people interact with the web to the point that search itself diminishes as a behavior - leading not only to dramatically fewer clicks to websites but even Google’s core ads business model will come under threat.”</em></p>",
  "<p>Whichever outlook you have, I think one thing is becoming obvious - with how fast open source and small local models are getting - I don’t think search is going to be threatened by a membership model (a la $20 / month for chatGPT). I think search is going to remain free and ad supported for some time to come.<sup id=\"fnref:ads\"><a href=\"#fn:ads\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"just-in-time-interfaces\">Just-in-time Interfaces</h2>",
  "<p>There’s another outlook though - maybe the era of search-first is just over? What I mean is this - you could argue that today we <em>start</em> our queries in search (just like we used to start our search in directories many moons ago). Whether it’s voice search, Google search etc we start there.</p>",
  "<p>But you could argue that we’re entering an era where we <em>start</em> our queries with an LLM/assistant interface. Something that results in search <strong><em>some of the time</em></strong> - but NOT all the time. Some times it results in novel, new interfaces - whether it’s a just-in-time UI that is assembled to support your task completion or whether it’s a collaborative document / code environment.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve been playing around with a workflow that goes something like:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Tell GPT what I want to do</li><br />  <li>Ask GPT to think about what interface would enable that task completion</li><br />  <li>Ask GPT to give me the code for that interface</li><br />  <li>Copy and paste that code into Replit</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>This is all quite manual and a little bit slow today - but when it gets it right, the results are magical and truly novel. I could easily imagine a new OpenAI beta playground environment that tried to build interfaces on the fly for you. It’s all there today.</p>",
  "<p>See: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1724990427756200115\">the tldraw experiment that lets you draw a UI and have GPT build a working version</a>.</p>",
  "<p>(Aside: Google search results are essentially adaptive UI designed for the query at this point! I mean look at the custom ecommerce UI all over a standard <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=green+raincoat+for+men\">shopping query</a> these days.)</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"what-new-kinds-of-queries-will-exist\">What new kinds of queries will exist?</h2>",
  "<p>Ok, so if we have a different kind of box to type or talk into - how will this differ from a search box? Well, I think the affordances of natural language will change the kinds of behaviors that we find ourselves familiar with.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s a simple example. People used to search for things with specific location modifiers - think “restaurants in NYC” but as it became obvious and predictable that Google already knows where the query is coming from, we stopped searching for “restaurants in NYC” and started searching for “restaurants near me”.</p>",
  "<p>The “near me” version of queries became the dominant version <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US-NY&amp;q=restaurant%20in%20nyc,restaurant%20near%20me&amp;hl=en\">about 10 years ago</a>.</p>",
  "<p>So the affordances of the search results changes our behavior.</p>",
  "<p>It’s fun to imagine whole new <em>kinds</em> of search queries / questions that you simply wouldn’t type into Google because it wouldn’t make sense. Things like:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><em>Why am I feeling anxious today?</em></li><br />  <li><em>What should I work on today?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Should I take the job offer I was just sent?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Can I afford a holiday this year?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Give me a poem to start my day</em></li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>I’m betting that as we get comfortable talking to LLMs we’ll slowly get comfortable asking more personal, more spiritual, more emotional, more goal-oriented questions and discussions.</p>",
  "<p><em>(Obviously, I’m guessing the real queries of the future will look nothing like this - it’ll be some other weird second order effect that no one anticipated)</em></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"were-going-to-need-new-ideas-for-measurement\">We’re going to need new ideas for measurement</h2>",
  "<p>Two things we’re going to need to invent new ideas around measurement for: <strong>search quality</strong> and <strong>search rankings</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Google hasn’t had any serious competition for <strong>decades</strong> - and so collectively I think we’ve all kind of given up on measuring search quality? Even Google I think has become lazy in how they measure search quality in recent years.</p>",
  "<p>But it’s suddenly a serious question to ask who did it better for a particular category of search.</p>",
  "<p><em>(In 10 minutes I built a little side by side for Google and Perplexity. Play around here: <a href=\"https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/\">https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/</a>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Of course - it’s not quite true that no one is measuring search quality. Daniel S. Griffin has <a href=\"https://danielsgriffin.com/docs/2023/07/05/search-audits/\">a really interesting collection of articles, academic papers and resources around “search audits”</a>. Ok, so I guess we all have some homework to do.</p>",
  "<p>But/and - because the affordances are changing and search behavior is changing we’re still going to need some careful thinking around how we measure the quality of search results.</p>",
  "<p>Meanwhile, in the SEO industry, we’ve been relying on “rank tracking” for a long time (too long?). I’m excited that this new era of generative search experiences might usher in some innovation from the SEO tool providers around how we measure performance in search. It’s needed.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Actually, there’s a third thing we’re going to need to invent new measurement standards for: clicks. AI-assisted clicks. Do they show in analytics? Do bots declare themselves? When a bot browses on your behalf what user-agent does it use? Are bots allowed to fetch URLs on your behalf if they do it locally? Or only via direct user-initiated command?</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-skill-of-searching\">The Skill of Searching</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s another way of thinking about the impact of LLMs.</p>",
  "<p>You know how some people are just better at searching than others? If you’re reading this article you’re probably thinking that you’re <em>good at searching</em>. Maybe your significant other turns to you to help you find the right thing, maybe you feel like you’re competent at weeding through 10 blue links to find the most relevant result. You’re fluent and competent at the internet.</p>",
  "<p>Being good at searching is a combination of query formulation, looking for signs, recognizing trusted sites etc.</p>",
  "<p>Well, studies find that for knowledge worker tasks, LLMs lift the below average people <em>the most</em> and close the gap between top and bottom performers:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Everyone%20is%20above%20average\" data-author=\"Ethan Mollick\" cite=\"https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/everyone-is-above-average?publication_id=1180644&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;r=k\"><br /><p>Across a set of 18 tasks designed to test a range of business skills - from analysis to idea generation to persuasion - consultants who had previously tested in the lower half of the group increased the quality of their outputs by 43% with AI help while the top half only gained 17%.

  "<p>So, maybe our model for how search will evolve is instead of imagining your average person searching for a generic query, imagine them being as <strong>good as you are</strong> at searching. How would that change your ideas for the future of search behavior?</p>",
  "<p>After all - maybe you’re the obsessive nerd who opens 15 tabs for every search. Well, everyone can do that now:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-31-09-11-23.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"context--persistence\">Context &amp; Persistence</h2>",
  "<p>It’s clear to me that two missing “obvious” ideas from the LLM chat interfaces we have today are context and persistence.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Context</strong> - because although you can write your own custom GPTs and so on, today even Bard doesn’t have access to your calendar, your email and your chats. Surely the eventual assistant will have much more awareness of who you are, what you’re working on, where you are etc. This is part of the bull case for Apple/Google dominance in the AI era.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Persistence</strong> - why can’t I ask GPT to remind me next month about something? Or to notify when some future thing happens? This feels like Google Alerts (or Yahoo Pipes) on steroids and it’s simply a quirk of the technology today that they don’t do this. I think before the year is out GPT will have a way of sending you alerts, notifications and reminders.</p>",
  "<p>My friends at Addition are building a kind of LLM-powered Google Alerts here in early beta: <a href=\"https://insightly.co/\">Insightly</a></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Of course - the future will be agents, doing tasks with you and for you. Acting on your behalf. I think we’re a little ways off from that happening for anything beyond basic tasks today - but it’ll come, and when it does we’ll need new paradigms for all kinds of things.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"publishers--poisoned-wells\">Publishers &amp; Poisoned Wells</h2>",
  "<p>Do you remember the poisoned well argument around Google AMP? Basically publishers hated Google AMP because it broke the rules of the web - Google acting like a hosted intermediary between Google and publishers. But of course Google argued that if publishers didn’t have such shitty websites covered in ads and bloat and crap, AMP wouldn’t be needed.</p>",
  "<p>Well.</p>",
  "<p>I think we’re going to see a <em>very</em> similar story play out with Google vs publishers. The publishers right now are up in arms that Google could use LLMs to answer queries, thus reducing clicks to the “open web”. And yet - in conversations I’m having with publishers and brands behind the scenes, companies are desperate for traffic and many are planning for large-scale deployment of AI-written content.</p>",
  "<p>Honestly - I’m not sure this is a bad thing! There’s a lot of very terrible human-written content out there.</p>",
  "<p>But of course this is going to trigger a bit of an arms race where Google points to all the AI-generated bloat and spam from publishers as an excuse for introducing their AI experiences.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Here’s one idea - everyone is focused on generating indexable content for Google to consume and rank.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe the future is indexable experiences.</p>",
  "<p>No, I don’t care to explain myself.</p>",
  "<p>Ok alright, well I think most <em>content</em> that brands create should actually be an <em>experience</em>. A little web-app that helps you. For example for a query like “how to get slime out of carpet”<sup id=\"fnref:slime\"><a href=\"#fn:slime\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> - I don’t want an article with 1000 words of SEO-focused garbage with the history of slime, headers answering all the “FAQs” like “what is slime”.</p>",
  "<p>What I want is a little slime helper that says “what kind of slime is it? how long has it been there? do you have vinegar?” then gives me some help to guide me through.</p>",
  "<p>I mean, what I <em>really</em> want is to yell at my kids. Maybe an LLM can help me parent better in the future. Maybe an LLM can stop my kids putting slime on the carpet in the future. See above: new kinds of queries.</p>",
  "<p>No, I don’t know how “indexable experiences” will work. Do you?</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-only-certain-thing-is-uncertainty\">The only certain thing is uncertainty</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s a nice analogy from Sean Blanda around how the fundamental predictability of platforms has changed:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"What's%20About%20to%20Happen%20(to%20Content%2C%20Journalism%2C%20and%20Comms)\" data-author=\"@seanblanda\" cite=\"https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/\"><br /><p>Much like stable national business and predictable tax policy attract investment, stable internet platforms attract makers and creators. I'm more willing to build my audience on your service if I can expect a reasonable amount of stability and predictability. For more than a decade, Google, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn had stable rules and incentives. </p><br /><p>However, thanks to a mix of AI and changing market conditions, each of these platforms is now antagonistic to linking to outside sources. Their reliance on humans to create chum for the algorithm may be temporary as AI and machine-generated content are now easier to create.</p><br /><p>As a creator, journalist, or brand, you can no longer reliably pour money or labor into a platform and have it reliably return an audience that you can turn into customers. As a result, audience growth has slowed across the board.</p><br /><footer>@seanblanda<cite> <a href=\"https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/\">https://www.seanblanda.com/whats-about-to-happen/</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>I’ve seen personally how much this lack of predictability has paralyzed client budgets. Most companies are not very good at operating in uncertainty. (I’m guessing <a href=\"https://uncertaintymindset.org/\">Vaughn Tan</a> is very much in demand right now).</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Some default recommendations that I’m using with clients I work with:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Put AI in the loop for content creation today, but be very thoughtful in creating AI content without humans in the loop.</li><br />  <li>I’m more interested in AI-generated experiences than I am AI-generated content. AI-generated experiences can start very simply but are surprisingly scaleable. Remember that intent / information gain / task completion is always the goal.</li><br />  <li>Developing AI capabilities is more important than knowing exactly where it shows up or how you’ll use it. This typically means starting with a small pilot, and carefully talking about it and sharing it internally.</li><br />  <li>CRM is a huge opportunity for AI (though I suppose CRM was always a huge opportunity - but it was neglected even before AI).</li><br />  <li>Now is a <em>great</em> time to carefully consider the question of “quality content” and “quality experiences” - for a long time companies operated without a strong definition or measurement of quality. “Humans made it” was a proxy for “it’s good” but now we need new benchmarks and metrics for what “good”. We need that before we can start using AI.</li><br />  <li>Yes, once you have a clear understanding of “quality” an LLM can be very useful in quality control.</li><br /></ol>",

  "<p>Beep boop. What are you thinking about?</p>",

  "<p><em>Update from a cold room later that same day, Jan 31st:</em> Jared Hecht has a nice little riff on <a href=\"https://paragraph.xyz/@jaredhecht/agent-native-applications\">agent native applications</a> that provokes the question of whether web3 enters the chat. This piece helped me think a bit more deeply about the role of aggregators, data layers and protocols as it relates to search.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s an interesting perspective. For a keyword like “best laptop”, Google could <em>already</em> remove the middle-man of publishers regurgitating 4,000 comparison pieces.

  "<blockquote><br />  <p><em>“It is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor’s job is to be helpful.” David Maister - The Trusted Advisor</em></p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p><em>“I can DO IT!”</em> my 7 year old screams at me. She asked for help with her homework, but now - half way through explaining the place value of numbers - she had enough of my help and was physically and emotionally pushing me away - <em>“I can DO IT already”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Of course, she proceeded to not be able to do it.</p>",
  "<p><em>“Yes I know that!”</em> I shouted in exasperation. I was making pancakes for the kids and had only skim-read the recipe. As a result I had forgotten to melt the butter before adding it to the mixture and it was all lumpy. My partner Erin looked over and said <em>“you should have melted the butter before you put it in, would you like me to give you a recipe?”</em>. I had a recipe, but obviously I hadn’t followed it and knew that I had made a mistake. <em>“I KNOW I should have melted the butter, that’s not helpful to me right now!”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is emotionally fraught and complicated. It’s true for 7 year olds, it’s true for me and it’s true for my clients.</p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is an intensely personal thing. The feeling of learning something new sits right next to the feeling of shame for not knowing it in the first place. And worse, in the client/consultant relationship, the client is at least partially complicit in the situation when they come to you.</p>",
  "<p>So, some of the things that might seem “obvious” to you as a consultant can actually be incredibly delicate and problematic. Consider:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Quickly pointing out potential problems with the situation</li><br />  <li>Immediately offering a solution to these problems</li><br />  <li>Stating that things are easily solved</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>You do these things because you want to be seen as an expert, you want to reassure the client that you have the answer and that the client is in good hands.</p>",
  "<p>But think carefully about how these things make the client feel. They can make the client feel stupid, it can place a fair share of blame on the client for the situation and it can make them feel like you didn’t listen carefully enough to their description of the problem before leaping to solutions.</p>",
  "<p>So in this chapter we’re going to look at ways to <strong>resist the urge to add immediate value</strong>. Instead we have to hold space for a more vulnerable, honest and open relationship with our client - to allow them to open up more fully and to work on things that are useful, even if not in scope.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"from-consultant-to-advisor\">From Consultant to Advisor</h2>",
  "<p>In the book Trusted Advisor by David Maister (highly recommended!) there is a a nice illustration that shows the evolution of client/consultant relationships as you get more senior and more strategic:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/advice.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is fraught even if the problem is well defined and you <em>do</em> know the answer. So when you’re working on strategic, ill-defined projects where there isn’t a <em>right</em> answer - giving advice is incredibly delicate, and in some cases not even possible.</p>",
  "<p>Eventually in your career you might even stop thinking of yourself as a consultant and start thinking of yourself as an advisor.</p>",
  "<p>And as we see in the diagram - <strong>in order to get access to the deeper emotional layers of advice giving and receiving we need to formulate a close relationship with our clients</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>While giving advice can help you be seen as knowledgeable, it doesn’t necessarily build trust.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"you-should-is-a-dangerous-phrase\">“You should…” is a dangerous phrase</h2>",
  "<p>One of the biggest mistakes a consultant can make is to think that you’re there to give advice and solve client problems. It’s so easy to let this little phrase creep into your work:</p>",
  "<p><em>“You should…”</em></p>",
  "<p>It’s a simple sounding phrase but it gets you in trouble more often than not. It’s problematic for two reasons: it assumes a control of client resources and it’s too prescriptive in form:</p>",

  "<p>It’s a fundamental mistake to assume that as a consultant we can allocate client resources.

  "<p>Barging into a client saying that they should do something implies a kind of confidence and bravado that can be arrogant at best and ignorant at worst.</p>",
  "<p>Think about the last time you saw a project through from start to finish - the range of complexities, dependencies, hurdles, different work streams and so on required to get it over the finish line are almost certainly missing from the overly-confident and overly-simplistic “You should…”</p>",
  "<p>The simple way that this phrase goes wrong is by under-estimating the <strong>resource complexity</strong> of a task:</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: working with a client where I wanted to re-design a landing page on their site to improve it. Unfortunately I was under-estimating the number of people who need to be involved since the landing pages were still owned by the product team and are technically part of the same codebase as the full tech product. So a “small” change required detailed security scrutiny and QA before going live. Making “simple” changes was not in fact simple at all here.</p><br /></div>",

  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: working with the NYTimes cooking team I suggested that they should re-tag their content. This kind of “you should…” recommendation seemed straightforward but neglected the political considerations - the team had just spent 6-figures on re-tagging all their recipes - so to ask for further budget to re-do a task they had just done would lose them face internally. A “straightforward” change that actually carried a bunch of political baggage.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Some other types of complexity that you might be under-estimating with regards resource allocation:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>Regulation/compliance complexity</strong> - which either prevents you even doing your recommendation or makes it slower.</li><br />  <li><strong>Technical complexity</strong> - while something might be technically easy, doing it with the client’s existing technology might be hard.</li><br />  <li><strong>Data complexity</strong> - a simple seeming request on the surface (make a landing page for every neighborhood) might actually depend on a robust, maintained data set that doesn’t yet exist.</li><br />  <li><strong>Maintenance complexity</strong> - even if the initial request to create something or do something is not resource intensive, it might come with an implicit agreement to continue to maintain it - expanding the resources allocated.</li><br />  <li><strong>Production complexity</strong> - where what you’re proposing isn’t that expensive or resource intensive to do, but the client (for whatever reason) has a higher quality threshold, making the recommendation more expensive/slower/harder than you anticipated.</li><br />  <li><strong>Narrative complexity</strong> - where what you’re recommending seems reasonable but either the company has tried it before, or a competitor has tried it before or there’s a general sense that “this doesn’t work”. Which can make your recommendation extremely hard to actually get done.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h3 id=\"2-you-should-is-too-prescriptive-in-form\">2. “You should…” is too prescriptive in form</h3>",
  "<p>In addition to under-estimating the problem, we also over-fit the solution. After all, as we saw in the chapter <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/\">The Consultant’s Grain</a>, as independent consultants we often bias towards our own natural strengths and areas of expertise.</p>",
  "<p>When we say <em>“You should…”</em> we’re essentially offering a problem diagnosis AND a solution at the same time. The consequence of this is that we’re essentially asking the client to accept or reject both together.</p>",
  "<p>Instead, most of your work would be more effective at actually changing clients if you stopped to clearly separate the diagnosis from the solution. If you don’t properly win over all the necessary stakeholders at the client’s side you’re going to face resistance trying to get anything done.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: I was working with Gartner Digital Markets on some SEO strategy and I felt that we needed to work on some more transformative work than simple technical SEO fixes - their core landing pages were offering a worse user experience than the competition and we were losing ground.</p>",
  "  <p>Persuading the rest of the organization that this was a problem wasn’t straightforward. We’d been saying that these pages needed overhauling and it felt like no one was listening. So we ran a small user survey to ask a series of 10 “Google quality rater questions”. This allowed us to present our findings to the senior leadership team at Gartner and I remember showing something like this:</p>",
  "  <p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-19-16-04-03.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "  <p>Instantly, people leaned in around the table and there was a lot of executive interest. Saying something like “we should improve our pages” is too bland and generic - it only serves to win over people who already agree with you. It lacks any kind of rigor or weight to win someone over who already has their own opinions and roadmap.</p>",
  "  <p>In this situation - the survey allowed us to <em>quantify</em> the problem correctly and provided compelling evidence, we didn’t even need to offer a solution! Articulating the problem was enough to convince the necessary teams to take action and prioritize work.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>So if you’re asking <em>“You should…”</em> to the client, stop and examine if you’ve properly defined the situation and provided evidence for the problem, to help the client deeply internalize the problem and win over the necessary stakeholders before you propose any kind of solution.</p>",
  "<p>A good mental exercise to ensure you’re doing the work here is to ask yourself: what happens if the client takes no action? What is the consequence of the current trajectory, or the null case of no investment? This will help you bring some rigor to the question of what the consequence of the problem truly is and allow the problem to be quantified relative to other projects and investment opportunities.</p>",
  "<p>So, what’s the alternative?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"there-is-an-opportunity-to\">“There is an opportunity to…”</h2>",
  "<p>This phrase is the key - it places the focus correctly on first defining the problem - and then providing evidence - before focusing on the solution. It allows us to articulate and quantify the opportunity while leaving room for the client to have say over resource allocation, for the client to shape the solution and for the client to determine prioritization and timing.</p>",
  "<p>Of course in reality, you’re often involved in shaping the solution too - but it’s crucial to ensure that you’re not skipping over the step of clearly defining the size and shape of the opportunity before getting to the solution.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: Working with an ecommerce site to define an SEO strategy part of my recommendation involved investing in content strategy to drive links, traffic and conversions - but before even getting into the shape of the solution, i.e. <em>how</em> we would invest in content it’s important to articulate what the opportunity is.</p>",
  "  <p>By looking at relevant competitors we can estimate the potential traffic and revenue opportunity:</p>",
  "  <p><img src=\"/images/advice-quantified.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "  <p>By showing what’s possible, clients are able to feel more invested in designing the solution with you, rather than just being told what to do.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>This can also be uncomfortable! There are many situations where quantifying the exact opportunity is difficult, requires estimation or requires a different approach (like we saw with the Gartner surveys).</p>",
  "<p>But consider the alternative - the alternative is recommending something to the client… because we say so?</p>",
  "<p>This isn’t necessarily wrong - there’s value in expert opinion - but in my experience clients deeply appreciate you clearly separating out expert opinion and judgment from evidence-based analysis.</p>",
  "<p>As David Maister says in the Trusted Advisor - the best approach is:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>A good process for the advisor to follow is:</p>",
  "  <ol><br />    <li>Give them their options</li><br />    <li>Give them an education about their options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth)</li><br />    <li>Give them a recommendation</li><br />    <li>Let them choose</li><br />  </ol><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This stance essentially allows you as the consultant to own the diagnosis and quantification of the opportunity and then collaboratively with the client to shape the solution and prioritization.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"lets-look-at-the-problem-together\">Let’s look at the problem together</h2>",
  "<p>Taking a collaborative stance with your client is powerful. There are many aspects of consulting that are almost combative by nature - like pointing out problems the client has (that the client was complicit in creating!).</p>",
  "<p>As we saw in the chapter <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/\">Optimism as an Operating System</a>, walking into a client with a critical eye can create a distance between you and the client.</p>",
  "<p>Instead you want to create a kind of shoulder-to-shoulder stance with the client, facing towards the problems together. This creates a much safer, judgment free way to look at the problems (and opportunities) facing the client.</p>",
  "<p>In fact, for senior executives - sometimes you really <em>can’t</em> give them advice - they’re too type-A and overly confident. The only way to convince them is to help them see the problem in a new light - to see things as you see them.</p>",
  "<p>This idea is demonstrated beautifully by Timothy Gallway in The Inner Game of Tennis where he recounts teaching a senior executive how to improve their backhand:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>One day in the summer of 1971 when I was teaching a group of men at John Gardiner’s Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, a businessman realized how much more power and control he got on his backhand when his racket was taken back below the level of the ball. He was so enthusiastic about his “new” stroke that he rushed to tell his friend Jack about it as if some kind of miracle had occurred. Jack, who considered his erratic backhand one of the major problems of his life, came rushing up to me during the lunch hour, exclaiming, “I’ve always had a terrible backhand. Maybe you can help me.”</p>",
  "  <p>I asked, “What’s so terrible about your backhand?”</p>",
  "  <p>“I take my racket back too high on my backswing.”</p>",
  "  <p>“How do you know?”</p>",
  "  <p>“Because at least five different pros have told me so. I just haven’t been able to correct it.”</p>",
  "  <p>For a brief moment I was aware of the absurdity of the situation. Here was a business executive who controlled large commercial enterprises of great complexity asking me for help as if he had no control over his own right arm. Why wouldn’t it be possible, I wondered, to give him the simple reply, “Sure, I can help you. L-o-w-e-r y-o-u-r r-a-c-k-e-t!”</p>",
  "  <p>But complaints such as Jack’s are common among people of all levels of intelligence and proficiency. Besides, it was clear that at least five other pros had told him to lower his racket without much effect. What was keeping him from doing it? I wondered.</p>",
  "  <p>I asked Jack to take a few swings on the patio where we were standing. His backswing started back very low, but then, sure enough, just before swinging forward it lifted to the level of his shoulder and swung down into the imagined ball. The five pros were right. I asked him to swing several more times without making any comment. “Isn’t that better?” he asked. “I tried to keep it low.” But each time just before swinging forward, his racket lifted; it was obvious that had he been hitting an actual ball, the underspin imparted by the downward swing would have caused it to sail out. “Your backhand is all right,” I said reassuringly. “It’s just going through some changes. Why don’t you take a closer look at it.” We walked over to a large windowpane and there I asked him to swing again while watching his reflection. He did so, again taking his characteristic hitch at the back of his swing, but this time he was astounded. “Hey, I really do take my racket back high! It goes up above my shoulder!” There was no judgment in his voice; he was just reporting with amazement what his eyes had seen.</p>",
  "  <p>What surprised me was Jack’s surprise. Hadn’t he said that five pros had told him his racket was too high? I was certain that if I had told him the same thing after his first swing, he would have replied, “Yes, I know.” But what was now clear was that he didn’t really know, since no one is ever surprised at seeing something they already know. Despite all those lessons, he had never directly experienced his racket going back high. His mind had been so absorbed in the process of judgment and trying to change this “bad” stroke that he had never perceived the stroke itself.</p>",
  "  <p>Looking in the glass which mirrored his stroke as it was, Jack was able to keep his racket low quite effortlessly as he swung again. “That feels entirely different than any backhand I’ve ever swung,” he declared. By now he was swinging up and through the ball over and over again. Interestingly, he wasn’t congratulating himself for doing it right; he was simply absorbed in how different it felt.</p>",
  "  <p>After lunch I threw Jack a few balls and he was able to remember how the stroke felt and to repeat the action. This time he just felt where his racket was going, letting his sense of feel replace the visual image offered by the mirror. It was a new experience for him. Soon he was consistently hitting topspin backhands into the court with an effortlessness that made it appear this was his natural swing. In ten minutes he was feeling “in the groove,” and he paused to express his gratitude. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you’ve done for me. I’ve learned more in ten minutes from you than in twenty hours of lessons I’ve taken on my backhand.” I could feel something inside me begin to puff up as it absorbed these “good” words. At the same time, I didn’t know quite how to handle this lavish compliment, and found myself hemming and hawing, trying to come up with an appropriately modest reply. Then, for a moment, my mind turned off and I realized that I hadn’t given Jack a single instruction on his backhand! “But what did I teach you?” I asked. He was quiet for a full half-minute, trying to remember what I had told him. Finally he said, “I can’t remember your telling me anything! You were just there watching, and you got me watching myself closer than I ever had before. Instead of seeing what was wrong with my backhand, I just started observing, and improvement seemed to happen on its own. I’m not sure why, but I certainly learned a lot in a short period of time.” He had learned, but had he been “taught”?</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This is about tennis (is it?) but equally applies to consulting! I find in my own work that senior executives are often blocked by some inability to see what’s actually going on - and that telling them is useless! Instead you need to help them see it for themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Because of their distance from the day to day work, senior executives are especially prone to replacing some version of reality with a compressed narrative. And when this compressed narrative is wrong in some key way you need to return to first principles to show them (not tell them!).</p>",
  "<p>Much like we saw with the example of the Gartner surveys - helping clients see with fresh eyes what’s really going is powerful and can be profoundly useful before you even begin suggesting solutions.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"understanding-the-problem-in-all-of-its-emotional-and-political-complexity\">Understanding the problem in all of its emotional and political complexity</h2>",
  "<p>Once you adopt this collaborative stance with the client you begin to see that the problems as you thought you understood them, are not in fact the full picture.</p>",
  "<p>Your sense of “what’s going on” with a client is intermediated by your point of contact and it turns out that your client is an unreliable narrator. Remember - best case they have problems they’ve been unable to solve on their own, worst case they were actively responsible for creating the problems in the first place!</p>",
  "<p>So it’s no wonder that clients often down-play, mis-represent and mask the full emotional and political complexity of what’s going on. Especially when you first start working together and haven’t yet earned their trust.</p>",
  "<p>But for you to do your job it’s crucial that you get a full picture of what’s really going on. And further, clients deeply appreciate a consultant that can listen and observe closely enough to see what’s really going on.</p>",
  "<p>As David Maister says in <a href=\"https://davidmaister.com/articles/the-consultants-role/\">The Consultant’s Role</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“It can be unsettling to find that the client is primarily interested in having his or her problem understood, in all its emotional and political complexity, as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>What this is saying is that you need to earn the client’s trust in order to be effective at your job. This isn’t at all obvious! When a client comes to you asking for a “content strategy” or support “hiring a VP marketing” it all seems so straightforward, rational and well defined. But as you unpack the layers of the onion you begin to realize why it’s been so hard for the client to help themselves. And that’s when the emotional and political complexity of the problem starts to come into view.</p>",
  "<p>Developing a sensitivity to the emotional and political context of client problems requires an active listening and sensing instinct on behalf of the consultant - to use your own lived experience inside the client’s organization as a way to sense what the inner work life is like inside your client’s business. As Ruth Orenstein says in her book <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Multidimensional_Executive_Coaching/FVHnN1-O-rQC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Multidimensional Executive Coaching</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>For the time he/she is present, the consultant becomes part of the multidimensional system, both influencing it and being influenced by it. To do the work of executive coach- ing, then, the consultant must be able to tolerate, and ultimately make use of, entering a highly complex place-a place that is occupied by neither the individual nor the organization alone but, because of their convergence, both the individual and the organization together; a place that contains both the exigencies of working life and the impulses of the psyche; and a place that engages and, in turn, is engaged by the consultant’s own intrapsychic material. In addition, if the work is done effectively, it requires that the consultant be both involved enough in the dynamics so as to experience their impact and detached enough so as to analyze what is transpiring. These demands make imperative the use of oneself as tool.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>Remember: when clients first come to you, your first instinct might be to dismiss the problem as “easily solved”. But you need to hold space to truly consider that the thing that seems easy is, in this particular situation, with this particular client actually not at all easy. And that’s when the work begins.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-next-most-useful-thing\">The Next Most Useful Thing</h2>",
  "<p>This all builds up to my personal consulting mantra: always work on the next most useful thing.</p>",
  "<p>This mantra helps remind me that consulting isn’t about being right, it’s about being useful.</p>",
  "<p>As a consultant - it’s crucial that you’re generating momentum, that clients can <em>feel a sense of progress in your work</em>. A consultant is typically an expensive investment and without a sense of progress or momentum your engagement will stall out.</p>",
  "<p>Importantly however, a sense of progress and momentum doesn’t have to come from the official SOW or project plan. Actual progress is one thing - but a <em>sense of progress</em> is just that - it’s about your client feeling like things are moving forward.</p>",
  "<p>In fact, depending on the project and the client - moving at the expected pace can be too slow! Even after agreeing on a scope, project plan and set of next steps, moving as fast as you said you would can be disappointing to the client.</p>",
  "<p>Remember - building a great client relationship is about trust. And doing the minimum doesn’t build trust. So it’s important to demonstrate to the client that you’re willing to do the extra work, to go a little further, to do the unexpected.</p>",
  "<p>This doesn’t require a ton of extra time but it does require some deliberate effort and sensitivity - to think about the client’s reality - the meetings, projects, pressures they’re facing right now - and think about how you can proactively support them.</p>",
  "<p>You could re-draw the diagram from up above as follows:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/advice-2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Whether your client is facing an important decision, or preparing for a board meeting or working through a bunch of menial tasks - whatever it is there’s typically a way for you to help out in some small way. And in doing so the client feels a sense of momentum and builds a sense of trust between you.</p>",
  "<p>What’s the next most useful thing?</p>",
  "<p>It’s not about ignoring the SOW or the project plan but it’s about recognizing that there’s value in giving your client a sense of momentum.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: I worked with a B2B saas client a few years ago - they were a small startup looking to raise their series B round and we engaged to create a content strategy.</p>",
  "  <p>On this project I made a mistake and despite the fact the client didn’t have any in-house editorial resources I took their request at face value and we structured the project around a 6-week content strategy.</p>",
  "  <p>I delivered what I think is good quality work with a deeply researched and evidence-based 66-page strategy for producing content and…. Nothing happened? They were happy enough with the work product but it didn’t lead to any material change in their strategy or an ongoing consulting relationship.</p>",
  "  <p>In hindsight the key mistake here was not asking myself enough what the next most useful thing was. I think if I’d been more honest about what would add value and show momentum for the client it would have been either a) condensed one or two slide summary of the content opportunity for their fundraising deck and/or b) supporting their VP marketing recruitment effort.</p>",
  "  <p>Perhaps I should have done both. Either way - it turns out that what the client wanted wasn’t really what the client needed and this mismatch led to a fairly unproductive engagement.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Recognizing that clients are unreliable narrators when it comes to scoping projects and defining timelines allows for a more philosophical view of value when it comes to consulting.</p>",
  "<p>Is a 6 week strategy project really the most useful thing the client needs right now? What happens at that point when we have the strategy defined - then what? By seeking more context, clarity and insight into momentum we can more easily work on things that the client will truly appreciate, not just provide things the client asked for.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-conclusion-about-owls\">A Conclusion About Owls</h2>",
  "<p>There’s an internet meme about giving advice that I love. It’s an image that shows you how to draw an owl:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-19-16-44-52.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Too much bad consulting work looks like either step 1 or step 2. Either you’re telling the client <em>“draw some circles”</em> and the client is frustrated the advice is too basic and high level. Or you’re telling the client to <em>“draw the rest of the fucking owl”</em> and are ignoring the detailed reality of the situation and the limitations of teams, resources and capabilities.</p>",
  "<p>Or worse, the client asked you for help drawing owls but what they’re really doing is painting a woodland scene…</p>",
  "<p>Think about this image next time a client comes to you for help drawing owls - your first response shouldn’t be <em>“Oh, that’s easy, first you draw some circles”</em>, it should be <em>“Show me how your owls look today. What do you think is holding you back from drawing better owls? And why is drawing owls important to you right now?”</em></p>",
  "<p>Remember - it’s about adopting a collaborative, trusted stance with clients. And that might require resisting your initial urge to give advice. Instead you need to listen to the full emotional and political situation and then work with the client to re-examine reality in new and surprising ways.</p>",
  "<p>Always work on the next most useful thing. And that doesn’t always involve doing what the client asked for.</p><br />"

  "<blockquote><br />  <p><em>“It is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor’s job is to be helpful.” David Maister - The Trusted Advisor</em></p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p><em>“I can DO IT!”</em> my 7 year old screams at me. She asked for help with her homework, but now - half way through explaining the place value of numbers - she had enough of my help and was physically and emotionally pushing me away - <em>“I can DO IT already”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Of course, she proceeded to not be able to do it.</p>",
  "<p><em>“Yes I know that!”</em> I shouted in exasperation. I was making pancakes for the kids and had only skim-read the recipe. As a result I had forgotten to melt the butter before adding it to the mixture and it was all lumpy. My partner Erin looked over and said <em>“you should have melted the butter before you put it in, would you like me to give you a recipe?”</em>. I had a recipe, but obviously I hadn’t followed it and knew that I had made a mistake. <em>“I KNOW I should have melted the butter, that’s not helpful to me right now!”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is emotionally fraught and complicated. It’s true for 7 year olds, it’s true for me and it’s true for my clients.</p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is an intensely personal thing. The feeling of learning something new sits right next to the feeling of shame for not knowing it in the first place. And worse, in the client/consultant relationship, the client is at least partially complicit in the situation when they come to you.</p>",
  "<p>So, some of the things that might seem “obvious” to you as a consultant can actually be incredibly delicate and problematic. Consider:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Quickly pointing out potential problems with the situation</li><br />  <li>Immediately offering a solution to these problems</li><br />  <li>Stating that things are easily solved</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>You do these things because you want to be seen as an expert, you want to reassure the client that you have the answer and that the client is in good hands.</p>",
  "<p>But think carefully about how these things make the client feel. They can make the client feel stupid, it can place a fair share of blame on the client for the situation and it can make them feel like you didn’t listen carefully enough to their description of the problem before leaping to solutions.</p>",
  "<p>So in this chapter we’re going to look at ways to <strong>resist the urge to add immediate value</strong>. Instead we have to hold space for a more vulnerable, honest and open relationship with our client - to allow them to open up more fully and to work on things that are useful, even if not in scope.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"from-consultant-to-advisor\">From Consultant to Advisor</h2>",

  "<p><img src=\"/images/advice.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is fraught even if the problem is well defined and you <em>do</em> know the answer. So when you’re working on strategic, ill-defined projects where there isn’t a <em>right</em> answer - giving advice is incredibly delicate, and in some cases not even possible.</p>",
  "<p>Eventually in your career you might even stop thinking of yourself as a consultant and start thinking of yourself as an advisor.</p>",
  "<p>And as we see in the diagram - <strong>in order to get access to the deeper emotional layers of advice giving and receiving we need to formulate a close relationship with our clients</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>While giving advice can help you be seen as knowledgeable, it doesn’t necessarily build trust.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"you-should-is-a-dangerous-phrase\">“You should…” is a dangerous phrase</h2>",
  "<p>One of the biggest mistakes a consultant can make is to think that you’re there to give advice and solve client problems. It’s so easy to let this little phrase creep into your work:</p>",
  "<p><em>“You should…”</em></p>",
  "<p>It’s a simple sounding phrase but it gets you in trouble more often than not. It’s problematic for two reasons: it assumes a control of client resources and it’s too prescriptive in form:</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"1-you-should-assumes-you-can-allocate-client-resources\">1. “You should…” assumes you can allocate client resources</h3>",
  "<p>It’s a fundamental mistake to assume that as a consultant we can allocate client resources.

  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: working with a client where I wanted to re-design a landing page on their site to improve it.

  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>Regulation/compliance complexity</strong> - which either prevents you even doing your recommendation or makes it slower.</li><br />  <li><strong>Technical complexity</strong> - while something might be technically easy, doing it with the client’s existing technology might be hard.</li><br />  <li><strong>Data complexity</strong> - a simple seeming request on the surface (make a landing page for every neighborhood) might actually depend on a robust, maintained data set that doesn’t yet exist.</li><br />  <li><strong>Maintenance complexity</strong> - even if the initial request to create something or do something is not resource intensive, it might come with an implicit agreement to continue to maintain it - expanding the resources allocated.</li><br />  <li><strong>Production complexity</strong> - where what you’re proposing isn’t that expensive or resource intensive to do, but the client (for whatever reason) has a higher quality threshold, making the recommendation more expensive/slower/harder than you anticipated.</li><br />  <li><strong>Narrative complexity</strong> - where what you’re recommending seems reasonable but either the company has tried it before, or a competitor has tried it before or there’s a general sense that “this doesn’t work”. Which can make your recommendation extremely hard to actually get done.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h3 id=\"2-you-should-is-too-prescriptive-in-form\">2. “You should…” is too prescriptive in form</h3>",
  "<p>In addition to under-estimating the problem, we also over-fit the solution. After all, as we saw in the chapter <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/\">The Consultant’s Grain</a>, as independent consultants we often bias towards our own natural strengths and areas of expertise.</p>",
  "<p>When we say <em>“You should…”</em> we’re essentially offering a problem diagnosis AND a solution at the same time. The consequence of this is that we’re essentially asking the client to accept or reject both together.</p>",
  "<p>Instead, most of your work would be more effective at actually changing clients if you stopped to clearly separate the diagnosis from the solution. If you don’t properly win over all the necessary stakeholders at the client’s side you’re going to face resistance trying to get anything done.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: I was working with Gartner Digital Markets on some SEO strategy and I felt that we needed to work on some more transformative work than simple technical SEO fixes - their core landing pages were offering a worse user experience than the competition and we were losing ground.</p>",
  "  <p>Persuading the rest of the organization that this was a problem wasn’t straightforward. We’d been saying that these pages needed overhauling and it felt like no one was listening. So we ran a small user survey to ask a series of 10 “Google quality rater questions”. This allowed us to present our findings to the senior leadership team at Gartner and I remember showing something like this:</p>",
  "  <p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-19-16-04-03.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "  <p>Instantly, people leaned in around the table and there was a lot of executive interest. Saying something like “we should improve our pages” is too bland and generic - it only serves to win over people who already agree with you. It lacks any kind of rigor or weight to win someone over who already has their own opinions and roadmap.</p>",
  "  <p>In this situation - the survey allowed us to <em>quantify</em> the problem correctly and provided compelling evidence, we didn’t even need to offer a solution! Articulating the problem was enough to convince the necessary teams to take action and prioritize work.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>So if you’re asking <em>“You should…”</em> to the client, stop and examine if you’ve properly defined the situation and provided evidence for the problem, to help the client deeply internalize the problem and win over the necessary stakeholders before you propose any kind of solution.</p>",
  "<p>A good mental exercise to ensure you’re doing the work here is to ask yourself: what happens if the client takes no action? What is the consequence of the current trajectory, or the null case of no investment? This will help you bring some rigor to the question of what the consequence of the problem truly is and allow the problem to be quantified relative to other projects and investment opportunities.</p>",
  "<p>So, what’s the alternative?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"there-is-an-opportunity-to\">“There is an opportunity to…”</h2>",
  "<p>This phrase is the key - it places the focus correctly on first defining the problem - and then providing evidence - before focusing on the solution. It allows us to articulate and quantify the opportunity while leaving room for the client to have say over resource allocation, for the client to shape the solution and for the client to determine prioritization and timing.</p>",
  "<p>Of course in reality, you’re often involved in shaping the solution too - but it’s crucial to ensure that you’re not skipping over the step of clearly defining the size and shape of the opportunity before getting to the solution.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: Working with an ecommerce site to define an SEO strategy part of my recommendation involved investing in content strategy to drive links, traffic and conversions - but before even getting into the shape of the solution, i.e. <em>how</em> we would invest in content it’s important to articulate what the opportunity is.</p>",
  "  <p>By looking at relevant competitors we can estimate the potential traffic and revenue opportunity:</p>",
  "  <p><img src=\"/images/advice-quantified.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "  <p>By showing what’s possible, clients are able to feel more invested in designing the solution with you, rather than just being told what to do.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>This can also be uncomfortable! There are many situations where quantifying the exact opportunity is difficult, requires estimation or requires a different approach (like we saw with the Gartner surveys).</p>",
  "<p>But consider the alternative - the alternative is recommending something to the client… because we say so?</p>",
  "<p>This isn’t necessarily wrong - there’s value in expert opinion - but in my experience clients deeply appreciate you clearly separating out expert opinion and judgment from evidence-based analysis.</p>",
  "<p>As David Maister says in the Trusted Advisor - the best approach is:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>A good process for the advisor to follow is:</p>",
  "  <ol><br />    <li>Give them their options</li><br />    <li>Give them an education about their options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth)</li><br />    <li>Give them a recommendation</li><br />    <li>Let them choose</li><br />  </ol><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This stance essentially allows you as the consultant to own the diagnosis and quantification of the opportunity and then collaboratively with the client to shape the solution and prioritization.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"lets-look-at-the-problem-together\">Let’s look at the problem together</h2>",
  "<p>Taking a collaborative stance with your client is powerful. There are many aspects of consulting that are almost combative by nature - like pointing out problems the client has (that the client was complicit in creating!).</p>",
  "<p>As we saw in the chapter <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/\">Optimism as an Operating System</a>, walking into a client with a critical eye can create a distance between you and the client.</p>",
  "<p>Instead you want to create a kind of shoulder-to-shoulder stance with the client, facing towards the problems together. This creates a much safer, judgment free way to look at the problems (and opportunities) facing the client.</p>",
  "<p>In fact, for senior executives - sometimes you really <em>can’t</em> give them advice - they’re too type-A and overly confident. The only way to convince them is to help them see the problem in a new light - to see things as you see them.</p>",
  "<p>This idea is demonstrated beautifully by Timothy Gallway in The Inner Game of Tennis where he recounts teaching a senior executive how to improve their backhand:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>One day in the summer of 1971 when I was teaching a group of men at John Gardiner’s Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, a businessman realized how much more power and control he got on his backhand when his racket was taken back below the level of the ball. He was so enthusiastic about his “new” stroke that he rushed to tell his friend Jack about it as if some kind of miracle had occurred. Jack, who considered his erratic backhand one of the major problems of his life, came rushing up to me during the lunch hour, exclaiming, “I’ve always had a terrible backhand. Maybe you can help me.”</p>",
  "  <p>I asked, “What’s so terrible about your backhand?”</p>",
  "  <p>“I take my racket back too high on my backswing.”</p>",
  "  <p>“How do you know?”</p>",
  "  <p>“Because at least five different pros have told me so. I just haven’t been able to correct it.”</p>",
  "  <p>For a brief moment I was aware of the absurdity of the situation. Here was a business executive who controlled large commercial enterprises of great complexity asking me for help as if he had no control over his own right arm. Why wouldn’t it be possible, I wondered, to give him the simple reply, “Sure, I can help you. L-o-w-e-r y-o-u-r r-a-c-k-e-t!”</p>",
  "  <p>But complaints such as Jack’s are common among people of all levels of intelligence and proficiency. Besides, it was clear that at least five other pros had told him to lower his racket without much effect. What was keeping him from doing it? I wondered.</p>",
  "  <p>I asked Jack to take a few swings on the patio where we were standing. His backswing started back very low, but then, sure enough, just before swinging forward it lifted to the level of his shoulder and swung down into the imagined ball. The five pros were right. I asked him to swing several more times without making any comment. “Isn’t that better?” he asked. “I tried to keep it low.” But each time just before swinging forward, his racket lifted; it was obvious that had he been hitting an actual ball, the underspin imparted by the downward swing would have caused it to sail out. “Your backhand is all right,” I said reassuringly. “It’s just going through some changes. Why don’t you take a closer look at it.” We walked over to a large windowpane and there I asked him to swing again while watching his reflection. He did so, again taking his characteristic hitch at the back of his swing, but this time he was astounded. “Hey, I really do take my racket back high! It goes up above my shoulder!” There was no judgment in his voice; he was just reporting with amazement what his eyes had seen.</p>",
  "  <p>What surprised me was Jack’s surprise. Hadn’t he said that five pros had told him his racket was too high? I was certain that if I had told him the same thing after his first swing, he would have replied, “Yes, I know.” But what was now clear was that he didn’t really know, since no one is ever surprised at seeing something they already know. Despite all those lessons, he had never directly experienced his racket going back high. His mind had been so absorbed in the process of judgment and trying to change this “bad” stroke that he had never perceived the stroke itself.</p>",
  "  <p>Looking in the glass which mirrored his stroke as it was, Jack was able to keep his racket low quite effortlessly as he swung again. “That feels entirely different than any backhand I’ve ever swung,” he declared. By now he was swinging up and through the ball over and over again. Interestingly, he wasn’t congratulating himself for doing it right; he was simply absorbed in how different it felt.</p>",
  "  <p>After lunch I threw Jack a few balls and he was able to remember how the stroke felt and to repeat the action. This time he just felt where his racket was going, letting his sense of feel replace the visual image offered by the mirror. It was a new experience for him. Soon he was consistently hitting topspin backhands into the court with an effortlessness that made it appear this was his natural swing. In ten minutes he was feeling “in the groove,” and he paused to express his gratitude. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you’ve done for me. I’ve learned more in ten minutes from you than in twenty hours of lessons I’ve taken on my backhand.” I could feel something inside me begin to puff up as it absorbed these “good” words. At the same time, I didn’t know quite how to handle this lavish compliment, and found myself hemming and hawing, trying to come up with an appropriately modest reply. Then, for a moment, my mind turned off and I realized that I hadn’t given Jack a single instruction on his backhand! “But what did I teach you?” I asked. He was quiet for a full half-minute, trying to remember what I had told him. Finally he said, “I can’t remember your telling me anything! You were just there watching, and you got me watching myself closer than I ever had before. Instead of seeing what was wrong with my backhand, I just started observing, and improvement seemed to happen on its own. I’m not sure why, but I certainly learned a lot in a short period of time.” He had learned, but had he been “taught”?</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This is about tennis (is it?) but equally applies to consulting! I find in my own work that senior executives are often blocked by some inability to see what’s actually going on - and that telling them is useless! Instead you need to help them see it for themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Because of their distance from the day to day work, senior executives are especially prone to replacing some version of reality with a compressed narrative. And when this compressed narrative is wrong in some key way you need to return to first principles to show them (not tell them!).</p>",
  "<p>Much like we saw with the example of the Gartner surveys - helping clients see with fresh eyes what’s really going is powerful and can be profoundly useful before you even begin suggesting solutions.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"understanding-the-problem-in-all-of-its-emotional-and-political-complexity\">Understanding the problem in all of its emotional and political complexity</h2>",
  "<p>Once you adopt this collaborative stance with the client you begin to see that the problems as you thought you understood them, are not in fact the full picture.</p>",
  "<p>Your sense of “what’s going on” with a client is intermediated by your point of contact and it turns out that your client is an unreliable narrator. Remember - best case they have problems they’ve been unable to solve on their own, worst case they were actively responsible for creating the problems in the first place!</p>",
  "<p>So it’s no wonder that clients often down-play, mis-represent and mask the full emotional and political complexity of what’s going on. Especially when you first start working together and haven’t yet earned their trust.</p>",
  "<p>But for you to do your job it’s crucial that you get a full picture of what’s really going on. And further, clients deeply appreciate a consultant that can listen and observe closely enough to see what’s really going on.</p>",
  "<p>As David Maister says in <a href=\"https://davidmaister.com/articles/the-consultants-role/\">The Consultant’s Role</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“It can be unsettling to find that the client is primarily interested in having his or her problem understood, in all its emotional and political complexity, as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>What this is saying is that you need to earn the client’s trust in order to be effective at your job. This isn’t at all obvious! When a client comes to you asking for a “content strategy” or support “hiring a VP marketing” it all seems so straightforward, rational and well defined. But as you unpack the layers of the onion you begin to realize why it’s been so hard for the client to help themselves. And that’s when the emotional and political complexity of the problem starts to come into view.</p>",
  "<p>Developing a sensitivity to the emotional and political context of client problems requires an active listening and sensing instinct on behalf of the consultant - to use your own lived experience inside the client’s organization as a way to sense what the inner work life is like inside your client’s business. As Ruth Orenstein says in her book <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Multidimensional_Executive_Coaching/FVHnN1-O-rQC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Multidimensional Executive Coaching</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>For the time he/she is present, the consultant becomes part of the multidimensional system, both influencing it and being influenced by it. To do the work of executive coach- ing, then, the consultant must be able to tolerate, and ultimately make use of, entering a highly complex place-a place that is occupied by neither the individual nor the organization alone but, because of their convergence, both the individual and the organization together; a place that contains both the exigencies of working life and the impulses of the psyche; and a place that engages and, in turn, is engaged by the consultant’s own intrapsychic material. In addition, if the work is done effectively, it requires that the consultant be both involved enough in the dynamics so as to experience their impact and detached enough so as to analyze what is transpiring. These demands make imperative the use of oneself as tool.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>Remember: when clients first come to you, your first instinct might be to dismiss the problem as “easily solved”. But you need to hold space to truly consider that the thing that seems easy is, in this particular situation, with this particular client actually not at all easy. And that’s when the work begins.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-next-most-useful-thing\">The Next Most Useful Thing</h2>",
  "<p>This all builds up to my personal consulting mantra: always work on the next most useful thing.</p>",
  "<p>This mantra helps remind me that consulting isn’t about being right, it’s about being useful.</p>",
  "<p>As a consultant - it’s crucial that you’re generating momentum, that clients can <em>feel a sense of progress in your work</em>. A consultant is typically an expensive investment and without a sense of progress or momentum your engagement will stall out.</p>",
  "<p>Importantly however, a sense of progress and momentum doesn’t have to come from the official SOW or project plan. Actual progress is one thing - but a <em>sense of progress</em> is just that - it’s about your client feeling like things are moving forward.</p>",
  "<p>In fact, depending on the project and the client - moving at the expected pace can be too slow! Even after agreeing on a scope, project plan and set of next steps, moving as fast as you said you would can be disappointing to the client.</p>",
  "<p>Remember - building a great client relationship is about trust. And doing the minimum doesn’t build trust. So it’s important to demonstrate to the client that you’re willing to do the extra work, to go a little further, to do the unexpected.</p>",
  "<p>This doesn’t require a ton of extra time but it does require some deliberate effort and sensitivity - to think about the client’s reality - the meetings, projects, pressures they’re facing right now - and think about how you can proactively support them.</p>",
  "<p>You could re-draw the diagram from up above as follows:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/advice-2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Whether your client is facing an important decision, or preparing for a board meeting or working through a bunch of menial tasks - whatever it is there’s typically a way for you to help out in some small way. And in doing so the client feels a sense of momentum and builds a sense of trust between you.</p>",
  "<p>What’s the next most useful thing?</p>",
  "<p>It’s not about ignoring the SOW or the project plan but it’s about recognizing that there’s value in giving your client a sense of momentum.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: I worked with a B2B saas client a few years ago - they were a small startup looking to raise their series B round and we engaged to create a content strategy.</p>",
  "  <p>On this project I made a mistake and despite the fact the client didn’t have any in-house editorial resources I took their request at face value and we structured the project around a 6-week content strategy.</p>",
  "  <p>I delivered what I think is good quality work with a deeply researched and evidence-based 66-page strategy for producing content and…. Nothing happened? They were happy enough with the work product but it didn’t lead to any material change in their strategy or an ongoing consulting relationship.</p>",
  "  <p>In hindsight the key mistake here was not asking myself enough what the next most useful thing was. I think if I’d been more honest about what would add value and show momentum for the client it would have been either a) condensed one or two slide summary of the content opportunity for their fundraising deck and/or b) supporting their VP marketing recruitment effort.</p>",
  "  <p>Perhaps I should have done both. Either way - it turns out that what the client wanted wasn’t really what the client needed and this mismatch led to a fairly unproductive engagement.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Recognizing that clients are unreliable narrators when it comes to scoping projects and defining timelines allows for a more philosophical view of value when it comes to consulting.</p>",
  "<p>Is a 6 week strategy project really the most useful thing the client needs right now? What happens at that point when we have the strategy defined - then what? By seeking more context, clarity and insight into momentum we can more easily work on things that the client will truly appreciate, not just provide things the client asked for.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-conclusion-about-owls\">A Conclusion About Owls</h2>",
  "<p>There’s an internet meme about giving advice that I love. It’s an image that shows you how to draw an owl:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-19-16-44-52.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Too much bad consulting work looks like either step 1 or step 2. Either you’re telling the client <em>“draw some circles”</em> and the client is frustrated the advice is too basic and high level. Or you’re telling the client to <em>“draw the rest of the fucking owl”</em> and are ignoring the detailed reality of the situation and the limitations of teams, resources and capabilities.</p>",
  "<p>Or worse, the client asked you for help drawing owls but what they’re really doing is painting a woodland scene…</p>",
  "<p>Think about this image next time a client comes to you for help drawing owls - your first response shouldn’t be <em>“Oh, that’s easy, first you draw some circles”</em>, it should be <em>“Show me how your owls look today. What do you think is holding you back from drawing better owls? And why is drawing owls important to you right now?”</em></p>",
  "<p>Remember - it’s about adopting a collaborative, trusted stance with clients. And that might require resisting your initial urge to give advice. Instead you need to listen to the full emotional and political situation and then work with the client to re-examine reality in new and surprising ways.</p>",
  "<p>Always work on the next most useful thing. And that doesn’t always involve doing what the client asked for.</p><br />"

  "<h2 id=\"replit\">Replit</h2>",
  "<p>Tinkering with the web is a foundational part of my identity. I’ve called this <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/\">digital bricolage</a> before. I’m not a real developer, just like I’m not a real designer and yet I build things on Replit all the time!</p>",
  "<p>I’m a huge advocate for tools that lower the bar to entry for more users and help people expand what they think is possible. Couple that with a deep frustration at how most developer tools on board users (see: <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/\">why can’t I code inside my browser</a>) and Replit is a dream client.</p>",
  "<p>I recently built a little bookmarklet and app for a client using Replit that gave an x-ray vision overlay on their website with a bunch of custom analysis and stats - took me a few hours to prototype and opened up a bunch of interesting conversations! I love that kind of thing.</p>",
  "<p>So how might we work together? Some ideas:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Replit has a real search problem - if you search for examples and templates on Google you get stuck in a list of Replit pages that look the same, with many of them being low-quality. There’s a crawling, architecture and internal linking strategy here to dramatically improve the ability for people to find high quality Replit examples and templates.</li><br />  <li>You can import Github repos directly into Replit which feels like magic when it works! Except it’s very hard to know if it’s going to work ahead of time. I think there are opportunities here around better messaging / workflows / community standards to help people better understand whether a github repo can be imported directly into Replit, and if so how to do it.</li><br />  <li>The education play on Replit seems very successful with the 100 days of code in particular. I’d love to expand this idea into potentially more cohort-based models of building projects. Less “learn to code” and more “build something interesting, together”.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p>Figma has changed my life. I spend all day long staring at my glowing rectangle of a computer screen but what is <em>on</em> that screen has meaningfully changed in the last few years. Even though I’m not a designer and don’t get hired for “design” work I spend 50%+ of my time in Figma.</p>",
  "<p>A canvas is just a beautiful and useful place to think.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve talked before about making <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/06/28/one-page-strategy/\">strategy maps</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1737153195237888061\">beautiful charts</a> and more in Figma. I even ran a cohort based course around non-design uses of Figma called <a href=\"https://figmathinkers.com/\">Figma Thinkers</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Much like the underlying javascript technology of ajax ushered in Gmail and with it a whole paradigm of “apps in the browser” I believe that the technical advances in making the open canvas work will usher in a whole new paradigm of canvas-based apps.</p>",
  "<p>Relevant: <a href=\"https://infinitecanvas.tools/\">infinitecanvas.tools</a></p>",
  "<p>I’m such a fanboy that I’d work with Figma on anything ha. But here’s a few ideas:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Exploring non-design / non-product use cases for Figma. What if we built a new team inside Figma that aimed at winning over McKinsey and all the big consulting firms to use Figma day to day. What would that look like? How would the product need to evolve? How might we open up a whole new segment of the market?</li><br />  <li>How can we do more interesting, adventurous editorial projects? Inspired by <a href=\"https://press.stripe.com/\">Stripe press</a> and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/IV5AGF2aV75vau327SUKSy/CRYPTO-PHILANTHROPY?node-id=0%3A1&amp;utm_source=figmathinkers&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=figma-thinkers-week-8-creative-figma-uses\">Figma essays</a>. How might we explore a wider, more creative range of publishing and editorial projects to show off what Figma can do?</li><br />  <li>From an SEO perspective, Canva has done a masterful job with templates, tools and content designed for SEO and gets… <em>checks notes</em>… about 3400% more Google traffic<sup id=\"fnref:figma\"><a href=\"#fn:figma\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. What would the Figma equivalent SEO play be here?</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"replit\">Replit</h2>",
  "<p>Tinkering with the web is a foundational part of my identity. I’ve called this <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/\">digital bricolage</a> before. I’m not a real developer, just like I’m not a real designer and yet I build things on Replit all the time!</p>",
  "<p>I’m a huge advocate for tools that lower the bar to entry for more users and help people expand what they think is possible. Couple that with a deep frustration at how most developer tools on board users (see: <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/\">why can’t I code inside my browser</a>) and Replit is a dream client.</p>",
  "<p>I recently built a little bookmarklet and app for a client using Replit that gave an x-ray vision overlay on their website with a bunch of custom analysis and stats - took me a few hours to prototype and opened up a bunch of interesting conversations! I love that kind of thing.</p>",
  "<p>So how might we work together? Some ideas:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Replit has a real search problem - if you search for examples and templates on Google you get stuck in a list of Replit pages that look the same, with many of them being low-quality. There’s a crawling, architecture and internal linking strategy here to dramatically improve the ability for people to find high quality Replit examples and templates.</li><br />  <li>You can import Github repos directly into Replit which feels like magic when it works! Except it’s very hard to know if it’s going to work ahead of time. I think there are opportunities here around better messaging / workflows / community standards to help people better understand whether a github repo can be imported directly into Replit, and if so how to do it.</li><br />  <li>The education play on Replit seems very successful with the 100 days of code in particular. I’d love to expand this idea into potentially more cohort-based models of building projects. Less “learn to code” and more “build something interesting, together”.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<h2 id=\"narrative-aircover\">Narrative Aircover</h2>",
  "<p>When I quit my last job almost 10 years ago, I didn’t know that I’d end up doing so much consulting work, or that I’d end up identifying so strongly with the label “independent consultant”.</p>",
  "<p>It turns out when I quit my job I was actually trying to build an art startup with my partner: Fiercely Curious. You can see from this email exchange that <a href=\"https://www.fiercelycurious.com/\">Fiercely Curious</a> is the primary label and identity I’m using:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-14-41-34.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>It took about 9-12 months of juggling some consulting work and building an art startup to realize that:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Consulting pays far better than building an art startup (who knew!)</li><br />  <li>I actually enjoyed consulting</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>This was about the time that I decided to go “all in” on consulting, to start using that label and identify that way. Importantly by that stage I’d had 4-5 solid consulting projects and had some confidence that “consultant” meant something more than just “unemployed freelancer”.</p>",
  "<p>This was all kind of accidental but in hindsight incredibly valuable - the ability to lean on Fiercely Curious as a project with some kind of substance allowed me to show up in the world, to have conversations with people, to network, to tell people what I was up to.</p>",
  "<p>All while I muddled my way through becoming a consultant.</p>",
  "<p>That’s why I call this “narrative aircover” because it provides shelter and protection to the emerging identity while it’s still incredibly fragile.</p>",
  "<p>In my case, my narrative aircover was in the shape of an art business. In your case it could be an online food magazine, or a meetup event series, or a podcast.</p>",
  "<p>The key thing for narrative aircover is that it’s expansive, passionate and unblocked.</p>",
  "<p>I think the following characteristics are most useful for narrative aircover to provide you value in the early stages of starting a consulting business:</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"1-expansive-to-grow-your-surface-area\">1. Expansive to grow your surface area</h3>",
  "<p>While our consulting identity is small and fragile it can be easy to close up - to adopt a stance of safety. “Who am I to talk about being a consultant, I barely have any clients!” or “What do I have to say on LinkedIn, I’m not even working right now!”.</p>",
  "<p>But growing and nurturing your network is essential to building a long term sustainable indie consulting career so in the early days it’s important to do things that open you up - open you up to opportunities, connections, conversations and clients. So you need to pick something that’s expansive - something that opens you up to invite connection.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: When Vicky Gu went out as an independent brand and content strategist - she leaned on narrative aircover of her online food magazine <a href=\"https://staycurrant.com/\">Currant</a>. There, she is able to describe herself as a “managing editor” (see how easy it is to award yourself labels in a permissionless world!).</p>",
  "  <p>Currant is expansive - it is a way in for Vicky to have conversations with chefs, restaurant owners, writers, designers and all sorts of other folks in the making of a digital publication. But it’s also expansive in the sense that through sharing editorial pieces about food, she can reach new audiences.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>The idea that your narrative aircover is something that can invite people to lean in allows you to easily have new conversations with new people and expand your surface area. Whether it’s an email list, event series or non-profit.</p>",
  "<p>You want a project that opens doors - something that gives you an excuse to be public, visible and interesting. Building something that is a permission tool to give yourself permission to reach out to people, to meet people for coffee, to connect and to build your network.</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"2-passionate-to-show-off-your-vibes\">2. Passionate to show off your vibes</h3>",
  "<p>As we saw in <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/\">Strange Attraction</a>, the value of your network comes from all kinds of weird and wonderful places - it isn’t always the people you would expect. And as we saw in <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/16/rejecting-specialization/\">Rejecting Specialization</a> to secure senior level projects you need to expose your vibes.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s important to have something <em>interesting</em> that you can talk about. My art startup is a great conversation starter - a lot of people are interested in art and culture. Just like lots of people are interested in Vicky’s food magazine.</p>",
  "<p>Launching a narrative aircover project that is inherently aligned with your passions will help ensure that people are paying attention, leaning in and taking your meetings.</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"3-unblocked-so-its-within-your-control\">3. Unblocked so it’s within your control</h3>",
  "<p>Finally, you want your narrative aircover project to be more under your own control than consulting work. One of the primary problems to solve is that you likely don’t currently have a lot of consulting work to rely on or talk about - you’re dependent on clients to move things forward.</p>",
  "<p>So you want your narrative aircover project to be <strong>alive by default</strong> - not blocked and relying on others to move forward but something that you can move forward under your own steam. Even a humble blog can fit the requirements here - free to publish as and when you want without any kind of gatekeepers or dependencies on others.</p>",
  "<p>In summary - indie consultants are creatures of momentum and narrative aircover is how you get started. It’s about creating activation energy in your network to start making something happen - because without that you’re going to just sit there and worry about finding clients.</p>",
  "<p>Narrative aircover isn’t about hiding our consulting identity - it’s about not leaning on it too hard during the early days when it’s most fragile and still evolving.</p>",
  "<p>Narrative aircover provides you meaning, labels, safety and permission to engage with people while you’re figuring things out during the first year or so of your journey.</p>",
  "<h1 id=\"part-2-compound-narrative\">Part 2: Compound Narrative</h1>",
  "<p>Eventually, at some point down the road you will successfully manage to generate revenue, find clients and build a consulting practice that <em>works</em> - your next problem is figuring out how to make it sustainable.</p>",
  "<p>Understandably - so much of your focus in the first few years of setting up your practice is on consistently generating clients. That is after all the most important thing you need. One client after another. Line em up.</p>",
  "<p>But at some point you can end up stuck - feeling like every client is simply another spin of the hamster wheel. Trapped in your own constraints of client work you’re feeling like there’s a never-ending series of client projects on the treadmill. A feeling that every client is starting from zero again.</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-14-57-47.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<div class=\"tc f5 i\">The never-ending treadmill of client work</div>",
  "<p>One of the biggest downsides of consulting is that there’s nothing passive about the revenue - nothing compounds. To pay rent each month you have to keep generating clients.</p>",
  "<p>This is why, once you reach some stability with consistently generating clients and revenue, many indie consultants begin to think about “scaling themselves” - either in the form of hiring staff or in building “passive income” products.</p>",
  "<p>This reflex isn’t bad per se but it’s important to recognize that they are avoiding the real problem. They are avoidance of dealing with the root issue of actually enjoying your consulting work. Of finding a way to value and enjoy client work over long periods of time.</p>",
  "<p>Some of the things we’ve talked about in the book can help you enjoy your work: shifting to strategic clients helps keep the work interesting and focusing on being impactful helps the work feel meaningful. But at some point it can start to feel like a grind.</p>",
  "<p>The problem is that outside of the constraints and norms of full time work, a defined career and job progression - there’s no simple measure for professional advancement.</p>",
  "<p>No one is paying for training, no one is sending you to conferences. No one is giving you a promotion or a new job title.</p>",
  "<p>So you have to find your own personal growth plan - a way to both find intrinsic meaning in growth and development and in externally visible progress towards being “more senior” and able to move upwards inside client organizations. Otherwise you’ll stagnate, your earnings will plateau and your public image will stall out.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"fitting-every-client-into-a-narrative-frame\">Fitting every client into a narrative frame</h2>",
  "<p>The trick here is to use each client as a compound build on the last one, not simply another go around the treadmill.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: In my own work - in year 2, after finding some routine in generating clients and steady work - a friend asked for advice on going out on their own, so I wrote up a blog post with some thoughts. That blog post generated a few more blog posts about the practice of independent consulting and before you know it I was writing this book (a project that would creatively sustain me with compound narrative for the next 6+ years!)</p>",
  "  <p>The trick is that every new client isn’t simply a chance to do the same thing but it’s a chance to deepen my perspective and experience on the practice of independent consulting. Every client can teach you something.</p>",
  "  <p>Now I gleefully look forward to new clients because I know they can become stories and examples for my book project.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>I call this idea <strong>compound narrative</strong>. You need some way to feel like every client builds on the last one - that you’re left starting from somewhere new, not starting from the same place every time.</p>",
  "<p>Then - the trick is to view every single client, no matter how “boring” or “routine” or “straightforward” on the surface - as being part of that compound narrative. What insights or evidence can you gather towards your questions through this client project?</p>",
  "<p>Niko Canner calls this “<a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade\">mastery of a larger game</a>”:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>The medium to do this larger work was in writing. In my prior chapter as a founder, building Katzenbach Partners, I’d never given myself much space to write, because that had never felt as important to my goals as the work of entrepreneurial leadership, rainmaking and advising clients. <strong>I needed to change that, and to recognize that writing would be my vehicle for reaching toward greater mastery of a larger game. Writing wasn’t in service of building an audience or building a business. Writing as a learning practice was an end in itself</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This might seem straightforward but the subtle trick is choosing a narrative frame that you’re <strong><em>actually interested in</em></strong>. For example, if you’re a digital PR consultant - the obvious learning frame for your work would be to learn about the practice of digital PR. Sure, this makes sense - except perhaps you’re not really interested in the idea of “digital PR” - it’s too broad and doesn’t have any kind of hook to it.</p>",
  "<p>The trick is to find a frame that lights up your curiosity - perhaps something like “how digital PR is evolving as new social platforms emerge” or “how companies measure the effectiveness of digital PR” or “why digital PR doesn’t get a seat at the executive table”.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"finding-the-right-learning-questions\">Finding the Right Learning Questions</h2>",
  "<p>Notice that these narrative frames are all open ended questions that possess a measure of <strong>specific curiosity</strong>. These narrative frames can be far more interesting by virtue of being more specific.</p>",
  "<p>Questions are powerful tools for shaping your thinking and perspective. Finding good questions can sustain and nourish your curiosity and help you feel alive. They’re the antidote to burnout and stagnation.</p>",
  "<p>But how do you find good questions?</p>",
  "<p>A great place to start is to write down a list of questions that you don’t know the answer to. Questions that might not even have an easy answer. Questions that you can explore over an extended period of time.</p>",
  "<p>The community Huddlecraft calls these <a href=\"https://medium.com/huddlecraft/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904\">learning questions</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.</p>",
  "  <p>Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.</p>",
  "  <p>Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>And they have this lovely 2x2 framework with examples of learning questions:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-15-00-51.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>This 2x2 framework feels right - if you write down 10 ideas for learning questions, you’ll be able to plot them (subjectively) on this 2x2 graph. It’s not that every single learning question needs to be impossible to answer and open ended, but those questions are going to be the ones with the most potential to nourish and sustain your practice for the longest.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: Behzod Sirjani is an independent consultant with a deep background in user research. To sustain his practice he has been researching and publishing OAE - a learning question around <a href=\"https://behzod.com/oae\">organizations as ecosystems</a>:</p>",
  "  <blockquote><br />    <p>“Organizations as Ecosystems” is a research and writing project about the ways that organizations sense, react, learn, and change. Some outputs of this project will be regular essays and a corresponding set of readings and references.</p><br />  </blockquote>",
  "  <p>This is a perfect open ended and impossible to fully answer. It’s easy to see how this question could sustain years of client work, where each client is an opportunity to explore and deepen your understanding of the question of how companies sense, react, learn and change.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Finding the right set of learning questions is incredibly powerful because it turns your consulting practice into a sustainable practice. It enables you to stay in the work for long multi-year periods. Because you have to stay in the work - if you’re an independent consultant there’s no one to do the work for you - no employees, no colleagues to lean on. So you have to stay in the work.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"compound-thinking--publishing\">Compound Thinking &amp; Publishing</h2>",
  "<p>The magical thing about finding questions you’re interested in and pursuing them for a while is that you end up with interesting things to say.</p>",
  "<p>As you deepen your understanding of the questions you’re interested in you find that these projects turn into generative and useful objects</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>For example, here’s John V Willshire back in 2015 talking about the famous “<a href=\"https://smithery.com/2015/01/07/three-2015-projects/\">Smithery Projects</a>” that he embarks on each year:</p>",
  "  <blockquote><br />    <p>“Ah, the famous annual Smithery projects. Well, famous might be pushing it, let’s go with ‘the thing that we do at the start of each year’. 2012 was about Making, 2013 was about Media, and 2014 was about Playing With Ideas, which in hindsight remained gloriously ill-defined but gave rise to August’s Culture Matrix malarkey, so we’ll let it off.”</p><br />  </blockquote>",
  "  <p>One of those projects eventually turned into a delightful foundational framework and approach called <a href=\"https://smithery.com/2020/12/01/starting-with-zenko-mapping/\">Zenko mapping</a> that is core to how Smithery operates.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>It’s part of why publishing is such a rich pursuit for indie consultants - it’s a culmination and focus on the act of <strong><em>accumulated insights</em></strong>. Turning your compound narrative into a published artefact is incredibly powerful - it positions you as an expert, builds an audience and is incredibly satisfying!</p>",
  "<p>There’s a rich vein of self-publishing by indie consultants:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The ux consultant writing <a href=\"https://4dthinking.studio/ux-book\">a book about UX design</a>.</li><br />  <li>The designer writing <a href=\"https://shapeofdesignbook.com/\">a book about design</a>.</li><br />  <li>The security consultant publishing <a href=\"https://www.spartan9.com/publications/crisis-simulations.html\">emergency extraction guides</a>.</li><br />  <li>The ethnographic researcher publishing <a href=\"https://www.thefieldstudyhandbook.com/\">the fieldguide to ethnographic research</a>.</li><br />  <li>The indie consultant publishing the book about independent consulting (coming soon!)</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>But it doesn’t have to be a book - publishing in all its forms can be an email newsletter, it can be a podcast, it can be a zine, it can be a research report.</p>",
  "<p>Any of these can work and in fact the ongoing nature of something like a podcast can help sustain an interest by becoming a vehicle not for promoting, but for learning! For <strong>continually being interested in the work you’re doing</strong>.</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/compound-learning.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>And if you do it all correctly, the sky’s the limit as April Dunford, author of Obviously Awesome, <a href=\"https://podcast.creatorscience.com/april-dunford/\">will testify</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“Getting the book out was absolutely transformational to the business. Like, that’s what took me from, this is a good business that pays me more than what my salary was in house, you know, yay me, consultant, to holy man. I didn’t even think it was possible to make this kind of money and work with this kind of clients and do this amazing stuff. And, yeah, the book was a game changer.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<h2 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h2>",
  "<p>The challenge of managing your own identity - free from any constraints and expectations of full time work - can be a surprising challenge. Realizing that you can be whoever you want to be comes with a sense of being untethered. Navigating that narrative journey requires anchoring ourselves to things - whether it’s narrative aircover of a self-directed project or the compound narrative of learning questions.</p>",
  "<p>And eventually, once you find a generative set of questions to explore, it can sustain an independent consulting practice for years - helping you generate interesting clients, enjoy every new client and build a sense of personal growth and progression.</p><br />"

  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: When Vicky Gu went out as an independent brand and content strategist - she leaned on narrative aircover of her online food magazine <a href=\"https://staycurrant.com/\">Currant</a>. There, she is able to describe herself as a “managing editor” (see how easy it is to award yourself labels in a permissionless world!).</p>",
  "  <p>Currant is expansive - it is a way in for Vicky to have conversations with chefs, restaurant owners, writers, designers and all sorts of other folks in the making of a digital publication. But it’s also expansive in the sense that through sharing editorial pieces about food, she can reach new audiences.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>The idea that your narrative aircover is something that can invite people to lean in allows you to easily have new conversations with new people and expand your surface area. Whether it’s an email list, event series or non-profit.</p>",
  "<p>You want a project that opens doors - something that gives you an excuse to be public, visible and interesting. Building something that is a permission tool to give yourself permission to reach out to people, to meet people for coffee, to connect and to build your network.</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"2-passionate-to-show-off-your-vibes\">2. Passionate to show off your vibes</h3>",
  "<p>As we saw in <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/\">Strange Attraction</a>, the value of your network comes from all kinds of weird and wonderful places - it isn’t always the people you would expect. And as we saw in <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/16/rejecting-specialization/\">Rejecting Specialization</a> to secure senior level projects you need to expose your vibes.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s important to have something <em>interesting</em> that you can talk about. My art startup is a great conversation starter - a lot of people are interested in art and culture. Just like lots of people are interested in Vicky’s food magazine.</p>",
  "<p>Launching a narrative aircover project that is inherently aligned with your passions will help ensure that people are paying attention, leaning in and taking your meetings.</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"3-unblocked-so-its-within-your-control\">3. Unblocked so it’s within your control</h3>",
  "<p>Finally, you want your narrative aircover project to be more under your own control than consulting work. One of the primary problems to solve is that you likely don’t currently have a lot of consulting work to rely on or talk about - you’re dependent on clients to move things forward.</p>",
  "<p>So you want your narrative aircover project to be <strong>alive by default</strong> - not blocked and relying on others to move forward but something that you can move forward under your own steam. Even a humble blog can fit the requirements here - free to publish as and when you want without any kind of gatekeepers or dependencies on others.</p>",
  "<p>In summary - indie consultants are creatures of momentum and narrative aircover is how you get started. It’s about creating activation energy in your network to start making something happen - because without that you’re going to just sit there and worry about finding clients.</p>",
  "<p>Narrative aircover isn’t about hiding our consulting identity - it’s about not leaning on it too hard during the early days when it’s most fragile and still evolving.</p>",
  "<p>Narrative aircover provides you meaning, labels, safety and permission to engage with people while you’re figuring things out during the first year or so of your journey.</p>",
  "<h1 id=\"part-2-compound-narrative\">Part 2: Compound Narrative</h1>",
  "<p>Eventually, at some point down the road you will successfully manage to generate revenue, find clients and build a consulting practice that <em>works</em> - your next problem is figuring out how to make it sustainable.</p>",
  "<p>Understandably - so much of your focus in the first few years of setting up your practice is on consistently generating clients. That is after all the most important thing you need. One client after another. Line em up.</p>",
  "<p>But at some point you can end up stuck - feeling like every client is simply another spin of the hamster wheel. Trapped in your own constraints of client work you’re feeling like there’s a never-ending series of client projects on the treadmill. A feeling that every client is starting from zero again.</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-14-57-47.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<div class=\"tc f5 i\">The never-ending treadmill of client work</div>",
  "<p>One of the biggest downsides of consulting is that there’s nothing passive about the revenue - nothing compounds. To pay rent each month you have to keep generating clients.</p>",
  "<p>This is why, once you reach some stability with consistently generating clients and revenue, many indie consultants begin to think about “scaling themselves” - either in the form of hiring staff or in building “passive income” products.</p>",
  "<p>This reflex isn’t bad per se but it’s important to recognize that they are avoiding the real problem. They are avoidance of dealing with the root issue of actually enjoying your consulting work. Of finding a way to value and enjoy client work over long periods of time.</p>",
  "<p>Some of the things we’ve talked about in the book can help you enjoy your work: shifting to strategic clients helps keep the work interesting and focusing on being impactful helps the work feel meaningful. But at some point it can start to feel like a grind.</p>",
  "<p>The problem is that outside of the constraints and norms of full time work, a defined career and job progression - there’s no simple measure for professional advancement.</p>",
  "<p>No one is paying for training, no one is sending you to conferences. No one is giving you a promotion or a new job title.</p>",
  "<p>So you have to find your own personal growth plan - a way to both find intrinsic meaning in growth and development and in externally visible progress towards being “more senior” and able to move upwards inside client organizations. Otherwise you’ll stagnate, your earnings will plateau and your public image will stall out.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"fitting-every-client-into-a-narrative-frame\">Fitting every client into a narrative frame</h2>",
  "<p>The trick here is to use each client as a compound build on the last one, not simply another go around the treadmill.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: In my own work - in year 2, after finding some routine in generating clients and steady work - a friend asked for advice on going out on their own, so I wrote up a blog post with some thoughts. That blog post generated a few more blog posts about the practice of independent consulting and before you know it I was writing this book (a project that would creatively sustain me with compound narrative for the next 6+ years!)</p>",
  "  <p>The trick is that every new client isn’t simply a chance to do the same thing but it’s a chance to deepen my perspective and experience on the practice of independent consulting. Every client can teach you something.</p>",
  "  <p>Now I gleefully look forward to new clients because I know they can become stories and examples for my book project.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>I call this idea <strong>compound narrative</strong>. You need some way to feel like every client builds on the last one - that you’re left starting from somewhere new, not starting from the same place every time.</p>",
  "<p>Then - the trick is to view every single client, no matter how “boring” or “routine” or “straightforward” on the surface - as being part of that compound narrative. What insights or evidence can you gather towards your questions through this client project?</p>",
  "<p>Niko Canner calls this “<a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade\">mastery of a larger game</a>”:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>The medium to do this larger work was in writing. In my prior chapter as a founder, building Katzenbach Partners, I’d never given myself much space to write, because that had never felt as important to my goals as the work of entrepreneurial leadership, rainmaking and advising clients. <strong>I needed to change that, and to recognize that writing would be my vehicle for reaching toward greater mastery of a larger game. Writing wasn’t in service of building an audience or building a business. Writing as a learning practice was an end in itself</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This might seem straightforward but the subtle trick is choosing a narrative frame that you’re <strong><em>actually interested in</em></strong>. For example, if you’re a digital PR consultant - the obvious learning frame for your work would be to learn about the practice of digital PR. Sure, this makes sense - except perhaps you’re not really interested in the idea of “digital PR” - it’s too broad and doesn’t have any kind of hook to it.</p>",
  "<p>The trick is to find a frame that lights up your curiosity - perhaps something like “how digital PR is evolving as new social platforms emerge” or “how companies measure the effectiveness of digital PR” or “why digital PR doesn’t get a seat at the executive table”.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"finding-the-right-learning-questions\">Finding the Right Learning Questions</h2>",
  "<p>Notice that these narrative frames are all open ended questions that possess a measure of <strong>specific curiosity</strong>. These narrative frames can be far more interesting by virtue of being more specific.</p>",
  "<p>Questions are powerful tools for shaping your thinking and perspective. Finding good questions can sustain and nourish your curiosity and help you feel alive. They’re the antidote to burnout and stagnation.</p>",
  "<p>But how do you find good questions?</p>",
  "<p>A great place to start is to write down a list of questions that you don’t know the answer to. Questions that might not even have an easy answer. Questions that you can explore over an extended period of time.</p>",
  "<p>The community Huddlecraft calls these <a href=\"https://medium.com/huddlecraft/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904\">learning questions</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.</p>",
  "  <p>Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.</p>",
  "  <p>Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>And they have this lovely 2x2 framework with examples of learning questions:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-15-00-51.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>This 2x2 framework feels right - if you write down 10 ideas for learning questions, you’ll be able to plot them (subjectively) on this 2x2 graph. It’s not that every single learning question needs to be impossible to answer and open ended, but those questions are going to be the ones with the most potential to nourish and sustain your practice for the longest.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: Behzod Sirjani is an independent consultant with a deep background in user research. To sustain his practice he has been researching and publishing OAE - a learning question around <a href=\"https://behzod.com/oae\">organizations as ecosystems</a>:</p>",
  "  <blockquote><br />    <p>“Organizations as Ecosystems” is a research and writing project about the ways that organizations sense, react, learn, and change. Some outputs of this project will be regular essays and a corresponding set of readings and references.</p><br />  </blockquote>",
  "  <p>This is a perfect open ended and impossible to fully answer. It’s easy to see how this question could sustain years of client work, where each client is an opportunity to explore and deepen your understanding of the question of how companies sense, react, learn and change.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Finding the right set of learning questions is incredibly powerful because it turns your consulting practice into a sustainable practice. It enables you to stay in the work for long multi-year periods. Because you have to stay in the work - if you’re an independent consultant there’s no one to do the work for you - no employees, no colleagues to lean on. So you have to stay in the work.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"compound-thinking--publishing\">Compound Thinking &amp; Publishing</h2>",
  "<p>The magical thing about finding questions you’re interested in and pursuing them for a while is that you end up with interesting things to say.</p>",
  "<p>As you deepen your understanding of the questions you’re interested in you find that these projects turn into generative and useful objects</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>For example, here’s John V Willshire back in 2015 talking about the famous “<a href=\"https://smithery.com/2015/01/07/three-2015-projects/\">Smithery Projects</a>” that he embarks on each year:</p>",
  "  <blockquote><br />    <p>“Ah, the famous annual Smithery projects. Well, famous might be pushing it, let’s go with ‘the thing that we do at the start of each year’. 2012 was about Making, 2013 was about Media, and 2014 was about Playing With Ideas, which in hindsight remained gloriously ill-defined but gave rise to August’s Culture Matrix malarkey, so we’ll let it off.”</p><br />  </blockquote>",
  "  <p>One of those projects eventually turned into a delightful foundational framework and approach called <a href=\"https://smithery.com/2020/12/01/starting-with-zenko-mapping/\">Zenko mapping</a> that is core to how Smithery operates.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>It’s part of why publishing is such a rich pursuit for indie consultants - it’s a culmination and focus on the act of <strong><em>accumulated insights</em></strong>. Turning your compound narrative into a published artefact is incredibly powerful - it positions you as an expert, builds an audience and is incredibly satisfying!</p>",
  "<p>There’s a rich vein of self-publishing by indie consultants:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The ux consultant writing <a href=\"https://4dthinking.studio/ux-book\">a book about UX design</a>.</li><br />  <li>The designer writing <a href=\"https://shapeofdesignbook.com/\">a book about design</a>.</li><br />  <li>The security consultant publishing <a href=\"https://www.spartan9.com/publications/crisis-simulations.html\">emergency extraction guides</a>.</li><br />  <li>The ethnographic researcher publishing <a href=\"https://www.thefieldstudyhandbook.com/\">the fieldguide to ethnographic research</a>.</li><br />  <li>The indie consultant publishing the book about independent consulting (coming soon!)</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>But it doesn’t have to be a book - publishing in all its forms can be an email newsletter, it can be a podcast, it can be a zine, it can be a research report.</p>",
  "<p>Any of these can work and in fact the ongoing nature of something like a podcast can help sustain an interest by becoming a vehicle not for promoting, but for learning! For <strong>continually being interested in the work you’re doing</strong>.</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/compound-learning.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>And if you do it all correctly, the sky’s the limit as April Dunford, author of Obviously Awesome, <a href=\"https://podcast.creatorscience.com/april-dunford/\">will testify</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“Getting the book out was absolutely transformational to the business. Like, that’s what took me from, this is a good business that pays me more than what my salary was in house, you know, yay me, consultant, to holy man. I didn’t even think it was possible to make this kind of money and work with this kind of clients and do this amazing stuff. And, yeah, the book was a game changer.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<h2 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h2>",
  "<p>The challenge of managing your own identity - free from any constraints and expectations of full time work - can be a surprising challenge. Realizing that you can be whoever you want to be comes with a sense of being untethered. Navigating that narrative journey requires anchoring ourselves to things - whether it’s narrative aircover of a self-directed project or the compound narrative of learning questions.</p>",
  "<p>And eventually, once you find a generative set of questions to explore, it can sustain an independent consulting practice for years - helping you generate interesting clients, enjoy every new client and build a sense of personal growth and progression.</p><br />"

  "<p>There are many indie consultants that like the lifestyle and freedoms it affords, but don’t actually love the client work itself - but I’ve worked so hard over the last 9 years to both attract the right kinds of clients and to hone my approach to working with clients that client work energizes me and lights me up.</p>",

  "<p>At one point I think I felt like perhaps my consulting chapter was waning or winding down as I focused on courses and whatnot. But this conversation with clients is too deeply rooted. I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years. You have no idea how exciting that is to write.</p>",
  "<p>What did consulting work look like this year? Here’s a few vignettes:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>After reading Cedric’s blog post series on <a href=\"https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/\">becoming more data driven</a> and in particular the Amazon Weekly Business Review - I worked with a long term client to create a Monthly Business Review (MBR) packet that has a TON of charts and data in it. The CEO now carries it around with him at all times - scribbling notes in the margins and I love it.</li><br />  <li>As mentioned last year - most of my work is now <strong><em>P&amp;L first</em></strong> which really means that the primary context I’m considering work through is a resource-constrained and financial perspective. This is a continuation of the idea that’s powered my entire consulting career: how to do effective consulting work. Good ideas are worthless if you can’t get them done.</li><br />  <li>Working with <a href=\"https://directiveconsulting.com/\">Directive Consulting</a> on their branding and positioning was very rewarding - Garrett the CEO is an amazing operator with a deep understanding of his own P&amp;L and this positioning work wasn’t just words, it was designed to change the whole delivery cycle from marketing and sales through to operations.</li><br />  <li>I dabbled with some executive coaching - but the biggest realization here is that I’m too much of a consultant to be a pure coach - I want to be like a performance coach, working directly with individuals and executive teams on management performance. My ideal client would be running a management team weekly meeting - getting more operational than coaching typically allows.</li><br />  <li>Surprisingly, I’ve ended up integrating design work into my consulting offering. I’ve ended up designing new page templates, product experiences, landing pages, keynote presentations and more. Design isn’t the main thing people are paying me for but I’m starting to take design more seriously as as thing that I can deliver as part of a strategic project.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Looking ahead to the new year - obviously AI is going to dominate the conversation. I’m involved in a few very interesting client projects around AI and it feels like clients are finally starting to realize they need to get started, you can’t hang around waiting for others to figure it out for you…</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"from-seo-mba---new-mba\">From SEO MBA -&gt; NEW MBA</h2>",
  "<p>At the start of the year I ran a live cohort for the SEO MBA. It was…. fine? The people that went through the experience absolutely loved it, but the cohort was smaller than I wanted it to be and I overloaded the schedule so it was quite exhausting to run.</p>",
  "<p>Partly because of this and partly because of a general desire to broaden and expand the ideas in the SEO MBA I went into hibernation mode. Out of that emerged a new idea - it’s an evolution of the SEO MBA brand, but designed for a much broader audience:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/newmba-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://newmba.co/\">NEW MBA</a> is already deeply rewarding and generative. The ability to sit with ideas around business, management and leadership that I’ve been playing around with on the SEO MBA is very exciting. The aspiration here is to reach a much bigger audience with the ideas - and to align the writing and courses more directly with my consulting work.</p>",
  "<p>There aren’t (yet) any courses and classes on the NEW MBA but all of that is coming this year so watch this space. Just like my consulting, I think I can commit to the NEW MBA idea for the next 20 years.</p>",
  "<p>This project is live, but actually is in a kind of “soft launch” state - because there’s something I’ve gotta do first….</p>",

Roxy is now a committed Taylor Swift fan and I love it.</li><br />  <li>Indy is now 4 and really coming into his own with personality, pizazz and a deep love of Ninjago lego.</li><br />  <li>Instead of putting the kids in summer camp we took an extended European vacation as a family, taking almost 7 weeks off. This is the first year that both kids are officially in school schedules and it’s weird to start to think about every year having a specific “shape” - of summer holidays, school dates and more.</li><br />  <li>I took three week-long work trips and.. this was too much. The projects were <em>exactly</em> the kind of projects I want to work on, but I’ve got to find clients in NYC (or at least the east coast!) that I can work with in this capacity.</li><br /></ul>",

During a transition, it can seem like nothing is happening, or too much is happening, or somehow both simultaneously. Often someone in the middle of a transition experiences a lot of pressure, both internally and from kin, to stop fucking around and get on with it.

  "<p>This is much harder to do though when you feel the slightest money stress and despite the strong year I felt some anxiety around that in the second half of the year as consulting dried up. This happens <em>every single time</em> I get quiet with consulting… You would think after 9 years I would have learned to trust the process by now, but with all the tech industry layoffs and tough economic climate it wasn’t hard to feel some economic anxiety.</p>",
  "<p>Ultimately, the most powerful thing was working with my executive coach (thank you Sunil). It really helped remind me <em>why</em> I was working on the various projects I was - how they fit together and why they’re important to me.</p>",
  "<p>I’d also like to give a massive shoutout to Paul Millerd for both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6flh_06Rtk&amp;ab_channel=PaulMillerd\">having me on his podcast to talk about being stuck</a> as well as being an absolute massive champion and energizing for getting my book finished (more on the book in a second).</p>",
  "<p>Would I call myself unstuck now? I think I would. Launching the NEW MBA I think was the final puzzle piece that allowed me to feel free to move and play again.</p>",

  "<h2 id=\"i-just-fing-love-consulting\">I just f*(&amp;^)ing LOVE consulting</h2>",
  "<p>One of the things that emerged out of my work with my executive coach was a reminder that I really, truly love consulting work.</p>",
  "<p>There are many indie consultants that like the lifestyle and freedoms it affords, but don’t actually love the client work itself - but I’ve worked so hard over the last 9 years to both attract the right kinds of clients and to hone my approach to working with clients that client work energizes me and lights me up.</p>",
  "<p>More please, I love it.</p>",
  "<p>At the root of this is the idea of consulting being a <strong>conversation with clients</strong>. Niko Canner articulates this beautifully in his piece:</p>",

Those were practices to deepen every day.</p><br /><footer>@humanenterprise <cite><a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade\">https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>At one point I think I felt like perhaps my consulting chapter was waning or winding down as I focused on courses and whatnot. But this conversation with clients is too deeply rooted. I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years. You have no idea how exciting that is to write.</p>",
  "<p>What did consulting work look like this year? Here’s a few vignettes:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>After reading Cedric’s blog post series on <a href=\"https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/\">becoming more data driven</a> and in particular the Amazon Weekly Business Review - I worked with a long term client to create a Monthly Business Review (MBR) packet that has a TON of charts and data in it. The CEO now carries it around with him at all times - scribbling notes in the margins and I love it.</li><br />  <li>As mentioned last year - most of my work is now <strong><em>P&amp;L first</em></strong> which really means that the primary context I’m considering work through is a resource-constrained and financial perspective. This is a continuation of the idea that’s powered my entire consulting career: how to do effective consulting work. Good ideas are worthless if you can’t get them done.</li><br />  <li>Working with <a href=\"https://directiveconsulting.com/\">Directive Consulting</a> on their branding and positioning was very rewarding - Garrett the CEO is an amazing operator with a deep understanding of his own P&amp;L and this positioning work wasn’t just words, it was designed to change the whole delivery cycle from marketing and sales through to operations.</li><br />  <li>I dabbled with some executive coaching - but the biggest realization here is that I’m too much of a consultant to be a pure coach - I want to be like a performance coach, working directly with individuals and executive teams on management performance. My ideal client would be running a management team weekly meeting - getting more operational than coaching typically allows.</li><br />  <li>Surprisingly, I’ve ended up integrating design work into my consulting offering. I’ve ended up designing new page templates, product experiences, landing pages, keynote presentations and more. Design isn’t the main thing people are paying me for but I’m starting to take design more seriously as as thing that I can deliver as part of a strategic project.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Looking ahead to the new year - obviously AI is going to dominate the conversation. I’m involved in a few very interesting client projects around AI and it feels like clients are finally starting to realize they need to get started, you can’t hang around waiting for others to figure it out for you…</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"from-seo-mba---new-mba\">From SEO MBA -&gt; NEW MBA</h2>",
  "<p>At the start of the year I ran a live cohort for the SEO MBA. It was…. fine? The people that went through the experience absolutely loved it, but the cohort was smaller than I wanted it to be and I overloaded the schedule so it was quite exhausting to run.</p>",
  "<p>Partly because of this and partly because of a general desire to broaden and expand the ideas in the SEO MBA I went into hibernation mode. Out of that emerged a new idea - it’s an evolution of the SEO MBA brand, but designed for a much broader audience:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/newmba-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://newmba.co/\">NEW MBA</a> is already deeply rewarding and generative. The ability to sit with ideas around business, management and leadership that I’ve been playing around with on the SEO MBA is very exciting. The aspiration here is to reach a much bigger audience with the ideas - and to align the writing and courses more directly with my consulting work.</p>",
  "<p>There aren’t (yet) any courses and classes on the NEW MBA but all of that is coming this year so watch this space. Just like my consulting, I think I can commit to the NEW MBA idea for the next 20 years.</p>",
  "<p>This project is live, but actually is in a kind of “soft launch” state - because there’s something I’ve gotta do first….</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-winter-of-word-craft-the-book-is-coming\">A Winter of Word Craft: The book is coming!</h2>",
  "<p>My close friend Brian created a little book of collected testimonials and blurbs for my book and handed it to me on my 40th birthday party. It floored me. I cried. You are the best Brian. And thank you to everyone who included a blurb. The overwhelming support for the book is a real driving force and I love you all.</p>",
  "<p>The good news is that <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/\">the book</a> is coming! I’ve been jamming with fellow indie consultant Tim Casasola on the outline and structure for the book and I think I’m finally arrived at somewhere I’m happy with. But/and I’ve realized that actually getting this book over the finishing line is going to require a period of focused effort and dedication.</p>",
  "<p>My good friend Toby wrote an incredibly moving and lovely December note where he talked about naming seasons and intention setting:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Reflections%20on%202023\" data-author=\"Toby Shorin\" cite=\"https://buttondown.email/tobyshorin/archive/reflections-on-2023/\"><br />Winter is upon us now, and I don't have a name for this season yet. But December and winter for me is always dream season, so perhaps I will call it that. Winter is for reflecting and clarifying, and dreams are for knowing and for inventing—for we know in part, and we prophesy in part. I have recommended to you the benefits of dreaming, and of naming your seasons. I hope that you join me in the great experiment.<br /><footer>@buttondown <cite><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/tobyshorin/archive/reflections-on-2023/\">https://buttondown.email/tobyshorin/archive/reflections-on-2023/</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>So I’m dedicating this season to the <strong>Winter of Word Craft</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>To say that another way - on the first day of Spring I will be done with the book.</p>",
  "<p>Thanks to Paul Millerd and Erica Heinz for countless self-publishing questions AND emotional support and encouragement. They’ve both put incredible and beautiful self-published books out in the world and I’m grateful for both of them.</p>",
