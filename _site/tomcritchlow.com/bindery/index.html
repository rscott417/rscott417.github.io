        <div class="post-content">
        <p>In this post I want to break down what I mean by ‚Äústrategic independent‚Äù and why, whatever path you‚Äôre on and expertise you have, you can bring more value for yourself and your clients by thinking strategically.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll walk through:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What strategic work is</strong> - by looking at a variety of contexts you might work within and how to spot them.</li>
  <li><strong>Why strategic work is better</strong> - both for you and the client, offering more value to them and being more interesting for you.</li>
  <li><strong>How strategic work enables you to charge more</strong> - and keep clients retained for longer, a compounding effect on your ability to charge more.</li>
  <li><strong>How you can begin to think strategically</strong> - offering some real examples from my own career.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, how being independent offers more value for your clients by enabling you to gain adjacent context that your client might not be able to see and that we get this adjacent from our network - and therefore we should really think of being codependent with our network.</p>

<p>Onwards‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="strategic-work-is-work-in-context">Strategic work is work-in-context</h2>

<p>Client work can be frustrating:</p>

<p><em>Ever had a project cancelled without notice?</em></p>

<p><em>Ever had to go through endless revisions and feel like you‚Äôre not getting it?</em></p>

<p><em>Ever had a project stall before it even started because you can‚Äôt agree on the exact deliverables?</em></p>

<p><em>Ever had a piece of work never get implemented by a client?</em></p>

<p>But frustration is a two player game - when you‚Äôre frustrated that work doesn‚Äôt make sense - the client is likely frustrated that your work doesn‚Äôt meet their objectives well enough.</p>

<p>Context is the key.</p>

<p>Even before I start working with a client in the very first meeting I always make sure I ask questions about business model, team structure, company priorities and more. These don‚Äôt always feel relevant to the specific request but help me better map out both the work I need to do and the stakeholders that need to see it.</p>

<p>The more you understand an organization the better you can understand context<sup id="fnref:wayseeing"><a href="#fn:wayseeing" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="overlapping-contexts">Overlapping contexts</h2>

<p>So when I talk about strategic work - it‚Äôs about trying to understand the concentric circles of context at any time. For example - if you‚Äôre designing an app for a company the app might sit within a variety of business contexts<sup id="fnref:obvious"><a href="#fn:obvious" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/context1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>However, in addition to the above context - that app design project might <em>also</em> exist within a variety of people contexts:</p>

<p><img src="/images/context2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every project exists in multiple overlapping contexts - here‚Äôs some of the types of context to look for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>People (who are the stakeholders? what do they care about?)</li>
  <li>Resources (what can they realistically <em>do</em> with your work?)</li>
  <li>Brand (what is the position of the company?)</li>
  <li>Marketing (audiences, channels, analytics)</li>
  <li>Business model (revenue, profit)</li>
  <li>Product (how does their product work, what is possible?)</li>
  <li>The user (who is the user? What do they care about?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your work likely overlaps at least partly with all of these ideas - but also depending on your specific work you might have different contexts and add more nuance.</p>

<h2 id="strategic-work-is-better-work">Strategic work is better work</h2>

<p>Once you understand the concentric circles within which your work happens you‚Äôll be able do work that‚Äôs more effective and useful for your clients.</p>

<p>Two examples from my own work:</p>

<div class="example">

  <p><strong>Example #1</strong></p>

  <p>I was working as a marketing advisor for a client and early in the engagement (partly because we were discussing me becoming the full-time CMO) I was invited to sit in on their quarterly board meeting. This experience was formative in better understanding the drivers and motivations of the business - by understanding who literally owned the business better. This context was crucial for proposing work and for ensuring that pitching that work to the board was smooth. The CEO gave me some of the necessary context but by attending that board meeting I got a vantage point that I didn‚Äôt realize existed previously.</p>

  <p><strong>Example #2</strong></p>

  <p>Last year I was working with a client to integrate an acquisition into the main business - in particular to ensure that one business function was working correctly. My north star and most of the language in the team was about revenue projections for the function. Makes sense. But, I discovered that actually the SVP‚Äôs OKR for the quarter was ensuring that the business unit was functioning smoothly. While revenue was obviously a thing that they cared about, the more important context was around process and communication around that process. Once I had this context everything became easier since I could be more closely aligned with the objectives of the business.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="catastrophic-events--context-collapse">Catastrophic Events &amp; Context Collapse</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs a certain kind of experience that I want to describe where everything goes to shit. Certain events in business collapse the environment. For example - let‚Äôs take that context model for app design from earlier in the post. But let‚Äôs assume that the growth objectives are ‚Äúin crisis‚Äù - this could be missing targets, people change, overspend, change in marketing strategy etc</p>

<p><strong>These catastrophic events collapse the environment and cascade downwards</strong>. Every circle inside gets ignored, paused, cancelled, changed, redefined. These events are felt like system-shock for anyone operating in these lower circles</p>

<p><img src="/images/catastrophic-context.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But for those above the fire-line there are two things that are crucial:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Their objectives and priorities haven‚Äôt changed much, they‚Äôre still operating within the same context they were previously (although they may feel some turbulence)</li>
  <li><strong>They likely knew about the catastrophic event ahead of time</strong>. They may even have been responsible for causing the catastrophic event.</li>
</ol>

<p>We‚Äôve likely all been personally inside a context as it collapses - either as a full time employee or a consultant / agency partner. It‚Äôs not fun.</p>

<p>Riding these crashes is a skill that I think in theory you can get good at - learning how to sprint at a moments notice in a new direction and operate supernaturally fast in a crashing environment.</p>

<p>But I think it‚Äôs way easier to instead always be searching upwards for more context awareness - i.e. working strategically. This helps you ride out those catastrophic events with more planning, awareness and foresight.</p>

<h2 id="strategic-work-is-better-paid">Strategic work is better paid</h2>

<p>In addition to being better work (for clients and for you) - strategic work is also better paid.</p>

<p>As an independent - you‚Äôll hear a lot of advice boil down to ‚Äúcharge more‚Äù. I‚Äôve even said it myself! And it‚Äôs true - it‚Äôs the best advice you can get. Except‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kind of empty advice. I don‚Äôt think it provides much direction for how exactly you go about doing it.</p>

<p>Translating executional work into strategic work is a framework that I think gives concrete ways of continually ratcheting up the price &amp; value of your work.</p>

<p>The key idea is that at every layer of context there are new kinds of work - and by reaching for associated layers of context you can get involved in new kinds of work that are associated with and grounded in the thing you know but also a slight stretch.</p>

<p>Not only can you charge more because the work is more useful, impactful and better but you can also charge for the associated parts of uncovering context - workshops, user research, competitive analysis, stakeholder interviews etc.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at two examples:</p>

<h3 id="scenario-1---from-writing-to-strategic-writing">Scenario #1 - From Writing to Strategic Writing</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine you‚Äôre a writer - commissioned to write for a client‚Äôs branded content site. Let‚Äôs say you get paid $200 per article. The work: writing. How might we think of writing-in-context? Here‚Äôs a list of context that you should ask for and where it‚Äôs not available or it‚Äôs done poorly offer to step in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a style guide for all the writers</li>
  <li>User research for end users to uncover what they want to read (e.g. by creating personas)</li>
  <li>Competitive analysis for other branded content sites, who writes for them and how they operate</li>
  <li>A content marketing plan for the branded content site</li>
  <li>A content marketing plan across the whole brand</li>
  <li>Themed content franchises that can scale beyond individual posts</li>
  <li>SEO research into keywords they care about targeting</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="scenario-2---from-ux-research-to-strategic-research">Scenario #2 - From UX Research to Strategic Research</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine you‚Äôre a UX researcher - creating user research from real users for clients. The work: creating user research projects, finding relevant users and running them. This is likely reasonably well-paid work as-is but let‚Äôs look at ways we might take this UX-research and place it in-context:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating a set of product principles based off user research</li>
  <li>Reviewing a product roadmap</li>
  <li>Running a design sprint internally to ideate new product ideas (grounded in user research experience of course)</li>
  <li>Proposing a broader marketing focus group study</li>
</ul>

<p>Some more examples of how work and associated context work might fit together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work: email copywriter -&gt; context: brand voice document</li>
  <li>Work: paid marketing -&gt; context: paid marketing dashboard creation</li>
  <li>Work: marketing strategy -&gt; context: hiring a marketing team</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôve got a very loose working theory that every time you expand your context-circles you get paid an order of magnitude more money.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not unreasonable to imagine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writing: $200 / article</li>
  <li>Style guide: $2,000</li>
  <li>Content strategy: $20,000</li>
</ul>

<p>These are necessarily imperfect analogies and will vary wildly from industry to industry<sup id="fnref:contextexamples"><a href="#fn:contextexamples" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, but here‚Äôs a specific callout as you start to bundle ‚Äúthe work‚Äù and ‚Äúthe context‚Äù:</p>

<p><strong>Don‚Äôt give the context work away for free. In fact, do the opposite - charge more for it than your regular work.</strong></p>

<p>I see this often with more junior or less confident independents - you‚Äôre trying to close ‚Äúthe work‚Äù and so you throw in ‚Äúthe context‚Äù for free or as a sweetener.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt do this! Work-in-context is typically more expensive than regular work so don‚Äôt be afraid to price it separately and confidently. Don‚Äôt worry if the client doesn‚Äôt bite at first - strategic work is only valuable at certain inflection points (see below graphs) but they‚Äôll remember that you offered it and it‚Äôll come back around.</p>

<h2 id="strategy-and-stewardship---a-framework-for-retaining-clients-for-a-long-time">Strategy and Stewardship - a framework for retaining clients for a long time</h2>

<p>So we‚Äôve established that you can get paid more money for strategic work - and now I want to show you that the new higher rates you‚Äôre charging can also last longer. A compounding effect on your pricing power.</p>

<p>I learned about the model of Strategy &amp; Stewardship from the <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/">Helsinki Design Lab</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is common these days for one group to be involved in analysis of a problem and designing the solution (consultants) while a different group executes these ideas (contractors). But this disconnects an essential feedback loop<sup id="fnref:recipes"><a href="#fn:recipes" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their solution? Strategy and stewardship:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We invoke stewardship in place of words like ‚Äúimplement‚Äù and ‚Äúexecute‚Äù out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly. What we describe also goes well beyond ‚Äúfacilitation,‚Äù which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role. Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you‚Äôre a natural steward<sup id="fnref:legileb"><a href="#fn:legileb" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea of a feedback loop between strategy and implementation is one I‚Äôve taken to heart. It maps directly to my mental model of a typical long-term retained client relationship.</p>

<p>Imagine a 12-month client retainer with the strategic work in green and the implementation in blue:</p>

<p><img src="/images/strategy-execution.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see that (roughly) the total amount of work is constant but there is a phase shift from strategy at the beginning to mostly execution &amp; implementation (stewardship) and then a hard shift back into strategic work.</p>

<p>If you look at strategy on its own:</p>

<p><img src="/images/strategy-only.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are two key things to draw from this chart:</p>

<p><strong>The long-term work begins with strategic work</strong>, so if you want to get involved in a project early (a common request) you have to be thinking and working strategically.</p>

<p>But importantly, <strong>if you only do strategy work the client isn‚Äôt going to keep you around for months 3-12</strong>.  No matter how lucrative that strategy work is, if you‚Äôre not shifting your outputs to implementation/stewardship then there isn‚Äôt enough work for either you or the client to justify sticking around and so you end up with a short sprint of a project.</p>

<p>Now, if you look at execution on it‚Äôs own:</p>

<p><img src="/images/execution-only.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are two key drawbacks to only doing implementation/execution work:</p>

<p>Firstly - notice how the blue line shoots up a few months into the project? <strong>When you‚Äôre only working on the execution/implementation you get called into the project too late</strong> - the strategy is already set.</p>

<p>Secondly - notice how <strong>at some point in the future, the client either pauses, reviews or changes their strategy and the project unexpectedly ends</strong>? This can seem like it ‚Äúcomes out of nowhere‚Äù if you‚Äôre only doing the execution work and not aware of the wider context.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-stewardship-work-look-like">So what does stewardship work look like?</h2>

<p>So what is stewardship exactly? Sometimes it‚Äôs literally just rolling up your sleeves to do the work outlined in the strategy. Never underestimate how powerful a single reference piece of work can be - e.g. you want the editorial team to produce 1000s of pieces of content over the next 12 months - but if you create the gold standard piece of content it can get referenced again and again and become the inspiration for a whole team.</p>

<p>So is the execution just plugging away in the trenches? Yes sometimes, but I think the most powerful stewardship work is around momentum - helping the organization or project accelerate their output. Some examples from my own work for things that look like stewardship:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiring &amp; building teams</li>
  <li>Building workstreams, processes</li>
  <li>Building dashboards and reporting templates</li>
  <li>Adding partnerships and relationships</li>
</ul>

<p>If you take this strategy &amp; stewardship approach - when the client comes to review the strategy at month 6 you‚Äôre still there working with the client and able to offer tangible and concrete insights into the work. How is the strategy evolving? Where should we adjust? What have we achieved?</p>

<p><strong>Using this approach the average retainer length for clients I work with is 20 months.</strong></p>

<p>I recall an important breakthrough for my own thinking - a client had hired another consultant to work on a project and afterwards I asked my client how the experience was and he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIt was fine - but he just gave advice. I like working with you because you‚Äôre not afraid to roll up your sleeves and do the work when it needs doing‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a real lightbulb moment for me - up until that time I‚Äôd always worried about doing ‚Äúmenial‚Äù or ‚Äúlow-paid‚Äù work as a consultant but charging a strategy-based day-rate.</p>

<p>But the thing I realized was that if you can provide momentum to an organization it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre writing title tags in an SEO environment or putting together a board pitch: <strong>you should do the most valuable thing the business needs at that moment</strong>.</p>

<p>The freedom of a consultant is that you can ignore job title / role / responsibility and be laser focused on moving the business towards key objectives and mixing your outputs from small to big as needed.</p>

<p>So, don‚Äôt undervalue either part of your work - either the strategy or the stewardship. Remember that graph up above with the blue/green strategy/execution mix? I bill it all at the same day rate. Stewardship is just as valuable as strategy and there‚Äôs no reason to somehow charge less for the execution work.</p>

<h2 id="only-let-clients-in-the-strategy-door">Only let clients in the strategy door</h2>

<p>So we‚Äôve established that the combination of strategy &amp; stewardship is important - but there‚Äôs a crucial note to make:</p>

<p><strong>Clients that come to you <em>only</em> for implementation are going to be your worst clients.</strong></p>

<p>Wait what? Haven‚Äôt I been telling you to get your hands dirty? Yes, but‚Ä¶</p>

<p>In his book the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Business-Expertise-Entrepreneurial-Experts-Convert-ebook/dp/B07B7DFP1B/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=expertise&amp;qid=1553871197&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">business of expertise</a> in chapter 10 titled ‚ÄúDistinguishing expertise from implementation‚Äù David Baker uses the great analogy of a building with two connected rooms and two entrances, one for strategy and one for execution.</p>

<p>The whole chapter is a delight and the punchline is: ‚Äúonly let clients in the strategy door‚Äù:</p>

<p><img src="/images/david-baker.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The argument really boils down to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implementation work is hard work to sell - you get poor quality clients expecting a more easily commoditized output that drives your business towards lower margins</li>
  <li>Not only that but implementation work is often more stressful and deadline-driven</li>
  <li>So of course do both for clients but only let them in through the strategy door to ensure that you do better, higher value and higher margin work.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should really <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B7DFP1B/">buy the book</a> - it‚Äôs a fast read but has lots of pieces of wisdom<sup id="fnref:david"><a href="#fn:david" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Importantly - if you accept that you can do a lot of implementation work for clients but they should all start with strategy then your external positioning should be entirely focused around the strategy work to attract the right kinds of clients.</p>

<h2 id="time--money">Time &amp; Money</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a funny thing - when you read the accepted literature about pricing as an independent you‚Äôll hear again and again that pricing based on time is a <a href="https://ryanwaggoner.com/freelance-rate-mistake/">bad thing</a><sup id="fnref:timemoney"><a href="#fn:timemoney" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. And, maybe they‚Äôre right - but I‚Äôve had plenty of success charging on a loosely-coupled time-based approach (almost all of my work is scoped at a day rate, at least to begin with).</p>

<p><strong>I have a theory that this time-based approach to pricing is especially powerful as you move through a context-transition.</strong></p>

<p>Why? Well - as you go through this cycle of exposure to new contexts and working in new contexts you are by definition operating in new types of work and new types of environments and it‚Äôs hard to control the inputs and outputs.</p>

<p>Put simply - as you ladder up into wider contexts for your work you don‚Äôt yet have enough experience to properly scope and price the work - not to mention you may be continually expanding your context not upwards but sideways into new types of workstreams.</p>

<p>So I say - if you‚Äôre reading the commonly accepted wisdom about pricing and feeling like <em>you‚Äôre doing it wrong</em> by pricing based on time let me tell you that <em>you‚Äôre totally fine</em> and that strategic work by definition can be fuzzy and so scoping on project work can be dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="my-own-journey-out-of-seo">My own journey out of SEO</h2>

<p>Looking back at my career - this idea of doing work-in-context has determined the path I‚Äôve taken from SEO manager to digital strategy to consulting work.</p>

<p>The problem with SEO is that it‚Äôs inherently non-strategic. As an activity it‚Äôs increasingly commoditized and marginalized. Not that SEO-traffic is not important or that SEO is going away, but that the strategic activities you undertake to achieve business-level goals are usually not owned by SEO practitioners or agencies<sup id="fnref:seo"><a href="#fn:seo" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This wasn‚Äôt always true - there was a golden age of ~2008-2012 where an SEO agency could get directly in front of the CMO to work on digital strategy. Back in 2011 when I worked at Distilled it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to be working directly on digital strategy for fortune-500 brands, in a context model that looked something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/seo-context-old.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>But I could see the writing on the wall and could feel the shift as everyone else in digital ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù to the competencies and experience that the SEO industry had built up over the previous decade to the point where a more traditional SEO engagement now looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/seo-context-new.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I felt this shift towards SEO being less strategic I needed to find ways to expand my context and work in different types of work more directly and explicitly.</p>

<p>When I first started consulting in 2014, yes I worked mostly on SEO projects. But I was keenly aware of the wider context and pushed myself to ask questions and be curious - whether about the business model or the teams executing the work.</p>

<p>Over time - by asking questions and pushing for more context I was able to start to get involved in several different wider context-circles and evolve the work I do<sup id="fnref:mediadesign"><a href="#fn:mediadesign" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-learn-to-be-more-strategic">How to learn to be more strategic</h2>

<p>Taking my personal SEO example above it‚Äôs hard to overstate the importance and value of being curious. Being curious about the industry you‚Äôre in and how it works, being curious about the clients you‚Äôre working for and being curious about the context of your own work is where this whole strategic independent path starts.</p>

<p>Then, from there the path to strategic work looks something like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ask questions and be curious (about the business, the industry, the people)</li>
  <li>Explicitly ask to see surrounding context (e.g. as a writer, ask for the content strategy, as a marketer ask for the strategic roadmap)</li>
  <li>Then, next time explicitly ask to be included in the creation of the surrounding context</li>
  <li>Then, start offering and leading the projects to add the surrounding context</li>
  <li>Repeat as you expand your context</li>
</ol>

<p>Here‚Äôs a worked example from my own experience on ‚Äúhow to be more strategic‚Äù as I learned about brand positioning work for clients:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step was being curious about brand positioning - how does it work? What does it look like? I got exposed to a handful of these kinds of projects at Google and always asked questions</li>
  <li>The second step is to keep your ear close to the ground and ask to be involved in a brand positioning workshop or project as it‚Äôs happening - just as an observer / participant.</li>
  <li>The third step is to spot opportunities for where a brand positioning project would make sense and add value and source a partner to help with the work for a client - where I‚Äôm leading and owning the work output but working with a partner.</li>
  <li>The fourth step is creating and running a brand positioning project on my own for a client (probably smaller to begin with while I gain confidence).</li>
</ol>

<p>This explicit evolution and experience in my own work probably took 3-4 years with the help of some friends but is exactly that ladder of context-awareness that enables you to get involved in strategic work.</p>

<p>As you can see, this path to strategic work relies on gaining context from client work - but there‚Äôs another way to gain context - from your network.</p>

<h2 id="the-adjacent-context-benefit-of-independence">The adjacent-context benefit of independence</h2>

<p>Most of this post focuses on the idea of context as gathered from your client and their business - but there‚Äôs another great source of context: peers.</p>

<p>Co-dependence is really the right word for independence<sup id="fnref:frank"><a href="#fn:frank" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. I‚Äôve talked a lot about the power of the network - both as a tool for gathering leads for your business but also as an emotional support network.</p>

<p>Frank Chimero wrote a wonderful essay I think about often titled <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/the-inferno-of-independence/">the inferno of independence</a> which is hard to boil down but looks at the nature of independent work - and articulates this shift from independence to co-dependence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Listen: we only deserve what we can maintain and keep safe. A community is only as good as how well it takes care of all its members. There is no independence. There is only subservience or co-dependence. And I choose you. I choose community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Co-dependence and network building has plenty of other benefits<sup id="fnref:strange"><a href="#fn:strange" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> but one key benefit of a diverse network is the adjacent-context. <strong>Some of the most helpful context you bring to your clients as an independent is the context they would otherwise not have access to or overlook</strong>.</p>

<p>Adjacent context is thinking laterally about an industry, organization or problem - looking sideways for unusual or unexpected analogies or insights into expanding contexts that might not be obvious to you or your clients. You can only get this from hanging around a blend of interesting people who are also context-aware.</p>

<p>So then, the strategic independent is someone who not only helps bridge context inside an organization but outside as well. This distance from a client‚Äôs organization is extremely valuable - and yet another reason not to undersell the value of context before and during an engagement. Someone able to connect the dots and do work-in-context but also expand the context into new directions.</p>

<h2 id="will-you-join-me-on-the-path-to-being-a-strategic-independent">Will you join me on the path to being a strategic independent?</h2>

<p>Hopefully this long post was helpful - let‚Äôs recap the main points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work-in-context is more rewarding &amp; more effective for you and the client</li>
  <li>It also allows you to charge for additional types of work! Hence making you better paid</li>
  <li>But it also allows you to work with clients over a long time-horizon, extending the length of your client contracts (a compounding effect on revenue when combined with charging more)</li>
  <li>As you begin to shift to strategic work - start to only let clients ‚Äúin the strategy door‚Äù - you‚Äôll get better clients this way</li>
  <li>Learning how to be strategic is relatively straight forward (even if it takes a while) by constantly looking for additional context</li>
  <li>And, as you work in fluid context-shifting client work don‚Äôt be afraid to charge based on time - despite what the received wisdom advises.</li>
  <li>Finally as an independent remember that co-dependence with your network is actually the ideal state and you can gain context from peers just as much as you can from clients</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm writing a book. Originally it was designed for ‚Äúindependent consultants‚Äù and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs still an audience. But I realized writing this post that the audience is wider - I‚Äôm writing not just for those doing ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù or even ‚Äústrategy work‚Äù but also designers, writers, researchers, leaders who are doing <strong>strategic work, independently - the strategic independent</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="sectiontitle bookgreen" id="section2">2. Finding Work</h2>
    <p class="sectiondescription"><em>The number one problem most independent consultants face is finding clients. The default mode of searching for "productized services" however is usually wrong. Instead we need to increase our presence across the networks we're surrounded by.</em></p>
        
        

        
        
        
        <h1 class="posttitle" id="section2chapter1">Small-b Blogging</h1>
        <h2 class="postsubtitle">Network topology and the ghost of the digg homepage</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>There‚Äôs an idea that starting a blog is harder than it used to be. That there used to be a way to write a few words, slap it online and wait for the traffic to roll in.</p>

<p>I call BS. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs not true exactly - but that kind of thinking is living in the shadow of the Digg homepage.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd like to propose a new mental model for blogging - <strong>small b blogging</strong>. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

<p>Middle of last year I wrote one of my most widely read blog posts - <a href="http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/">the consultant‚Äôs grain</a>. Checking analytics I see that it has 2500 lifetime pageviews. It‚Äôs not nothing but as one of my ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù posts it‚Äôs a small audience by anyone‚Äôs measure.</p>

<p>And yet. That single post has directly led to two podcast appearances, at least one client, several coffee meetings with other independent consultants and more interesting conversations than I can remember.</p>

<p>This post - <a href="http://tomcritchlow.com/2017/01/26/f-yeah-side-projects/">f* yeah side projects</a> - has 1,614 lifetime pageviews. But was included in two email newsletters from people I respect, created at least one interesting coffee meeting and, perhaps most importantly, is a story I re-tell often and use as a fable for folks asking for career and interview advice.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs going on here? I call it small b blogging. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle of making interesting connections while also being a way to clarify and strengthen my own ideas. I‚Äôm not reaching a big audience by any measure but the direct impact and benefit is material.</p>

<p>Small b blogging is learning to write and think <em>with</em> the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most ‚Äúcontent marketing‚Äù.</p>

<p>And remember that you are your own audience! Small b blogging is writing things that you link back to and reference time and time again. Ideas that can evolve and grow as your thinking and audience grows.</p>

<p>As Venkatesh says in <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/08/19/the-calculus-of-grit/">the calculus of grit</a> - <strong>release</strong> work often, <strong>reference</strong> your own thinking &amp; <strong>rework</strong> the same ideas again and again. That‚Äôs the small b blogging model.</p>

<h2 id="blogging-isnt-dead-but-the-network-topology-has-changed">Blogging isn‚Äôt dead but the network topology has changed</h2>

<p>How does small b blogging go against the traditional mental model of blogging?</p>

<p>Digg used to be the homepage of the internet (back when it was an aggregator, and before reddit became the new Digg). This was a time when there were a small number of entry points to the network that controlled a huge amount of influence. The Digg homepage, Hacker News, Slashdot, Metafilter. <a name="small-b"></a></p>

<p>Crucially, these entry points to the network were <strong>very big and very accessible</strong>. What do I mean by that? Well - in those early days they were <strong>very big</strong> in the sense that if you got your content on the Digg homepage a lot of people would see it (relative to the total size of the network at the time). And they were <strong>very accessible</strong> in the sense that it wasn‚Äôt that hard to get your content there! I recall having a bunch of Digg homepage hits and Hacker News homepage hits.</p>

<p>But - as the overall network has grown exponentially the network topology has changed. Digg, Reddit, Hacker News etc all still exist but the audience you can reach with a ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù hit there has become much smaller relative to the overall size of the network. And getting a homepage hit there is harder than ever because the volume of content has increased exponentially.</p>

<p>This causes the curious effect of people thinking it‚Äôs harder than ever to reach an audience online. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like it used to be‚Äù.</p>

<p>But! As the network grows and these large entry points to the network shrink in relative power, new entry points emerge - new ways to reach clusters of audience faster than ever before.</p>

<p>Want to reach an audience of marketers online? Hacker News used to be your best bet (despite the fact that it‚Äôs mostly engineers and startup junkies). Now you have inbound.org, growthhackers.net, Moz has a widely read newsletter, etc etc etc.</p>

<p>And many of these networks don‚Äôt rely on a common ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù format. <a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a> for example has many networks overlapping design, design criticism, product design, content, art and more. Like the digital equivalent of zines these networks are almost intentionally small and don‚Äôt have aggregated entryways. But the audience there is large enough to create meaningful connections and audience for your work if you‚Äôre willing to spend the time.</p>

<p>Every community now has a fragmented number of communities, homepages, entry points, tinyletters, influencers and networks. They overlap in weird and wonderful ways - and it means that it‚Äôs harder than ever to feel like you got a ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù success on these networks. To create a moment that has the whole audience looking at the same thing at the same time.</p>

<p>Of course, the natural consequence of these fragmented audiences is that getting some traction with one or more of these smaller entry points is easier than it ever was.</p>

<p>So, getting a post read by ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù is harder than ever but reaching hundreds or low thousands of audience has never been easier.</p>

<h2 id="the-promise-of-audience-is-big-b-blogging">The promise of audience is big B blogging</h2>

<p>So what is <strong>big B blogging</strong>? I‚Äôd contend that too much of what you read on the web is written for large audiences. Too much content on the web is designed for scale, for sharing, for gloss and finish. It‚Äôs mass media, whether it‚Äôs made by a media company or an individual acting like one. So when people think of blogging their natural reference point is create something that looks like the mass media they‚Äôre consuming. Content designed for pageviews and scale.</p>

<p>This is why it‚Äôs appealing to people writing on the web to get it in a prestigious publication, or place it somewhere with an in-built audience. i.e. Medium, Inc, Entrepreneur, Fast Company etc.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs so alluring to want to write something there because you‚Äôll get more page views than if you put it on your own site and you‚Äôll get the prestige of saying you were published in Fast Company (or, or, etc).</p>

<p>But what is lost by following big B blogging? By chasing audience we lose the ability to be ourselves. By writing for everyone we write for no one. Too often I read things otherwise smart people have written for places like Fast Company and my eyes glaze over. Personal identity is necessarily watered down. Yes those places have large audiences but they‚Äôre shallow audiences. They don‚Äôt care about <strong>you</strong> at all. Your writing washes through their feeds like water.</p>

<p>Instead - I think most people would be better served by subscribing to small b blogging. What you want is something with YOUR personality. Writing and ideas that are <strong>addressable</strong> (i.e. you can find and link to them easily in the future) and <strong>archived</strong> (i.e. you have a list of things you‚Äôve written all in one place rather than spread across publications and URLs) and <strong>memorable</strong> (i.e. has your own design, logo or style). Writing that can live and breathe in small networks. Scale be damned.</p>

<p>When you write for someone else‚Äôs publication your writing becomes disparate and UN-networked. By chasing scale and pageviews you lose identity and the ability to create meaningful, memorable connections within the network.</p>

<h2 id="go-forth-and-small-b-blog">Go forth and small b blog</h2>

<p>So I challenge you to think clearly about the many disparate networks you‚Äôre part of and think about the ideas you might want to offer those networks that you don‚Äôt want to get lost in the feed. Ideas you might want to return to. Think about how writing with and for the network might enable you to start blogging. Forget the big B blogging model. Forget Medium‚Äôs promise of page views and claps. Forget the guest post on Inc, Forbes and Entrepreneur. Forget Fast Company. Forget fast content.</p>

<p>Come join the network. Bring a blog.</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">How to generate leads for an independent consulting practice</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>The Lorenz Attractor is a chaotic system - a strange attractor. It‚Äôs an elegant and beautiful mathematical object that looks a bit like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/lorenz1.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Chaotic systems are often referenced in popular culture via the well-known butterfly effect: <em>‚ÄúDoes the flap of a butterfly‚Äôs wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>The general principle with chaotic systems is that no matter how carefully you try and control the inputs, the outputs will always surprise you.</p>

<p>This‚Ä¶ <strong>sounds a lot like the lead flow for my consulting business!</strong></p>

<p>After doing this for 4 years it‚Äôs still a surprise when and where leads come through - almost every time it‚Äôs <em>‚Äúwhy did this happen? Why now?‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>But it doesn‚Äôt mean the whole thing is random! There‚Äôs a distinction between random systems and chaotic systems. If you look at the Lorenz Attractor you can tell it‚Äôs not random - there‚Äôs a system at work - the key with chaotic systems is that you can‚Äôt control for individual outputs, but you can shape the system at large.</p>

<p>In this post I‚Äôm going to break down my personal system and philosophy for generating leads for my consulting practice - embracing the chaos of generating warm leads from real humans. It all boils down to controlling for system-level outputs not individual outcomes by focusing on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on networks over networking</li>
  <li>Articulate your work</li>
  <li>Publish to be present</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôll explain, but first:</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-primer-on-my-work">A quick primer on my work</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs worth explaining the kind of work I do, with some important caveats. I do strategic consulting work as an independent. Often I‚Äôm embedded within a client‚Äôs organization and often for long periods of time<sup id="fnref:four"><a href="#fn:four" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> (for example - think two days a week in the office for 18 months working across a variety of projects).</p>

<p>This means that - for me - I‚Äôm primarily concerned with <strong>warm leads</strong> for long term <strong>strategic work</strong>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important for <strong>leads to be warm</strong> - because it‚Äôs hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important for <strong>leads to be primed for long term strategic work</strong> - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you (this helps you get paid well and helps you have a bigger impact) and you want retained work that lasts<sup id="fnref:stewardship"><a href="#fn:stewardship" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> (this helps you smooth revenue gaps and gain some predictability).</p>

<p>This means that for me - I‚Äôm definitely optimizing for quality over quantity. 5-10 leads a year can keep me full up. And I think for many independents this will be and should be the case - optimizing for quantity will create a very different environment.</p>

<p>The varieties of styles and approaches to independent work will surprise you so I won‚Äôt claim to say this is the only way to do things but it works for me so maybe you‚Äôll learn something to add to your own approach.</p>

<h2 id="all-my-friends-are-strange-attractors">All my friends are strange attractors</h2>

<p>The Lorenz System is classified as a strange attractor - as mentioned above it‚Äôs a chaotic system - which means that no matter how closely you observe the initial conditions you will always be surprised by the output.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lorenz2.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Aside from being beautiful (and the loops looking the wings of a butterfly if you squint!) I find this visualization oddly satisfying and descriptive of two people‚Äôs lives. Their orbits entwined - strangely.</p>

<p>I imagine every relationship as some kind of Lorenz strange loop - with us at times orbiting closely and at times drifting apart. This notion of friendship with vast unknowable orbits.</p>

<p>But people - humans - contacts - friends - is where I get all of my business from. All of the leads for my consulting business come from a small number of people. In fact, running the numbers 60% of my all-time consulting revenue can be traced to just four people:</p>

<p><img src="/images/revtable.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What does this feel like in practice?</p>

<h2 id="a-butterfly-flutters">A butterfly flutters</h2>

<p>Somewhere in London in 2010(?) I met two gentlemen at a networking dinner. If I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt recall this in any way shape or form. But someone I worked with in London around the same time who is now a close friend popped into my inbox in 2016 to make a strange attraction intro‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img src="/images/lexi-intro.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This lead turned into one of the biggest single sources of consulting revenue since I‚Äôve been out on my own.</p>

<p>Another one:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ajay-intro.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This turned into a super-useful project for me that snowballed into the last year working in media. Funny how those things go.</p>

<p>Sometimes though it‚Äôs people you don‚Äôt know very well. This is someone who I interviewed for a senior role at a previous job - who then turned the tables and put me forward for a consulting gig:</p>

<p><img src="/images/li-intro.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ok - so‚Ä¶ Humans power this whole warm-leads business.</p>

<p>But of all the humans I know - why these ones? Is it random? How can we motivate people to send us work? There‚Äôs two things you can do - build a network and talk to them.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-build-a-network-of-strange-attractors">Ways to build a network of strange attractors</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs obvious - but often overlooked - that to build a flow of warm referrals you need to have a network of folks who know you, and know what projects you‚Äôre a good fit for. So how do you build a larger network? Some approaches:</p>

<h3 id="public-groups">Public Groups</h3>

<p>My friend <a href="http://carlyayres.com">Carly Ayres</a> (who just sunsetted her studio - RIP Hawraf) hosts a meetup series called <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90161136/inside-the-invite-only-slack-channel-for-designers">100s under 100</a>. It‚Äôs a friends of friends kind of thing but open to a large group (these meetups range from a small group to 100s).</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.markpollard.net/">Mark Pollard</a> runs <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sweathead/">Sweathead</a> a public FB group for strategists. He‚Äôs a community-building natural and he actively cultivates community, engagement and audience - for example he has a <a href="https://www.markpollard.net/sweathead-podcast/">Sweathead podcast</a> that interviews many people from the community itself.</p>

<p>These events are a great platform to build awareness and large groups of loose networks as well as gain authority by being the public figure-head of a large group.</p>

<h3 id="private-groups">Private Groups</h3>

<p>I know a variety of private invite-only groups - most of these happen on Slack these days. One in particular that is especially high signal-to-noise is the <a href="http://www.sundaydinner.com/slack/">Sunday Dinners slack group</a>. This group is small, has less virtue signaling - since it‚Äôs private - but can be a wonderful way to build a more intimate group of close ties. These private groups are typically &lt;150 members. Anything above that and I think you start to lose the intimate nature and it turns into something more akin to a public group.</p>

<p>One advantage of these private groups is the ability to discuss work-in-progress and the more raw side of client / project challenges and success. This can help bridge a true picture of what work looks like for you which sets you up for success when cultivating warm intros.</p>

<h3 id="small-gatherings">Small Gatherings</h3>
<p>Over the past two years I‚Äôve been hosting invite-only dinner events. They usually run 10-15 people and, honestly, are a weird mix of my actual friends, people I know doing interesting things and people who I know will get value from the weird mix I put together. There‚Äôs no structure to these events but they form bonds and connections between many different people in my networks.</p>

<p>Across all three of these approaches - <strong>the key is to be the anchor of the network</strong>. By being the anchor you gain an order of magnitude more recognition and exposure than merely attending someone else‚Äôs event or being a member in someone else‚Äôs slack. Being the anchor of a group of 10 is better than being a member of a group of 100 (though of course they‚Äôre not mutually exclusive!).</p>

<h2 id="strange-communication---aka-talking-to-your-network">Strange communication - aka talking to your network</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs not enough to just have a network though. You need to talk to them for two key reasons:</p>

<p>Firstly - <strong>the key to getting good leads is helping your network understand what opportunities you might be a good fit for</strong>. You have to help your network understand what you do and how you think. This is so much more than just ‚Äúmarketing work‚Äù - you need to really get granular. If you look back at the human warm leads above they all had a specific point of entry - for example ‚ÄúSEO leader with a background in content and commerce‚Äù. You need to talk and share with your network so that they can find these specific reference points for a warm intro.</p>

<p>Secondly - <strong>being top of mind is, remarkably, an effective tactic</strong>. Humans are wired for recency so if someone saw a post or email of yours recently they‚Äôll be much more likely to put you forward for work. Especially the further out you go in the fringes of your network you need to be seen to be remembered.</p>

<p>If you look at the above examples - 100 under 100, Sweathead, Sunday Dinners, my own dinner series - every single one is a great platform that is taken advantage of by the owners to educate and talk about the work they do beyond just sharing client names. This creates a great surface area to cultivate the right kinds of work from your network.</p>

<p>So, listen, I‚Äôm gonna sound like a broken record, but the blog+newsletter combo is a great answer. For independents you have to carve out your own little space to write and distribute your ideas. And don‚Äôt worry about chasing scale. From my piece <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">small b blogging</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>small b blogging. It‚Äôs a virtuous cycle of making interesting connections while also being a way to clarify and strengthen my own ideas. I‚Äôm not reaching a big audience by any measure but the direct impact and benefit is material.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Small b blogging is learning to write and think with the network. Small b blogging is writing content designed for small deliberate audiences and showing it to them. Small b blogging is deliberately chasing interesting ideas over pageviews and scale. An attempt at genuine connection vs the gloss and polish and mass market of most ‚Äúcontent marketing‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-butterflies-and-sea-gulls">On butterflies and sea-gulls</h2>

<p>Remember that chaos-theory-butterfly anecdote?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúDoes the flap of a butterfly‚Äôs wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, it was originally a quote about sea-gulls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúOne meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a sea gull‚Äôs wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/seagull.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The poor ugly un-poetic seagull<sup id="fnref:tokyo"><a href="#fn:tokyo" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the story here? The lesson is that language is a virus. Design your case studies to be pithy - talk about your work in small fragments that can be repeated in oral culture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúCommerce and content‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúHired a team of 10‚Äù</li>
  <li>‚ÄúInterim CMO‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>These short phrases can sum up and signal so much to the right person at the right time - and you can use many of them at once. This is an ongoing project of listening to how people make intros for you - and noting the little phrases they use. How are people understanding and describing your work in the two-line email?</p>

<h2 id="reducing-ambiguity-using-a-capabilities-deck">Reducing ambiguity using a capabilities deck</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs a problem with warm leads though - you get caught up in email FW: FW: intros and nebulous-sounding intros and requests. This is a two-sided problem - it‚Äôs hard for you to know which ones are worth your time, and it‚Äôs hard for the other party to know if you‚Äôre a good fit for their needs.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found that having a ‚Äúcapabilities deck‚Äù - i.e. a PDF that summarizes the work you do and who do it for - is useful and helpful in closing the right kinds of work.</p>

<p>For example - see this email exchange:</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-deck.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this example - a warm intro has become a luke-warm intro. I‚Äôve never met or talked to person A who‚Äôs intro-ing me to person B. This is often the kind of thing that goes no-where. So I throw out a <em>‚Äúpleasure to meet you, here‚Äôs a PDF, let me know if there‚Äôs a fit?‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>That email turned into a big project, and it was the second time I‚Äôd ever used a PDF attachment to explain my work.</p>

<p>The very first time I used a capabilities deck attachment? This one:</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-deck-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This email - in March - closed 6 months later. I attached my capabilities deck as a ‚Äúhey, also‚Äù but it worked.</p>

<p>When you first start out as a consultant - I‚Äôm not entirely sure a capabilities deck is the right thing to spend time and energy on. You‚Äôll likely not have enough stuff to put in it and you‚Äôll spin your wheels with the language you use. But once you have completed a few projects and are starting to generate enough of these warm leads I think it can be a useful tool to have.</p>

<p>Looking for an example? Check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15dK-oRMr6KFy4YiWH51NPhPrld3v906AndndQgc5QVw/edit">Mark Pollard‚Äôs</a> for a good public example.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs much more to be written about how to put one of these together<sup id="fnref:capdeck"><a href="#fn:capdeck" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> but for now I think aim to be concise and precise. Aim for 10 slides. Be specific about what you do.</p>

<h2 id="the-weird-many-colored-butterfly">The weird many-colored butterfly</h2>

<p>I want to take a moment to talk about ‚Äúweird work‚Äù. Many independents feel trapped in a box - unable to ‚Äúbreak out‚Äù into work that they either want to do or feel interested in. I <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/01/22/weird-work/">asked Venkatesh Rao</a> how to find more alternative work out of your comfort zone and he said this (bolding mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think you just have to do whatever most energizes you and produces a lot of output, and let the work/opportunities find you. I have never gotten an enjoyable weird gig out of going fishing myself. You choose boring, normal work, but interesting, weird work chooses you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quantity has a quality all its own as Lenin said. The sheer volume of your work is what works as a signal of weirdness, because anyone can be do a one-off weird thing, but <strong>only volume can signal a consistently weird production sensibility that will inspire people betting on you. The energy evident in a body of work is the most honest signal about it that makes people trust you to do things for them</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote is very true for weird work - but applies to any kind of new direction you want to take. Only volume can signal a specific sensibility that makes people trust you to do things for them.</p>

<p>So if you want more work in a specific vein - write about it! Talk about it! Consistent output will get you there - though of course the flip side of this is that you have to recognize that it can take time to build up this output so likely won‚Äôt happen quickly.</p>

<h2 id="podcasts--conferences---oral-traditions-of-storytelling">Podcasts &amp; conferences - oral traditions of storytelling</h2>

<p>Because we‚Äôre focusing on generating warm leads from real humans - it‚Äôs not just about what you say but also how you say it. The oral tradition is important. Conferences and podcasts are two accessible platforms for telling human - oral - stories.</p>

<p>As an independent it can be hard to break into the conference and podcast circuit. Typically you are lacking the recognized labels and power that comes with a full time job to be considered by organizers and hosts.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a whole blog post brewing in me about the specific challenges of getting invited to speak as an independent - the crux of it I think boils down to making ‚Äúthings with labels‚Äù. Books, art projects, websites, communities, etc are all great ways to build some semblance of ‚Äútrust totems‚Äù that an organizer or host can recognize and use to invite you into the spotlight.</p>

<p>Nothing allows you to forge human connections at scale quite like the spoken word. So you should leap at these opportunities - tell you story and talk about the work (at least a little).</p>

<h2 id="on-catching-butterflies">On catching butterflies</h2>

<p><img src="/images/nabakov-butterfly.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Catching butterflies is a fine hobby<sup id="fnref:nabakov"><a href="#fn:nabakov" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. A relaxing past-time. But the idea of dissecting, analyzing and cataloging butterflies tells you nothing of the storms in Tokyo that these little wings once caused.</p>

<p>Trying to build a CRM and lead-management tool for a solo independent business that lives on 5-10 leads a year feels a lot like catching butterflies. If you‚Äôre looking for a hobby and like spending hours alone with dead insects then‚Ä¶ fine? But otherwise - I‚Äôd encourage you to focus your time and energies on building networks over tracking each lead minutely.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2>

<p>Remember - all of this is my perspective, and there‚Äôs as many different ways of running a consulting business as there are varieties of butterflies. The key points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Warm leads power well-paid strategic work</li>
  <li>Cultivating warm leads requires working with, and understanding humans</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs hard to predict individual outcomes but in aggregate we can control the system in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Anchor our own networks</li>
      <li>Communicate regularly and explain the work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Listen to how people make intros for key ways to describe the work</li>
  <li>If you find yourself overwhelmed with ambiguous lukewarm leads consider a capabilities deck</li>
  <li>Embrace the oral platforms (conferences, podcasts) to create connections</li>
  <li>Finally, don‚Äôt belabor any kind of CRM unless you enjoy butterfly-collecting as a hobby</li>
</ul>

<p>What‚Äôs your experience building networks and leads for your consulting business?</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">How to find the ‚Äúdark leads‚Äù hiding in your network to generate client work</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>The biggest challenge independent consultants face is generating new clients. When you sit down and analyze your lead flow it‚Äôs hard to draw meaningful conclusions - there aren‚Äôt that many leads to begin with so you‚Äôve got a small sample size - and many leads appear to land in your lap ‚Äúout of thin air‚Äù with no obvious way to trace back the source‚Ä¶</p>

<p>So how do you generate more leads? In particular - how do you find good leads that are warm and primed for strategic work. In my previous post, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/">Strange Attraction</a>, I talked about the power of your network and why warm leads for strategic work is important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs important for <strong>leads to be warm</strong> - because it‚Äôs hard to convince someone to spend $20k / month on a consulting contract without them already thinking they might spend money on consulting (and having some kind of budget earmarked!)</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs important for <strong>leads to be primed for long term strategic work</strong> - because you want large enough problems that the senior leadership of the business is talking to you (this helps you get paid well and helps you have a bigger impact) and you want retained work that lasts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Building a resilient and strong network around you is obviously important but in this post I‚Äôm going to argue that weak ties are often at work behind the scenes - and that weak ties are where opportunity scales beyond your immediate close network.</p>

<p>This works because of two key ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Weak ties are more likely to be a bridge between disparate networks and so scale your reach beyond your strong ties</li>
  <li>Weak ties can still make strong intros - not because they care about you but because they gain social capital by making a strong intro.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post we‚Äôll take a look at some network theory and a classic paper ‚Äúthe strength of weak ties‚Äù to examine these ideas and then explore ways to cultivate weak ties in your network.</p>

<h2 id="the-cozy-web--dark-leads">The Cozy Web &amp; Dark Leads</h2>

<p>Who recognizes this kind of request - posted in a private Slack group?</p>

<p><img src="/images/dark-lead.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this image I‚Äôm playing the role of client - fielding a client lead out into a Slack group.</p>

<p>A ton of leads flow through these ‚Äúdark‚Äù or ‚Äúcozy‚Äù<sup id="fnref:cozy"><a href="#fn:cozy" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> online spaces - Slack groups, discord groups, telegram groups, whatsapp chains, email lists and more. When a client is looking to hire a consultant or agency they first turn to their network, often in a closed space (vs an open space like LinkedIn or Twitter).</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs call these asks for referrals ‚Äúdark leads.‚Äù</p>

<p>As an indie consultant - these ‚Äúdark leads‚Äù are fascinating. It‚Äôs a hugely valuable source of leads, but by definition they‚Äôre hard to visualize, hard to grasp. Like dark matter, we can feel the gravitational pull of these dark leads but can‚Äôt see them.</p>

<p>The key to unlocking these dark leads is through understanding our weak ties.</p>

<h2 id="the-strength-of-weak-ties">The Strength of Weak Ties</h2>

<p>To understand the flow of information and connections I went back to the original 1973 paper <a href="https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj9501/f/publications/the_strength_of_weak_ties_and_exch_w-gans.pdf">the strength of weak ties</a> from Mark Granovetter. It‚Äôs a foundational paper and reading I was really struck by the core concepts. In essence - your weak ties are deeply valuable. Take this example from the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a random sample of recent professional, technical, and managerial job changers living in a Boston suburb <strong>16.7% reported that they saw their contact often at the time, 55.6% said occasionally, and 27.8% rarely! The skew is clearly to the weak end of the continuum, suggesting the primacy of structure over motivation</strong>.</p>

  <p>In many cases, the contact was someone only marginally included in the current network of contacts, such as an old college friend or a former workmate or employer, with whom sporadic contact had been maintained [‚Ä¶]</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that people receive crucial information from individuals whose very existence they have forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>‚ÄúSuggesting the primacy of structure over motivation‚Äù</strong> - let‚Äôs pause on that. What this is saying is that the shape of your network, the structure of the ties, is more important than the motivation of your strong ties. Said another way, while your strong ties are motivated to help you and actively working on your side they also generally know the same people you do, while it‚Äôs your weak ties that are likely to be able to connect you to opportunities outside your core network.</p>

<p>This concept of weak ties being powerful is actually not immediately intuitive - the original paper has some light maths but I‚Äôd encourage you to read it to get a feel for why this is true. One of the core reasons is because weak ties are more likely to be ‚Äúbridging ties‚Äù - i.e. those that connect you from one group to another group. You can read the whole paper for more detail but in summary ‚Äúexcept under unlikely conditions, no strong tie is a bridge‚Äù - or said another way, all of your bridges to other groups are weak ties.</p>

<p>Look at the following image (from the paper) - where solid lines are strong ties, and dotted lines are weak ties:</p>

<p><img src="/images/weak-ties-diagram-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can clearly see that there is no possible connection between D and B except via a weak tie.</p>

<p>A more modern version of this chart might look something like this - where the only way to traverse these dark/cozy networks is via weak ties (note how the only lines between groups are dotted lines):</p>

<p><img src="/images/weak-ties-diagram-2.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs return to that Slack request where I‚Äôm playing client - on the hunt for a UX designer for a client project:</p>

<p><img src="/images/elan-lead.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In my search, I posted in two Slack groups I‚Äôm part of and pinged two close friends I thought might have good referrals. The above chat with Elan was the one that struck gold - the next day I had an intro to a UX designer (thanks Elan!) who successfully partnered on the project with me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dark-lead-diagram.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But, from the perspective of the UX designer, it would seem like this client project fell in his lap ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù - a ‚Äúdark lead‚Äù that he had no visibility into.</p>

<p>Ok, so we know these dark leads operate via weak ties - but it‚Äôs still seemingly random. Is there a way to be more intentional? Is there a way to optimize our presence in the network to capture these dark leads? Let‚Äôs explore.</p>

<h2 id="dark-leads-have-limited-reach-but-are-rich-in-social-capital">Dark Leads have limited reach but are rich in social capital</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at the anatomy of a typical ‚Äúdark lead.‚Äù In the example above it was a 1:1 DM that gained me the intro but in many cases these requests are put into group spaces:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dark-lead-anatomy.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This request is in a #referrals slack channel in a group I‚Äôm part of with 121 members. There‚Äôs two interesting characteristics of dark leads:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Of the 120 people in the channel, it‚Äôs very rare for someone to re-share it into their own networks. <strong>Unless I have a strong tie with Jenna I‚Äôm highly unlikely to risk my social capital and invest time and energy in re-sharing the request</strong>. So these dark leads typically have a very low r0 (in 2020‚Äôs parlance!). They have a short half-life and don‚Äôt get re-shared. Their reach is limited to the immediate audience they‚Äôre shared to.</li>
  <li><strong>People are motivated to make intros because they gain social capital by doing so</strong>. Making a good intro to Jenna raises my social capital both with Jenna and with the group.</li>
</ol>

<p>The idea that these dark leads are rich in social capital - but have limited reach - is why weak ties are so valuable. For this dark lead to reach you, you need a weak tie to be present and able to make an intro - in other words <strong>you need to be able to source leads from people you don‚Äôt know in places you‚Äôre not in</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="weak-ties--strong-intros">Weak Ties &amp; Strong Intros</h2>

<p>So what does this mean for indie consultants? There are two key insights here:</p>

<p>Firstly, <strong>you need a network that has reach - not just close ties</strong> but rather enough weak ties and adjacent people who you‚Äôre connected with that one of those 100 people in the Slack channel can make an intro for you. And they don‚Äôt need to like you, because:</p>

<p>Secondly, <strong>people gain social capital from making good intros</strong>. People only gain social capital from making an intro that‚Äôs a good fit, and you only gain clients when you get a good client/consultant fit. So you need to educate and explain your work in a way that even weak ties have a good enough understanding of the kind of leads you‚Äôd be a good fit for.</p>

<p>So what we‚Äôre looking for is a large surface area of weak ties - people capable of making a good intro. Remember that weak ties don‚Äôt need to like you, they just need to understand your work well enough to be able to make a strong intro (because it accrues them social capital).</p>

<h2 id="cultivating-weak-ties---why-the-1000-true-fans-model-is-unhelpful">Cultivating Weak Ties - Why the ‚Äú1000 true fans‚Äù model is unhelpful</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs obvious that a strong network and audience helps you gain clients - but often when people think about building an audience and expanding their network, they think of something like the ‚Äú1000 true fans‚Äù model from Kevin Kelly. They believe that building a network of fans - people who are really rooting for you and pay attention to you - will drive clients and strong intros.</p>

<p>I see many independent folks building intimate, deep connections with their audience. <a href="https://tinyletter.com/tomcritchlow">Tinyletter spaces</a> often feel like this - places to foster deep connections with your audience. And certainly building 1000 true fans and deep connections is powerful and useful! But it‚Äôs not the whole picture - in my experience many indie consultants over-index on the smaller stronger network at the expense of cultivating a broader weaker network.</p>

<p>The key is to look for balance - to build the kind of online presence that can support BOTH intimate relationships AND a broader surface area to cultivate weak ties.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: I cultivate my network in a variety of ways broad and deep. My Tinyletter is a more intimate space while my Twitter profile spans a variety of topics and groups. My discord group is a more intimate, smaller group while my blog reaches all kinds of folks.</p>

  <p><img src="/images/spaces-2x2-new.svg" alt="" /></p>

  <p>For more on this idea see <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/08/discord/">my post on setting up a discord server for my blog</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The trend du jour is Substack - and it‚Äôs a great model. But I‚Äôd argue that many Substacks are about building deeper relationships with a subscriber base - where the goal is to engage a portion of your audience in every email.</p>

<p>The difference between Substack and blogging might seem academic but it highlights a key point.</p>

<p>Substack is a great way to build an audience and it can be a great way to build 1000 true fans. But the model is optimized for reaching the same audience consistently - not for building new audiences.</p>

<p>Blogging, conversely, isn‚Äôt designed for building an audience in quite the same way - but is a better tool for reaching new and different audiences each time you publish. When blogging, you can feel more free to roam across subjects, themes and ideas while Substack‚Äôs form suggests a tighter and more consistent frame.</p>

<p>Neither is right - but the blogging model can be useful for cultivating weak ties. Blogging reaches a slightly different audience each time and that‚Äôs a feature not a bug!</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-weak-ties-have-a-good-mental-model-of-your-work">Ensuring Weak Ties Have a Good Mental Model of your Work</h2>

<p>Building weak ties however is only one part of the equation - we also need those weak ties to have a good enough mental model of your work that they can make a good intro. Remember - people only accrue social capital from making an intro if it‚Äôs a good match, and that requires them to remember you at the right time.</p>

<p>Take this example, no offense to the tweeter here, I really love people trying to make intros for me! But this is not a great fit for my current work:</p>

<p><img src="/images/twitter-intro.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead, this intro is a note from someone I barely know in a slack group:</p>

<p><img src="/images/warm-intro.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note how the intro is primed around the kind of work that I‚Äôve done in the past (audience growth strategy) and they have a reference point from a previous client project. This eventually turned into a client project that was a good fit for my skills.</p>

<p>This is the key to ensuring weak ties can make strong intros - ensuring that they have a memetic image of your work in their mind so that they can correctly connect you to the right kind of leads.</p>

<p>I use the word <em>memetic</em> here to suggest not only that people need to know clearly what kind of work you do but also that your brand, your image and your work needs to be <em>memorable</em> and designed to be re-shared in response to one of these dark leads.</p>

<p>So how do you provide a strong mental model of your work to your weak ties? There are three key ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You need to provide real examples of the work, not just the output</li>
  <li>You need to project the right level of seniority</li>
  <li>You need to be visible, sustainably</li>
</ol>

<p>Let‚Äôs break those down:</p>

<h3 id="1-show-the-process-not-just-the-output">1. Show the process, not just the output</h3>

<p>A great way to provide a look at your work is to peel back the curtain on your process. To demonstrate what the actual working relationship looks like - not just the output<sup id="fnref:vibe"><a href="#fn:vibe" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a big fan of <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/">thinking in public</a>, it‚Äôs a great way to give your network a feel for the actual work, and why I think typically this kind of publishing is more valuable for indie consultants than case studies. Case studies are difficult to produce, limited in scope and tend to overly focus on the results, while thinking in public is an approach that emphasizes sharing as you go, sharing half-finished work and ideas and allows you to roam across disciplines, industries and themes.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: my writing about consulting (meta alert!) showcases a bunch of real examples of my work. From recent posts: <em>‚Äúworking inside an organization attempting a large re-org each VP presented their own budgets and headcount plan to the c-suite‚Äù</em> and <em>‚ÄúI was working with the market leader in a category who was getting complacent with growth‚Äù</em> and <em>‚Äúworking with a media company to overhaul their strategy‚Äù</em></p>

<h3 id="2-project-the-right-seniority">2. Project the right seniority</h3>

<p>A key ingredient for getting client/consultant fit is finding the right seniority. These days I‚Äôm rarely working with anyone below VP-level, and typically working directly with the C-suite. It‚Äôs important to project the right signals here to ensure you don‚Äôt have a mis-aligned intro even for a project that you might otherwise be a good fit for.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: My post about <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">navigating power and status</a> is all about engaging with the VP/C-suite of client organizations. This kind of signaling correctly anchors my audience at the right level of engagement. Testimonials can do this well too - see <a href="https://andyraskin.com/">Andy Raskin‚Äôs site</a> that lists a whole bunch of founder/C-suite quotes.</p>
</div>

<p>Projecting seniority is typically about as straight forward as name-dropping job titles‚Ä¶ But there is a sensibility you can project of having a contextual view of a client‚Äôs business - see my post <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/">the strategic independent</a> for more on the concentric circle of context idea.</p>

<h3 id="3-find-a-way-to-sustain-visibility">3. Find a way to sustain visibility</h3>

<p>While all this theorizing is cute, one of the aspects most correlated with generating leads is simply being visible. Tweeting, posting, commenting, blogging, emailing. It doesn‚Äôt matter the medium, humans are hardwired for recency and if you‚Äôve been visible recently you‚Äôre more likely to get a referral, especially from your weak ties.</p>

<p>This is why building a network can be exhausting - there‚Äôs a constant pressure to publish, to promote, to ping. So it‚Äôs important to think about ways to build a sustainable way to be visible<sup id="fnref:feedback"><a href="#fn:feedback" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For some nuanced advice on this topic - I love Willa Koerner‚Äôs advice in ‚Äú<a href="https://willakoerner.com/project/digital-gardening">strategic digital gardening</a>‚Äù about creating a digital presence that not only works for your audience but that works for you too. For anyone who feels like networking or blogging makes them want to vomit then this might be for you.</p>

<p><img src="/images/willa-gardening.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ultimately to find a sustainable way to be visible you‚Äôll need to find your own medium, voice and style that works for you. This can take time to develop so seek some ways to get started in low-risk ways and look to create things that you <em>want</em> to create, not things that you think some abstract audience wants. And it doesn‚Äôt need to be writing - if you‚Äôre a visual thinker share a figma file or a deck, if you‚Äôre improvisational try a vlog or a podcast, if you‚Äôre a poet try poetry! You‚Äôll have a lot more success by being sustainably visible in a medium where you feel comfortable than trying to force yourself to create content because you think you should in a way that makes you cringe.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When you first start out as an independent you won‚Äôt have a clear vision of the work you do and you‚Äôll inevitably lean hard on your strong ties to generate clients. That‚Äôs fine! It‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work. But to succeed in building a sustainable practice you‚Äôll need to learn how to cultivate a large surface area of weak ties and create a clear, memorable image of the work you do so that your weak ties can make strong intros.</p>

<p>Of course, in practice work will flow through both strong ties and weak ties - I‚Äôm 6 years in and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/26/unbundling-nyc-calendly/">run roughly 50/50</a> for revenue generated through strong ties and weak ties.</p>

<p>But perhaps by understanding the power of weak ties we can demystify the ‚Äúrandom acts of client work‚Äù that come to us and learn how to be more deliberate in building networks that generate client work.</p>

        <h1 class="posttitle" id="section2chapter4">Rejecting Specialization</h1>
        <h2 class="postsubtitle">Using vibes and voice to find the right consulting clients</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>There are two types of indie consultants. There are those that have created a very clear specialization, you can look at their website and see something like <em>‚ÄúI help B2B SaaS companies with their content strategy‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúI help brands build audience via email‚Äù</em>. The indie consultants that do this well seem very busy, well known and respected in their industry. It‚Äôs fairly easy to see from the outside what their work looks.</p>

<p>Then there are those who are‚Ä¶ weirder, less legible, harder to define. Folks who‚Äôs website doesn‚Äôt have a tight <em>‚ÄúI do X for Y‚Äù</em>. These people likely project a weird sensibility via their online writing and persona, building a body of work that points to a kind of vibe.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easier to see from the outside when the first group is successful, and it‚Äôs fairly easy to imagine what the work looks like. The second group is much less legible. Are they successful? What kind of work do they even do?</p>

<p>There are plenty of success stories for the first group - lots of books, articles, podcasts and case studies. If you read around you might think that you should follow in their footsteps, that this path is both more successful and easier.</p>

<p>But I don‚Äôt buy it. I‚Äôve been an indie consultant for 8 years and have built a network and community of fellow indies. I‚Äôve had many open and honest private conversations with indies about money, success and anxiety. Through these conversations I‚Äôve come to two realizations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For many indie consultants who have rejected the 9-5 of full-time employment, trying to specialize and box yourself in is a path to burnout and failure</li>
  <li>This second group of weird indie consultants is often just as successful as the first group (if not more so) - they‚Äôre just less vocal about it</li>
</ol>

<p>So in this post I‚Äôm going to reject the commonly accepted wisdom and look at why specializing is hard, why it fails and what an alternative path looks like. The answer lies in developing strong opinions and a distinctive vibe.</p>

<h2 id="specializing-is-not-even-wrong">Specializing is ‚Äúnot even wrong‚Äù</h2>

<p>If you look around at common advice for indie consultants you‚Äôll get told to specialize: to create a narrow definition of who you‚Äôre serving and what you offer.</p>

<p>You might think something like: <em>‚ÄúIf only I could clearly articulate WHO my ideal clients are and WHAT they want, then I could figure out how to drive leads‚Äù</em>. There‚Äôs plenty of conventional wisdom that supports this idea. As Philip Morgan says in his book <a href="https://philipmorganconsulting.com/positioning-manual/">The Positioning Manual for Indie Consultants</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To get ahead with your consulting business, you need to create visibility in the market and earn enough trust to make selling easier. These two things, visibility and trust, are much easier to get if you SPECIALIZE in something, in some way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Philip is right about trust and visibility being important. Trust is important because we want senior clients primed for strategy work. Visibility is important because we need clients to know us and find us.</p>

<p>But specializing? Philip isn‚Äôt exactly wrong about specializing - in theory specializing is the most viable way to create a steady stream of clients. But, in practice, I often see this path being the <strong>wrong option</strong>. The problem is that good specialization is exceptionally hard. And mediocre specialization has two core problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It attracts less senior, more tightly defined work that traps you in a mode of repeatable execution work</li>
  <li>It puts you in a well defined box that grinds against your identity</li>
</ol>

<p>We think that the primary function of positioning is for the market - for clients to better discover and hire you. But I‚Äôd argue that positioning is primarily for your own ego. It‚Äôs an inner game of figuring out who you feel comfortable being, more than a driver of clients.</p>

<p>Specifically, many independent consultants are generalists - trying to find interesting,  senior work. They crave an escape from the narrow confines of 9-5, and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to reconcile a narrow specialization with your quest to be a senior generalist. This is a classic failure mode that I see time and time again: generalist indie consultants trying to fit themselves into a narrow positioning just to try and manufacture clients and in the process causing themselves stress, anxiety and ultimately burn out.</p>

<p>This anxiety is real. Feeling the peer pressure and established wisdom pushing you down a path to specialize - despite the fact that it grinds against your identity. You feel like you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do it. But I‚Äôd argue that <strong><em>for most indie consultants</em></strong>, you‚Äôd be better off leaning into your uniqueness and point of view as a way to generate senior clients consistently.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-specializing-hard">Why is Specializing Hard?</h2>

<p>The problem with the advice to specialize is that it‚Äôs not even wrong! The advice is correct - IF you can create a narrow positioning, if you can become a visible, trusted expert in a particular niche then you will attract clients. It will solve your problems.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs a big IF‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The advice is not even wrong because most independent consultants <strong><em>can‚Äôt</em></strong> create a narrow positioning. The problem is that we think choosing a specialization and positioning is based on looking at the intersection of work we‚Äôre good at and what the market wants.</p>

<p><img src="/images/product-market-venn.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is hard enough to do - especially in the early days of consulting when you don‚Äôt have enough work yet to really understand what you‚Äôre good at or what the market wants. But once you start to figure out some kind of product/market fit for your consulting you start to uncover a third, hidden agenda:</p>

<p><img src="/images/product-market-true-venn.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This third agenda is why specializing can lead to burnout. We‚Äôre not just looking for product/market fit for our consulting work - but our consulting work is deeply tied to our identity and we need a way to make it sustainable. This third hidden question is why specializing is so hard and even impossible for many independent consultants. Even if you can choose a specialization that meets the top two circles - something that you are good at that the market wants - can you reconcile that with your sense of identity? Can you craft an identity that you feel comfortable with, that gives you energy? Are you comfortable with who you might become?</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: The obvious and ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù positioning for my own consulting work should have been some variation of SEO consulting. My history in the SEO industry meant that I had visibility and trust. I‚Äôd spoken at conferences all around the world, I‚Äôd worked with big brands.</p>

  <p>But I also saw the SEO industry as a dead end for me personally. Not that SEO is doomed or irrelevant but it wasn‚Äôt the path I wanted to follow to ensure I was challenging myself, broadening my horizons and working on new creative challenges.</p>

  <p>This led to a lot of internal angst. Should I follow the standard path and do the work that I‚Äôm well known for and can comfortably deliver? Ultimately I decided to iterate my way out of SEO - to take the familiar SEO work to pay the bills in the early days but to aggressively pursue bigger, more strategic and more creative kinds of work. It took me 1-2 years to feel like I‚Äôd really ‚Äúescaped SEO‚Äù and was on a new path to new kinds of work.</p>

  <p>This kind of internal angst is very common - there‚Äôs a clear path to follow but it‚Äôs known and well understood. And you didn‚Äôt set out as an independent to follow paths you‚Äôve already walked‚Ä¶</p>
</div>

<p>The biggest fear of independent consultants when specializing is not just that it will narrow your options - but that will take you down a path you already know.</p>

<p>Many independent consultants are independent for a reason - we‚Äôre contrarian, we‚Äôre attracted to a myriad, varied array of work. We chase novelty and surprise - we‚Äôre often seeking an alternative path. And specialization doesn‚Äôt lend itself well to novelty and surprise.</p>

<p>Instead, especially in the early days of consulting, you‚Äôre chasing the greatest possible surface area of distinct clients in an attempt to better understand the interplay of what you‚Äôre good at, what people will pay for and who you want to be.</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs not just paying clients you‚Äôre chasing - you‚Äôre chasing senior clients paying good money for interesting work.</p>

<h2 id="the-hidden-price-ceiling-of-specializing">The Hidden Price Ceiling of Specializing</h2>

<p>Good specializing is hard, because if you don‚Äôt do it well, you can end up trapping yourself. By creating a narrow positioning or specialization you make yourself more legible and understandable - you‚Äôre essentially optimizing for well-defined work. And well-defined work is less senior, less well paid and less interesting.</p>

<p>You can separate most work into two buckets: well-defined and ambiguous.</p>

<p><strong>Well defined work</strong> is the kind of recognizable work where the client has clarity around both the problem and solution. This is the kind of standardized work that you see agencies pitch - things like ‚Äúcontent strategy‚Äù, ‚Äúuser research‚Äù, ‚ÄúSEO audit‚Äù or ‚Äúwebsite design‚Äù. Well defined work has clear naming and down this path you see work that has an RFP and multiple competing vendors. Well define work is won by tight positioning.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tight-positioning-triangles.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Ambiguous work</strong> on the other hand is where either the problem or solution are not fully formed. Perhaps the client has a goal like <em>‚Äúhow do I expand my business into a new country?‚Äù</em> but an unclear solution. Or perhaps they have a problem <em>‚Äúgrowth has stalled for our agency‚Äù</em> and lack clarity about both what is causing the problem AND what a solution would look like. Here the client doesn‚Äôt even know the shape of the work - so they need to rely on a kind of vibe to select the right consultant.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ambiguous-positioning-blob.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This distinction between well-defined and ambiguous work has a lot of implications‚Ä¶</p>

<p>In short, not only is ambiguous work more fun and interesting - but crucially, it‚Äôs more senior. If you want to push into more senior work with long term well paid retainers, then you need to push into ambiguous work.</p>

<h3 id="all-senior-work-is-ambiguous">All Senior Work is Ambiguous</h3>

<p>A VP of product or a CMO doesn‚Äôt get that role just because they are an expert in product management or an expert in marketing. They get that role because in addition to some product or marketing expertise they also have a blend of senior skills - across communication, leadership, management, vision and the ability to get things done.</p>

<p>As you get more senior, the focus and emphasis on narrow domain skills gets replaced with a more ambiguous blend of skills and expertise, a kind of executive presence.</p>

<p>The problem with a carefully crafted positioning is that it typically makes the wrong part efficient - it makes it easier for clients to hire you for well defined work. It allows greater legibility, trust and expertise around <strong>work which is well defined</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a trap that I see many indie consultants back themselves into - through creating a narrow positioning they end up optimizing for lower quality client work. They increase their dealflow for clients, but only for smaller, less valuable and less senior clients. This results in ending up delivering a lot of routine work. It can fill your pipeline but leave your soul empty.</p>

<p>Instead, what senior clients want from a consulting engagement is not just skills or expertise, it‚Äôs experience and momentum. They need to move their org in a direction that it‚Äôs currently resisting - and so they look to outside help to kickstart a new direction and provide fresh energy and momentum to get something new off the ground. (This is <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">capacity building consulting</a> like I‚Äôve talked about before).</p>

<h3 id="great-positioning-if-you-can-pull-it-off-can-lead-to-ambiguous-work">Great positioning, if you can pull it off, can lead to ambiguous work</h3>

<p>Let‚Äôs acknowledge that great positioning and specialization <em>can</em> lead to ambiguous work. It‚Äôs very rare to see this kind of specialization - it‚Äôs very much the exception, not the rule. But let‚Äôs take a look at an example.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: <a href="https://andyraskin.com/">Andy Raskin</a> is a consultant specializing in ‚Äústrategic narrative‚Äù. His website says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>CEO ENGAGEMENTS: ALIGN YOUR LEADERSHIP TEAM AROUND A STRATEGIC NARRATIVE</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <p>In these engagements, I help venture-backed CEOs and their leadership teams align around a high-level story that powers success‚Äîin sales, marketing, fundraising, product development and recruiting‚Äîby getting everyone on the same page about strategy and differentiation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is a rare breed of specializing - that allows you to both define a senior audience and define the work, while still leaving room to drive a bus through in terms of how this work is actually delivered. Note that Andy‚Äôs use of ‚Äústrategic narrative‚Äù is essentially defining a proprietary approach and type of work.</p>

  <p>You easily imagine how this specialization allows for senior, ambiguous work that leads to ongoing retainers - I can imagine how this strategic narrative impacts every part of the organization so it could easily lead to all kinds of work. But - you have to ask yourself carefully if you‚Äôre able to create this kind of senior and ambiguous specialization‚Ä¶ Most can‚Äôt.</p>

  <p>(And as we‚Äôll see later much of Andy‚Äôs success is due to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andyraskin_i-peg-2015-as-the-tipping-point-for-strategic-activity-6874789767184289792-fOLl">strong opinions</a>, not just his positioning)</p>
</div>

<p>So, if we‚Äôre rejecting specialization and mediocre narrow positioning - how do we generate clients? Getting a steady pipeline of clients still requires trust and visibility - but we can understand it better through this lens of ambiguous, senior work.</p>

<p>Specifically, clients need trust that you can navigate the ambiguity reliably without close supervision. And you need to be visible, not just publicly but inside their inner circles. After all this senior ambiguous work often flows through <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/12/10/weak-ties-strong-intros/">dark leads in cozy spaces</a>.</p>

<p>In the rest of this piece we‚Äôll look at how strong opinions create the kind of trust and visibility required for senior, ambiguous work.</p>

<h1 id="part-1-strong-opinions">Part 1: Strong Opinions</h1>

<p>Let‚Äôs return to the goal: sustainable client leads for well paid work without sacrificing our personal identity or narrowing our focus.</p>

<p>It turns out that having strong opinions with a distinctive vibe works remarkably well. Strong opinions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Travel well - they‚Äôre designed for distribution and visibility in our networked age</li>
  <li>Allow you to get good client/consultant fit for senior, ambiguous projects</li>
  <li>Signal a creative energy that clients are looking for to catalyze change in their organization</li>
</ul>

<p>But, unlike specialization, strong opinions don‚Äôt narrow down your options or grind against your identity as a generalist. Strong opinions allow for divergent, generative futures.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: My friend and fellow independent Behzod has a background in user research and instead of creating a strong specialization he covers all kinds of work related to user research under his studio moniker <a href="https://yetanother.studio/">Yet Another Studio</a>.</p>

  <p>He has strong opinions. He has developed a point of view on a contentious topic within the user research community - whether or not to democratize research. He takes a stand with a strong opinion: <a href="https://yetanother.studio/blog/democratization-is-our-job">Democratization is our job</a>.</p>

  <p>This single piece (which started as a podcast talk, became a conference talk and then a blog post) has generated a ton of client work for him - leads that come to him well primed not for him to ‚Äúdo user research‚Äù but to ‚Äúcreate a user research practice‚Äù - specifically the kind of senior, ambiguous work that is better paid and longer term than simply executing on a user research project.</p>
</div>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how this works:</p>

<h2 id="publishing-strong-opinions-gives-you-visibility">Publishing Strong Opinions Gives You Visibility</h2>

<p>This might seem obvious but it‚Äôs important to restate it: strong opinions are what distribution is made of. Every independent consultant should be working in public in some form - it‚Äôs how you generate awareness, clients and visibility.</p>

<p>But working in public is more than just publishing content - it‚Äôs about creating connections. We‚Äôve explored before how <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/">working in public leads to expanded connections</a> and how <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/12/10/weak-ties-strong-intros/">content drives leads even from weak ties</a>. Working in public, producing content is about creating connections. About shaping your image in other people‚Äôs eyes. It‚Äôs how you build friends, collaborators, advocates and clients.</p>

<p>The key of course is to make content that‚Äôs memorable and distinctive. In short: content that has a point of view. Whether it‚Äôs a clearly articulated point of view with a rational argument or just an aesthetic and vibe.</p>

<p>Not sure how to start? <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/02/23/small-b-blogging/">Small-b blogging</a> and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/05/17/blogpunk/">blogpunk</a> make a powerful combination.</p>

<p>How do you tell if you‚Äôre doing it right? As you build your publishing practice the only measure is connections. How many conversations are you having because of the things you publish? Forget audience size, forget pageviews - focus on crafting your voice. <strong>Focus on building a voice that makes people want to have a dialogue</strong>.</p>

<p>When you make the leap from full time employment to being independent you leave behind a lot of the traditional forms of authority - platforms are harder to access. When I worked for Distilled, an SEO agency I was speaking at 20-30 conferences a year. Since being independent I‚Äôve spoken at‚Ä¶ 4 conferences in 8 years?</p>

<p>Once the labels, platforms and access are taken away it‚Äôs much harder to create an audience, you need to create a voice for yourself.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: Lindsey Slaby is an independent consultant working on ambiguous and senior level consulting projects in the ad agency world. Lindsey specifically works at the messy areas that others shy away from: contracts, pricing, contracting, agency roster selection and more.</p>

  <p>Over the years Lindsey has developed strong opinions about how the industry works, unafraid to shine a light on uncomfortable topics or take contrary positions. For example <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lindseyslaby_advertising-procurement-agencymanagement-activity-6760586187645296640-Ib4E/">this piece on RFPs</a> and why companies should be pitching agencies (when the received wisdom is that agencies should be pitching companies!)</p>
</div>

<h2 id="vibe-fit-and-trust-in-navigating-ambiguity">Vibe Fit and Trust in Navigating Ambiguity</h2>

<p>More than raw distribution though, exposing your style and sensibility is important. Not just for standing out in the networks and generating dialogue and discussion - but also because senior, ambiguous consulting work relies on navigating a trust gap like no other.</p>

<p>Having an opinion is like having taste. It demonstrates a sensibility and way of thinking that is key when a senior client is considering a consultant for a project.</p>

<p>As we outlined in the defined/ambiguous section - ambiguous work requires an extreme amount of trust. When the situation is well defined - clients don‚Äôt need as much trust because they can control the situation more closely: they have a better understanding of what‚Äôs going on, they are able to hire replacement vendors easily and they can rely on outside experts more comfortably.</p>

<p>For ambiguous work it‚Äôs not so easy. In this case the client is relying on the consultant to both diagnose the problem AND provide potential solutions. It‚Äôs often the case that the client is operating in unfamiliar territory and needs to simply trust the consultant in all kinds of ways. There‚Äôs no easy way to replace the consultant or verify the advice being given. Simply put, oftentimes the client (and sometimes consultant!) are operating outside of normal boundaries.</p>

<p>So trust is essential - but more than that, you need to trust that the consultant will make the right decisions even faced with unknown unknowns. This kind of taste is hard to signal with a positioning statement. To develop this trust in someone without actively working with them before requires a strong understanding of the person‚Äôs point of view and vibe, which is why sharing your point of view in depth matters.</p>

<h2 id="vibes--destabilizing-energy">Vibes &amp; Destabilizing Energy</h2>

<p>More than just trust however, ambiguous work requires a specific kind of energy. Consulting is about changing clients. You‚Äôre often an outsider, brought in to catalyze some kind of change that the client has been unable to change on their own. Playing this role of catalyst (or, said more strongly: destabilizer) is challenging. Push in the wrong direction and clients will reject you. Push too hard and the client will collapse into chaos.</p>

<p>This delicate balance means that senior leaders need to know that you can put yourself in their shoes. Less like a vendor where they tell you what to do, and more like a peer that they can spar with.</p>

<p>So prospective clients need to trust that you get not just how the industry works but how their specific culture functions. They are looking for a very specific kind of energy - enough energy to change and destabilize the org, to provoke the organization to change, to create momentum for new projects. But not the wrong kind of energy to tear the client‚Äôs organization apart - creating strife and disruption.</p>

<p>In short, vibe is how you find a good client/consultant fit.</p>

<p>Building vibes is a different kind of work from specializing. You‚Äôre not just demonstrating expertise and competence but <strong><em>compatibility</em></strong>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">optimism as an operating system</a> we explore the human side of consulting and the common trap of the negative consultant. As you think about exposing your vibe you need to think carefully about how to develop opinions that have a point of view without positioning yourself with the wrong kind of destabilizing energy.</p>

<p>So we‚Äôve covered why specializing can be the wrong move, explored why having a point of view is useful for generating senior, ambiguous consulting work and why publishing and writing in public is the way to create a vibe that a client can trust and be compatible with.</p>

<p>But how do you develop a point of view? And in particular how do you do it authentically without resorting to cheap shots and portraying the wrong kind of negative destabilizing energy for potential clients?</p>

<h1 id="part-2-how-to-cultivate-a-point-of-view">Part 2: How to cultivate a point of view</h1>

<p>Developing opinions is hard. Translating opinions into a credible point of view is even harder. Doing it without pissing people off is harder still!</p>

<p>The good news is that, unlike specializing, developing opinions, crafting a point of view and building a vibe is an <strong>iterative, generative process</strong> - once you start trying out your voice there‚Äôs a feedback loop that helps you develop your voice and strengthen your point of view.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to see which parts of your experience and opinions are distinctive and resonate without sharing them. In my experience, it‚Äôs rarely the big grand vision that people are attracted to but rather something more mundane and grounded - something that has a clarity and weight about it that is distinctive.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs explore two different approaches to finding your voice and point of view: ‚Äú20% beefs‚Äù and the gap between industry and practice.</p>

<h2 id="20-beefs">20% Beefs</h2>

<p>This is a concept that <a href="https://venkateshrao.com/">Venkatesh</a> created in his email newsletter Art of Gig. I‚Äôm quoting liberally from it because it‚Äôs no longer online (with Venkat‚Äôs permission):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The top 3 articles of the hundreds I‚Äôve written, in terms of how much they drove cold inbound leads for consulting gigs, are the following. What feature do you think they have in common?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">The Gervais Principle</a> (2009): A dark/satirical take on office politics and corporate sociopathy that went hugely viral back in the day.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/venkateshrao/2012/09/03/entrepreneurs-are-the-new-labor-part-i/?sh=32d956774eab">Entrepreneurs are the New Labor</a> (2012): A cynical take on heroic valorization of founders, arguing that VCs are to founders as management to labor.</li>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs not that they are dark and satirical or contrarian. I‚Äôve written other dark/satirical or contrarian things that led to no gigs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs not that they showcase deep expertise in a subject. They don‚Äôt. In fact they largely showcase my shallow, self-taught amateurishness on the underlying topics.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs not that they offer step-by-step playbooks to solving the problems they frame. They don‚Äôt.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The correct answer is that they each pick a beef worth picking, but not too strongly.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The Gervais Principle picks a beef against feel-good ‚Äúnice‚Äù management thinking that dominated the pop-business literature at the time (I helped drive the surge of interest in darker understandings of business circa 2009-12 I think).</li>
    <li>Entrepreneurs are the New Labor picks a beef against people in the tech sector shilling what has come to be known as ‚Äúhustle porn‚Äù and flattering founders with a Hero self-image that blinds them to industry dynamics and debilitating behaviors.</li>
    <li>Fat Thinking picked a beef with the lean six-sigma crowd in big corporations, and the lean startup crowd in the startup scene.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But importantly, none of these is what you might call ‚Äúpure beef‚Äù where the fight and criticism of an opposed perspective are the main focus or content.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>They are what you might call ‚Äú20% beef.‚Äù Where the starting point is rejecting some core sacred-cow axiom of a prevailing orthodoxy, and then building something new and interesting, based on additional ideas and novel elements, on that foundation of principled dissent. It is something like rejecting Euclid‚Äôs parallel line postulate and going out on a limb to see if you can build a non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the assumptions I rejected in my 3 articles above are:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Executives are nice and managers know what they‚Äôre doing (Gervais Principle)</li>
    <li>Entrepreneurs/founders are heroes (New Labor)</li>
    <li>Efficiency and optimization are good things (Fat Thinking)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So one good answer to how to bootstrap from 0 to 1 is: indie consultants bootstrap with beefs. It‚Äôs not the only way, and it‚Äôs certainly not the safest way, but it‚Äôs a fun way that is very intellectually satisfying and validating when it works, and is the opposite of soul-destroying and dehumanizing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Venkatesh goes on to outline a bit of a ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Discovering and developing a genuine beef into an artful calling card that lands you gigs is hard work. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a costly signal. You can‚Äôt fake it by simple bullshitting.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have to put in the work of:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Spotting a widespread pattern of disillusionment in the margins</li>
    <li>Identifying the prevailing orthodoxy driving the disillusionment</li>
    <li>Analyzing its foundations</li>
    <li>Rejecting one or more flawed premises driving the disillusionment</li>
    <li>Adding imaginative alternative premises</li>
    <li>Running with it to see where the whole thing can take you</li>
    <li>Becoming conscious of what and who you‚Äôre for and against</li>
    <li>Articulating it out there in public and standing behind it.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[‚Ä¶] The work is hard not because it takes effort or time. None of those articles took me more than a couple of days to write. The work is hard because it takes a certain amount of courage and a good deal of taste. If you don‚Äôt feel a bit of an adrenaline rush, a sense of a fight-or-flight, a sense of burning bridges, while working on them, you‚Äôre not doing it right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>20% beefs are like <strong>proof of experience</strong> - you can‚Äôt properly beef with an established way of thinking without first deeply understanding the orthodoxy. And I think this is the root of the power of 20% beefs - they demonstrate taste, point of view and experience all in one.</p>

<p>You can see how this recipe from Venkatesh is literally a playbook that you can follow - first through observing your own consulting work and the disillusionment that exists in the margins (from clients, agencies, fellow consultants etc) and then later from trying out some light rejections of the orthodoxy - both in private (with clients and potential clients) and in public (by blogging).</p>

<p>This line of inquiry is a healthy one for any consultant to take anyway - it‚Äôs the role of the consultant to <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/08/18/the-fool/">play the fool</a> and take contrary positions, ask stupid questions and check the first principles of everyone‚Äôs thinking.</p>

<h2 id="the-industryreality-gap">The Industry/Reality Gap</h2>

<p>20% beef is a recipe for developing a strong opinion - but it doesn‚Äôt really give you much insight into where to look. What kind of orthodoxy should you be analyzing and rejecting?</p>

<p>Looking at successful examples of 20% beef we see that there‚Äôs a common theme of analyzing the gap between theory and industry. The unique vantage point that the consultant has is the vantage point across multiple clients - sometimes across multiple industries too.</p>

<p>Through the nature of being embedded inside organizations, consultants often get a richer, closer look at how things are actually working. This enables you to develop a more realistic view of ‚Äúhow things work‚Äù than either in-house folks (who get to see inside a limited number of companies) and agencies (who only get to see the surface level of their clients).</p>

<p><img src="/images/consultant-frame.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Behzod‚Äôs example of <em>‚Äúdemocratization is our job‚Äù</em> was developed from first seeing how research operated inside Facebook and Slack and then from consulting with a range of other startups. It‚Äôs this view of ‚Äúhow things actually are‚Äù that allowed him to develop a beef.</p>

<p>Similarly, Lindsay Slaby‚Äôs perspective of <em>‚Äúclients should pitch agencies‚Äù</em> was developed from deep experience seeing how pitches actually work, and how much clients struggle to attract top quality talent - directly straddling the client/in-house divide and seeing the challenges from both sides.</p>

<p>In every industry there‚Äôs typically some kind of received wisdom that sounds like good rational advice but simply doesn‚Äôt hold up when faced with reality.</p>

<p>The trick is to look for advice that is ‚Äúnot even wrong‚Äù - advice that is correct in a certain sense but fundamentally unhelpful when applied to reality.</p>

<p>The consultant occupies a unique position being able to see both across multiple clients AND to see further inside client organizations than agencies can. By embedding yourself deeply inside client organizations and working with senior leaders you can see the real challenges they face and how they behave - you can get underneath the surface of ‚Äúgood sounding but useless‚Äù advice.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate the point. In the SEO industry the commonly accepted way of delivering SEO work is via SEO audits. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to observe these SEO audits in practice to see that they‚Äôre commonly less than worthless.</p>

  <p>Not only has every sufficiently large organization already received several SEO audits in the past from a variety of agencies and vendors but an SEO audit is also not the most effective way to drive change and achieve SEO goals. You can see how you could construct a 20% beef perspective for the SEO industry via rejecting SEO audits as a way of delivering work.</p>
</div>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In conclusion, while the commonly accepted wisdom is to choose a niche and specialize, for many indie consultants it can be the wrong choice because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Specializing often optimizes for well defined work, which is less senior, less well paid and less interesting</li>
  <li>Specializing can grind against your identity as a generalist</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of this, I‚Äôve seen many indie consultants burn out trying too hard to fit themselves into a niche. Instead, developing a point of view and signaling a vibe can be more effective because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It optimizes for ambiguous, senior, well-paid work that is more interesting</li>
  <li>It doesn‚Äôt box you into a single identity</li>
  <li>You can iterate and explore your way towards a point of view</li>
</ol>

<p>Developing a point of view is a long journey, and it‚Äôs not easy. But it‚Äôs a more forgiving path than specializing. Recently I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/03/indie-consulting-map/">phases for indie consulting</a> and you can see how the various phases align with how you notice, develop and share your point of view:</p>

      <th>Steer by</th>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">And how to create clarity in consulting work</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>Selling consulting work is tricky - there‚Äôs a foundational inside/outside problem for consultants; how do you know enough about the client or their problems to put together a proposal?</p>

<p>Essentially you‚Äôre looking for ways to ‚Äúbridge‚Äù from outside to inside. If only you could open a portal inside their organization and take a peek‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Turns out you can - by selling a workshop.</p>

<p>My default response to all new clients over the past few years is to sell a workshop, and it‚Äôs helped me sell better work that retains for longer.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWorkshops‚Äù can mean many different things but in this post I‚Äôm going to talk specifically about designing workshops for <strong><em>clarity</em></strong> - to portal inside the client‚Äôs business and create a bridge to long-term retained work.</p>

<p>The trick is not to design these workshops to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù anything but rather to think of them as <em>jam-sessions</em> to create clarity.</p>

<p>Imagine attempting to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù brand strategy in a one-day workshop? Likely impossible. But you can create clarity.</p>

<p>And clarity is valuable - so you can charge well for these workshops if you set them up right.</p>

<p>In this post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why clarity is important for both consultant and client</li>
  <li>How to structure a workshop for outcomes, not happiness</li>
  <li>A series of conversation prompts to run effective jam-sessions</li>
  <li>Why you shouldn‚Äôt undersell yourself (aka selling one day‚Äôs work for $4,000)</li>
  <li>Some examples from my own work</li>
</ul>

<p>First though, some narrative theory‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="in-media-res">In media res</h2>

<p>‚ÄúIn media res‚Äù literally means ‚Äúin the middle of things‚Äù and it‚Äôs a narrative device that movies and books use all the time. Open with the protagonist leaping through the air between buildings, tentacles grasping mid-air behind‚Ä¶ and then figure out a way to explain what‚Äôs going on later.</p>

<p>People will have an appetite for the boring stuff once you tease the action.</p>

<p>Consulting works this way too - both client and consultant yearn for <em>in media res</em> - <strong><em>i.e. a sense of how it‚Äôs going to feel to work together.</em></strong></p>

<p>The client thinks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Can the consultant help us with these specific problems?</em></li>
  <li><em>Does the consultant know anything?</em></li>
  <li><em>Will our work-styles match or clash?</em></li>
  <li><em>Will this consultant be reliable?</em></li>
  <li><em>How do I persuade my boss to work with the consultant?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The consultant thinks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Is there a big enough project here to justify a consulting engagement?</em></li>
  <li><em>What are their real problems and can I solve them?</em></li>
  <li><em>What are their team dynamics and personalities and can I work with them?</em></li>
  <li><em>Will our work-styles match or clash?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs a foundational inside/outside problem for consultants - how do you know enough about the client to even put together a proposal? Can you trust clients to self-report their problems accurately? How do you get access as an outsider?</p>

<p>But, typically, before you can get there you need to battle through a conversation about price and contracts‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>So how do you get some sense of <em>in media res</em> for both client and consultant before wading through contract negotiation?</strong></p>

<h2 id="selling-portal-workshops">Selling Portal Workshops</h2>

<p>The trick to navigating this chicken/egg problem of contracts/context is to respond to a proposal with an initial workshop. A portal workshop.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a real example:</p>

<p><img src="/images/workshop-email-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The trick is that a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù piece of work (more on pricing later) is often an easier sell than a full retainer or larger project scope. So you can skip around the contract/context question to portal into the client‚Äôs reality and create some clarity.</p>

<p>The eagle-eyed among you might notice that the ‚Äúscope‚Äù for this workshop is incredibly loose. These aren‚Äôt workshops that have a ton of programming and heavy agenda - they should be more jam session than pre-programmed workshop.</p>

<h2 id="jam-sessions">Jam Sessions</h2>

<p>‚ÄúWorkshop‚Äù is a difficult word. People mean lots of different things and workshops can come in many flavors<sup id="fnref:flavors"><a href="#fn:flavors" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>For me, these initial workshops work best as collaborative working sessions rather than pre-programmed facilitation. Depending on the client‚Äôs comfort I‚Äôll prepare anything from a four bullet point agenda to a little prep-deck to walk through, but I find the more I pull together an agenda the worse the workshop is.</p>

<p>Invariably, the lived experience feels more like a jam session than a guided workshop. Free jazz not pop. Experience not performance. Collaborative not guided.</p>

<p>Why take this approach?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs recap the goals - with this portal into the client‚Äôs reality we‚Äôre trying to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get comfortable ‚Äúsparring‚Äù<sup id="fnref:sparring"><a href="#fn:sparring" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with the client</li>
  <li>Make the client feel that you‚Äôll listen closely</li>
  <li>Understand the real problems and make sure they will put budget against solving them</li>
  <li>Demonstrate to the client that you can help</li>
  <li>Understand the client‚Äôs team dynamics</li>
  <li>Understand the context for the work properly (i.e. what is the work, who are the people, why now)</li>
  <li>Identify client‚Äôs blind spots (their unknown unknowns)</li>
</ul>

<p>So many unknowns!</p>

<p>Without room for improvisation, sparring and discussion you won‚Äôt get enough of the context that you‚Äôre after.</p>

<p>And typically I restrict these sessions to no more than 5-6 people - beyond that it‚Äôs hard to hear the individual voices and people start to put on masks and behave differently around each other. <strong>If you want the truth, keep the group small.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conversation-prompts-for-running-an-effective-jam-session">Conversation prompts for running an effective jam session</h2>

<p>Just because it‚Äôs a free-jam session doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt prepare and think ahead to how you‚Äôll explore the client‚Äôs reality.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a few conversation prompts, guides and pointers for running an effective jam session - all designed to gain clarity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Restate the situation and goals as the first thing. Be sure to tease out any discrepancies or inconsistencies in the client‚Äôs answer. Push for specifics and don‚Äôt plaster over the cracks.</li>
  <li>The core interaction of the day is question/response, question/response. Don‚Äôt try to be linear, instead be recursive - never settle on the first answer but keep following threads until you get somewhere. Always looks for the next logical question that bridges from the last.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt look for smart questions, look for dumb questions. <em>‚ÄúOk, this might be a stupid question but why don‚Äôt we just build this the way we built the last one?‚Äù</em>. My favorite dumb question: <em>‚ÄúSeems like you have a good handle on the problem and the solution - what do you need me for?‚Äù</em></li>
  <li>Create plenty of ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù - <em>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just pretend for a moment we have the VP marketing hired, what projects do we think they‚Äôd be responsible for?‚Äù</em></li>
  <li>Be frank and to the point. <em>‚ÄúDo you believe you have the team to execute that plan? Where are the gaps?‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt the CEO sign off on the budget?‚Äù</em></li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt be afraid to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù small problems in the room - especially those where you have some domain expertise and the credibility for people to trust your answer.</li>
  <li><strong>DO be afraid to solve big problems in the room</strong>. Even if you think you have a clear solution‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt. At best you come up with a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that could work in theory, but fails to get sold in and implemented or is too generic and actually misses some context.. At worst, your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is no solution at all, is a failed solution they have already rejected, or gets taken forward as an apparent solution that falls apart later.</li>
  <li>Aggressively reframe problems <em>‚Äúok, let‚Äôs say this another way‚Äù</em> really help get to the real issues underlying the stated problems</li>
  <li>Keep a running list of discrete problems. <em>‚ÄúOK, so we‚Äôve agreed that the marketing dashboard isn‚Äôt working and needs rebuilding, analytics needs an audit as we‚Äôre not confident in it, some basic keyword research would help guide your editorial team and there‚Äôs some SEO knowledge gaps in your tech team so we should run some training‚Äù</em> - this list of problems is going to help you scope the ongoing retainer after the workshop.</li>
  <li>Dead time is the ultimate goal. Pauses to think are the whole point. Questions where there‚Äôs no trite easy answer are powerful. Let them settle in and leave the room quiet for a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="engineer-for-outcomes-not-optimism">Engineer for outcomes not optimism</h2>
<p>My favorite way to think about any workshop is that you‚Äôre here to get productive outcomes, not have a nice time.</p>

<p>This is especially true for small jam sessions like this - sure we want to know and understand that we can work together but I don‚Äôt want to hold your hand and I don‚Äôt want to shy away from questioning your thinking.</p>

<p>So think ahead of time what the potential outcomes are and what you need to know - and drive towards it.</p>

<p>Clients will more readily hire you after an exhausting and challenging workshop where everyone feels like progress was made, over a feel-good workshop where all the boxes were ticked and post-its pinned up, but ultimately no one felt like they were much further along.</p>

<h2 id="workshops-for-selling-open-ended-retainers">Workshops for selling open-ended retainers</h2>

<p>So these portal workshops help bridge the outside/inside of the consultant/client realities but what happens after the workshop?</p>

<p>Here are some unsurprising but important outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A personal relationship with the client contact</li>
  <li>A shared experience of working together (in media res)</li>
  <li>A richer understanding and awareness of the client‚Äôs context, the project‚Äôs context and the real problems the client faces</li>
  <li>A sketch and conceptual framework for how to solve the problems (or at least where to start looking for solutions)</li>
</ul>

<p>But here‚Äôs one surprising outcome:</p>

<p><strong>You can get away with a much lighter SOW (statement of work) after a good workshop</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve heard from other indie consultants and freelancers that sometimes putting together a scope or SOW and getting it approved by the client is a real point of pain - even once you‚Äôre aligned on the project and scope!</p>

<p>The negotiation is hard when you‚Äôre lacking trust and context and both parties are trying to anticipate what kinds of work and what level of detail is needed.</p>

<p>But in my experience once you‚Äôve been in a room together for a day or two negotiating a scope becomes much simpler - there‚Äôs some trust set up and context for the work that means you can write a scope such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tom to be on site to help with audience development 2 days a week</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This solves a lot of headaches<sup id="fnref:agency"><a href="#fn:agency" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>!</p>

<h2 id="4000-days---a-note-on-pricing-these-workshops">$4,000 days - A note on pricing these workshops</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs crucial not to undersell yourself for these workshops. On the one hand you could argue that since this workshop is designed to sell a long term retainer you could discount it or even deliver it for free. Certainly the economics justify it.</p>

<p>Except - this is your best chance to anchor the client on your rates. If you undersell yourself in this workshop then the chances are you‚Äôre not going to get the rate you want for the ongoing retainer.</p>

<p>So - I recommend taking your day rate and doubling it for these workshops. So if your day rate is $2,000 / day, a one-day workshop would be $4,000.</p>

<p>Since this is a relatively small amount of money (though a high day rate!) it‚Äôs often more straightforward to get sign off. And I often sell these by explaining there‚Äôs prep work, research and some kind of debrief follow-up.</p>

<p>But here‚Äôs a word of caution - if you follow this advice you might end up selling an ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù workshop and then feel anxious about the free-jam nature of it - so you decide to over-plan and over-engineer the workshop and end up settling on a more structured workshop that doesn‚Äôt deliver.</p>

<p>To get around this thinking - let‚Äôs take an example. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre an expert in brand positioning. A client is having some trouble thinking about brand marketing (maybe they‚Äôre not doing much of it right now? Or they‚Äôre thinking of hiring a head of brand?) so they engage you for a day‚Äôs workshop.</p>

<p>Now, stop and think - do you truly believe that this client‚Äôs brand marketing challenges can be solved in a day? Brand marketing is expensive! It‚Äôs slow! There‚Äôs no way you can solve this in one day.</p>

<p><strong>So what are you actually selling here? Clarity. And clarity is valuable!</strong></p>

<h2 id="four-interesting-anecdotes-from-my-own-work">Four interesting anecdotes from my own work</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to give real case studies for these workshops because so much of the work is left in the room - improv and spontaneous. But here are four interesting memories from recent work:</p>

<h3 id="five-figures-for-two-days">Five figures for two days</h3>

<p>The most expensive workshop I‚Äôve ever done was sold on an initial phone call and a one page Google Doc agenda outline. Here‚Äôs a sample to show you how bare bones the agenda was:</p>

<p><img src="/images/workshop-email-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Following this workshop we settled on a monthly retainer and I ended up working with them for over two years.</p>

<h3 id="a-workshop-that-went-sideways">A workshop that went sideways</h3>

<p>One of my most fun workshops was a one day workshop where the very first question of the day derailed the whole agenda.</p>

<p>Five people were in the room and I asked them to go around the room and explain the project in their own words. By the time we‚Äôd gone around the table there was such an obvious mismatch in expectations that we spent the whole day unpacking it - what was supposed to be an audience development workshop became more of an organizational and alignment workshop.</p>

<p>In hindsight I think I played the role of group therapy more than consultant for this one. A rigid agenda or trying to follow a script too closely would have missed the value of this freestyle session that largely <strong>exposed and clarified problems rather than solved anything</strong>.</p>

<p>Coming out of this workshop we collaborated on a few one off projects but it was clear to me that an ongoing retainer didn‚Äôt make sense unless we resolved these tensions internally at the client.</p>

<h3 id="a-workshop-full-of-silence">A workshop full of silence</h3>

<p>Recently I ran a one day workshop with lots of dead air. Awkward questions that seemed to hang in the air. At the time this workshop felt stilted, strained and perhaps unproductive - why couldn‚Äôt we get to the answers we were trying to drive towards?</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day and in the follow up it became clear that when the client confidently stated they ‚Äúknew the industry‚Äù and understood the influencers in the space they actually had a very light grasp of the players and their business, their strengths and how they functioned. They were trying to develop a strategy while missing the context they were operating in.</p>

<p>This ultimately informed almost the entire output from the workshop - the insight that more in-depth research was needed to understand the landscape more clearly and fundamentally before they could develop a strategy.</p>

<h3 id="weworkshop">WeWork(shop)</h3>
<p>Portals are tricky things. And sometimes you get stuck in-between dimensions<sup id="fnref:dimensions"><a href="#fn:dimensions" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an email I got after running a two-day workshop last year:</p>

<p><img src="/images/workshop-email-3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In fact, I will very often deliberately use the word ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äù rather than ‚Äúyou‚Äù when talking to clients to help establish a partner-style relationship rather than agency/client relationship.</p>

<p>That said - clearly in this case it didn‚Äôt land right, but I‚Äôd probably do the same again given the chance!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm sure there are many other ways to bridge the gap to the client‚Äôs reality but if there‚Äôs one thing to remember, it‚Äôs that clarity is crucial to good work.</p>

<p>So look for ways to build context and clarity by design into your workflow - either in how you get new clients, how you close them or the kinds of work that you do.</p>

<p>Whatever kind of client you‚Äôre looking for I‚Äôd encourage you to think about how you can skip to the action - is there a way to stage a mini work session and feel what it‚Äôs like to work together before committing?</p>

<p>And don‚Äôt be afraid to charge well for this work - clarity is valuable! And it sets the stage for any future work.</p>

<p>So construct a portal into your client‚Äôs reality and play some jazz.</p>

        <h1 class="posttitle" id="section3chapter2">The Consultant's Grain</h1>
        <h2 class="postsubtitle">Why (their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>You might think that being a consultant is easy. Clients hire you to help change their company in some way. You make some recommendations and provide some insights and then‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The change rarely happens like you recommended.</p>

<p>Why is that? Well, we think consulting is:</p>

<p><em>analysis -&gt; insight -&gt; recommendation -&gt; review -&gt; implementation</em></p>

<p>At best this is too simple, at worst it‚Äôs flat out wrong. The problem is just below the surface - you‚Äôre hired to change their company <strong>in a way they‚Äôve so far been unable to change</strong>. That simple addition starts to help us understand the complexity and challenges of ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù or ‚Äústrategy‚Äù.</p>

<p>In summary - the key to effective consulting is to first understand the culture within the organization that resisted this change. And then recognize which recommendations go ‚Äúwith the grain‚Äù of the organization and which go ‚Äúagainst the grain‚Äù. Going against the grain is a long slow process and requires changing people‚Äôs beliefs at scale.</p>

<h2 id="every-company-has-a-grain">Every company has a grain</h2>

<p>When you‚Äôre hired to do a job you have to understand the central question:</p>

<p><strong>Why have they been unable to make this change on their own?</strong></p>

<p>Every company has a deep rooted culture. Some talk about it explicitly, some paint it on their walls, some just breathe it everyday. But every company has a culture. And that culture comes from the people - the messy organic interactions between founders, executives, workers, passionate employees, internal writing, internal talks, external press coverage and so much more.</p>

<p>So as you think about putting together a strategy and a set of recommendations for a client you have to think clearly about whether what you‚Äôre looking to do cuts with the grain or against the grain of the organization.</p>

<p><strong>Going with the grain is fast, easy, seamless and requires moving fast and mostly just making the way forward more clear.</strong></p>

<div class="example">

  <p>Example: I recall when I was working with <a href="https://www.fundera.com">Fundera</a> a few years back and was helping them think through some content strategy. I pitched them on several concepts and themes to help elevate their content above just SEO-driven headlines. As an organization they were already primed to increase content quality and the founder Jared understood the value of content deeply so we almost instantly went from concept to details. This is a clear sign that you‚Äôre going with the grain - when you instantly get into logistics and execution. Fun fact, their series ‚Äú<a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/being-an-airbnb-host">the economics of‚Ä¶</a>‚Äù that I recommended is still running today!</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Going against the grain is hard, messy, slow and can cause friction.</strong></p>

<div class="example">

  <p>Example: I worked with a B2B saas client last year who wanted to re-balance their organization from being too sales-driven to being more marketing driven. The problem? Sales ran the show. Here, even though they were explicitly seeking help there were many organizational and cultural blockers to enable marketing to be a first class citizen within the company rather than just playing support to sales. Driving change here was messy and slow and it was increasingly obvious that what was needed was more than simply hiring a new VP of marketing.</p>

</div>

<p>But how do we understand which way the grain goes? How do you understand culture as a consultant?</p>

<h2 id="4-ways-to-better-understand-a-clients-culture">4 ways to better understand a client‚Äôs culture</h2>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could be an organizational anthropologist for a living. The undocumented everyday lives of workers within systems (and how technology plays a role) is fascinating and nuanced. There‚Äôs no real blueprint to follow here. But here are some of the ways that I‚Äôve found helpful to quickly get to the heart of what an organization‚Äôs culture <em>is</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Get close enough to smell the client</strong> - by this I mean you should be meeting with them face to face wherever possible. Sit in meetings, run workshops, sit next to them while they work, overhear them on phone calls, go for lunch with them. And the digital equivalent is just as important - don‚Äôt settle for the sanitized presentations and polished documents they send to you - get invited to their slack, get access to their internal wiki, get inside their basecamp, get under the skin and into the spaces between the work. This helps you listen and understand what‚Äôs really going on but it also allows you to observe the small things - what kinds of wins do they celebrate? Do they work cross-functionally? Are there obvious tensions between groups or people?</li>
  <li><strong>Listen to the language</strong> - language and culture are inextricably linked so one of the best ways to understand culture if you can listen to enough chatter you can pick up on repeated phrases, repeated company myths, often cited documents or projects. Listen for patterns and repetition to really get a feel for the markers by which people are judging and aligning their work.</li>
  <li><strong>Note the extreme</strong> - this is a tricky one and requires careful listening. I‚Äôve found that when dealing with execs and founders of companies, they will often use extreme examples as a way to illustrate or emphasize their point. I used to think that these extremes were deliberately used to get the change they want faster. Increasingly, however, I‚Äôm beginning to realize that these extremes are often much closer to their mental models than they might like to admit. Pay attention and work hard to synthesize why they‚Äôre using this extreme example (that sounds crazy!) and how you might actually bring it to life or implement it, there‚Äôs more truth here than they‚Äôll admit.</li>
  <li><strong>Assume everything is deliberate</strong> - Don‚Äôt assume malice, but assume that everything is as it is because someone wanted it that way. Because mostly that‚Äôs how it happens. For example - a client wanting to hire their first VP marketing might be making a good decision but remember they got this far without a VP marketing! A series of deliberate actions led them here. If they‚Äôve deprioritized something until now, ask why. What <em>have</em> they been prioritizing? That will shed light on their culture and how they think about their business. Actions speak louder than words.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="consulting-fast--slow">Consulting Fast &amp; Slow</h2>

<p>You can (and should) go against the grain of the organization. That‚Äôs where the big important work is done. I think about it as consulting fast and slow (inspired by the book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555">thinking fast and slow</a></em>).</p>

<p>Fast consulting is the aforementioned projects, ideas and change that runs with the grain where your goal is to clarify, articulate and execute.</p>

<p><strong>Slow consulting is the work that runs against the grain. I think about it a lot like running a campaign; you have to change mental models and belief systems at scale.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes you need to start grassroots and build momentum from an ever increasing number of people, sometimes it‚Äôs a focused drip drip for key execs to get them to change their mind. Either way, the key in my mind is to build an ever-increasing momentum for the direction you want to take.</p>

<p>Some ways you might campaign for change within an organization:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Send out a weekly message</strong> - A weekly email/slack/basecamp message highlighting evidence, anecdotes, case studies and more that supports your case can help change minds over long periods of time. Everyone appreciates being informed of industry trends and people love reading this kind of information (surprisingly there‚Äôs often a lack of good industry trend reading within companies).</li>
  <li><strong>Bring the outside in</strong> - Changing mental models and beliefs requires more than just telling someone. It requires showing them. Bringing the voice of the user/customer into the organization is powerful to reinforce a particular message. This can be done with focus groups or surveys but also just by surfacing and highlighting conversations on the web (i.e. twitter, quora, reddit etc).</li>
  <li><strong>Speak for the employees</strong> - In the case where the culture you‚Äôre trying to change starts at the top of the organization you are in a unique position as a consultant to identify key frustrations within the company and bring them to the attention of the execs in a way that they might actually listen.</li>
  <li><strong>Create language</strong> - Remember how language shapes culture? Well you can inject a little of your own culture by repeatedly using language, referencing examples and showcasing the direction you want to go in. This is especially true if you‚Äôre embedded within the organization and in their slack channels or working out of their office.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there‚Äôs a secret weapon I don‚Äôt see talked about much: <strong>internal blogging</strong>. Yes, I harp on a lot about blogging but seriously, serialized, shareable content is a highly effective tool for campaigning for change and helping people to see things from your point of view:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Serialized</strong> - means you don‚Äôt have to create the magnum opus or manifesto overnight. Publish your thinking, publish your half-thoughts, publish your experiments, publish your links to interesting reading. The point here is to create a drip drip drip of ideas. So publish.</li>
  <li><strong>Shareable</strong> - this is often the hardest piece to do well within an organization. Don‚Äôt let your campaign for change get trapped within an email thread or lost in the slack stream, give it a permanent home, ideally a URL (shocking I know!). How you do this will depend a lot on what your tech stack looks like. When I was working at Google you could spin up a strictly internal App Engine instance so I used it to build my own blog where I had my own URL and I could publish content. It helps when you do this to use a format that‚Äôs not commonly used internally. Standing out helps any idea gain mindshare.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only focus on one thing here though - hone in on the idea that it has to be shareable and <strong>easy to circulate</strong>. That could simply be with a google doc that has a big written ‚Äúplease distribute freely‚Äù label on it and access open to all within the company.</p>

<p>When I was at Google (pre-slack!) we used Google+ as an internal social network experience and that was effective at bubbling up disparate voices who were ‚Äúblogging‚Äù internally. As an example of what this looked like this was a great piece that made it outside the walls: <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">Steve Yegge‚Äôs platform rant</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-consultants-grain">The Consultant‚Äôs Grain</h2>

<p>Ah. There‚Äôs one more piece to this puzzle. I‚Äôve talked a lot about the organization‚Äôs grain. This was a concept I fully realized and started to deliberately address about a year and a half ago. But only more recently have I stumbled across the uncomfortable though obvious follow up: the consultant has a grain too.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs reframe that positioning of why consulting is hard - you‚Äôre hired to change their company in a way they‚Äôve so far been unable to change <strong>and you will attempt to do this in ways you‚Äôre comfortable with</strong>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to realize that businesses come in so many more shapes and sizes than you read about in the tech press. And you‚Äôll have some preconceived notions of how a business should operate, some of which may or may not work or be appropriate for a given client.</p>

<p>In short - while you can work against the grain within an organization up to a point, there is definitely a limit to the amount of friction you can generate. Too much friction and things will get set on fire. Projects, teams, people, ideas, budgets.</p>

<p>So when you‚Äôre considering change within an organization you have to understand your own bias and take a long hard look at which of your usual ideas and often-repeated mantras <strong>actually</strong> apply to this client, and which are pushing too far against the grain. And, importantly, which of your go-to ideas are explicitly <strong>with</strong> the grain of the organization.</p>

<p>Because without some kind of forward motion you‚Äôre not going to be able to stick around long enough to get the bigger change done.</p>

<p>Hopefully this piece is relevant both for external consultants and for internal change agents. If you found this interesting here‚Äôs some further reads about the consulting world that made me think recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since strategy has almost inevitably been conceived in terms of what the leaders of an organization ‚Äòplan‚Äô to do in the future, strategy formation has, not surprisingly, tended to be treated as an analytic process for establishing long-range goals and action plans for an organization; that is, as one of formulation followed by implementation. As important as this emphasis may be, we mould argue that it is seriously limited, that the process needs to be viewed from a wider perspective so that the variety of ways in which strategies actually take shape can be considered. For over 10 years now, we have been researching the process of strategy formation based on the definition of strategy as ‚Äòa pattern in a stream of decisions‚Äô</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don‚Äôt think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company‚Äôs nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it‚Äôs not thinking straight, that the organisation isn‚Äôt put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.</p>

<p>As a consultant it‚Äôs important to recognize that one of the strongest forces inside an organization is their culture. It‚Äôs why my personal mantra is a reframing of the classic:</p>

<p><em>(Their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast.</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs my theory that to be an effective consultant you need to learn how to understand culture - you need to learn <strong>ways of seeing</strong> your client‚Äôs organization. In this post I‚Äôll walk through some frameworks and concepts for doing just that.</p>

<p>But I‚Äôll go one step further and suggest that understanding an organization‚Äôs culture is <strong>the whole game</strong> and that teaching your clients to see is the ultimate pinnacle of a consultant‚Äôs work.</p>

<p>First though, a walk in London some time ago‚Ä¶.</p>

<h2 id="a-walk-with-an-anthropologist-in-london">A walk with an anthropologist in London</h2>

<p>A few years ago I was walking with a friend through the streets of London. I‚Äôd been working at Google for a while and I was frustrated at not being able to get my ideas turned into reality. My friend, a philosopher and anthropologist, just laughed at me and said: (I‚Äôm paraphrasing - sorry H)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot. There are thirty thousand people working at Google. If everyone as far down the food chain as you could get their ideas made it would be chaos. The system is explicitly designed to prevent your individual ideas from mattering one bit‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a lightbulb moment for me. Of course. Every organization is a system and process designed for certain outcomes - while some change is accepted and embraced, the point of the organization - its structure, processes and hierarchy - are there to prevent individuals from derailing the whole machine.</p>

<p>The rhetoric of ‚Äúideas can come from anywhere‚Äù and ‚Äúact like a startup‚Äù sound good but they‚Äôre just not true reflections of the lived experience inside a large organization like Google (or any other). The truth is that large organizations are both explicitly and implicitly designed to prevent too many new ideas from emerging.</p>

<h2 id="the-frustration-of-stability">The Frustration of Stability</h2>

<p>As a consultant or changemaker, this frustration can be very common. You are convinced that you have a good idea but feel unable to convince the organization. Or you have convinced the organization on an idea but feel frustrated that you just can‚Äôt get it done.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to recognize that most organizational change happens very slowly and starts very small. And this is as it should be. Consider the alternative - can you imagine an organization that was reinventing itself every time a consultant walked in the door?</p>

<p>This frustration is an emotion you can channel into focus. Changing a stable organization requires first understanding its context. And when you walk into a client‚Äôs office, you‚Äôre  always missing context. Sometimes there‚Äôs business context you‚Äôre missing - funding, acquisitions, business models. Sure. But more often it‚Äôs about missing cultural context. Your ideas are being rejected like a virus by the antibodies of the company.</p>

<p>Ever since writing <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/">The Consultant‚Äôs Grain</a> it‚Äôs become a mantra of mine that ‚Äú(their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast‚Äù. It‚Äôs a reframing of the classic ‚Äúculture eats strategy for breakfast‚Äù and it helps me stay focused - especially as a consultant coming into an unfamiliar environment and trying to get things done<sup id="fnref:grain"><a href="#fn:grain" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, the client usually isn‚Äôt paying you to understand their culture so you have to do it fast. I think this is a skill, something you can learn. This skill of sensemaking takes experience of different cultures and a strong sense of observation.</p>

<h2 id="enter-john-berger">Enter John Berger</h2>

<p>Art has a lot to teach the business world. It‚Äôs the best place to learn the skills of sensemaking and observation. John Berger had a wonderful TV show on the BBC in the 70s called ‚Äúways of seeing‚Äù. The opening scene is a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>Without talking, John walks to a renaissance painting, framed on the wall of a gallery and pulls out a knife. The gentle ripping of the canvas is all you hear as he carefully cuts out a portion of the painting. It‚Äôs a shocking scene that instantly makes you pay attention.</p>

<p>The whole thing happens in the first twenty seconds. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk">Watch it here</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/thecut.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It‚Äôs an unsettling scene - even when you know it‚Äôs coming! Recognizing why this scene is shocking helps us understand culture. No one tells you if the works on the wall are priceless. But the signals are all there - a gallery setting. A TV show about art. You‚Äôre not expecting him to walk up with a knife‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not what‚Äôs <em>done</em>.</p>

<p>John Berger goes on to talk about critical ways of understanding art, primarily through learning to critically examine something in front of you by keeping the context in frame. Who is showing this art to you? What sensory cues are there to shape your perception? How does reproduction of the image affect the image itself?</p>

<p><img src="/images/perspective.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>These questions and ways of seeing are the same exercises I employ as soon as I engage with a new client. Attempting to actually see what‚Äôs there - not what everyone around you assumes is there, and certainly not what you‚Äôre told about ‚Äúhow things work‚Äù.</p>

<p>I just came off a project where after a large acquisition there were two teams learning to work together. This caused incredible frustration for both sides - both everyday frustrations at different processes and approaches but slower moving structures below the surface about values and mental models of how the world works. These caused tensions, clashes and more.</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt pretend to have solved all of these frustrations (and I wasn‚Äôt being paid to solve these - at least not directly!) but the very first thing you can do in this situation is try and look critically and honestly at what is there.</p>

<p>Especially when you‚Äôre early in a project, before you‚Äôre supposed to have gained any knowledge it‚Äôs a great time to try and provoke some reactions (whether you go so far as slashing a painting is is up to you!). By pushing against the system in new and interesting ways you can learn a lot about the system by how it responds.</p>

<h2 id="you-need-to-get-in-the-clients-flow">You need to get in the client‚Äôs flow</h2>

<p>To understand context and get a feel for culture, you need to find ways of getting ‚Äúclose enough to smell the client‚Äù.</p>

<p>Context and culture happen at the in-between moments, spaces and projects. How does the team handle crisis? How does the team handle group meetings? What does down-time look like? How are new team members welcomed onto the team?</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre too distant from these in-between moments it‚Äôs almost impossible to properly understand the culture.</p>

<p>So as a consultant - as an outsider - it‚Äôs crucial to find ways to get embedded inside the organization. You need to get close enough to be inside the flows and streams of work. Increasingly there is a duality - the physical environment and the digital one - where different modes and types of work get to happen.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to be present in both.</p>

<p>Being physically present gives you a sense of the emotional interactions, in-between spaces and so on. It also gives you the platform necessary to build the emotional capital required to ask for favors.</p>

<p>Being digitally present gives you the tactical understanding of how projects, documents and tasks flow around. It‚Äôs also a great way to get a glimpse of the knowledge work happening around you that you aren‚Äôt directly involved in.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôre inside the flows it‚Äôs your job to pay attention.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-culture-101---what-are-we-trying-to-see">Understanding Culture 101 - what are we trying to see?</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs helpful to have some frameworks to help us think through the kinds of things we‚Äôre trying to see in the first place.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v31/acr_vol31_203.pdf">This framework from ethnography</a><sup id="fnref:ethnography"><a href="#fn:ethnography" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> is a simple and memorable framework that shows how you can think about the ways culture can manifest and reinforce itself (the four A‚Äôs):</p>

<p><img src="/images/4a.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In this framework the actors, artifacts and activities interact directly with each other. And they all exist within a wider atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Actors</strong> - these are the people in the frame. I love the word ‚Äúactors‚Äù since everyone is performing a role. The theatre of work is the epic play of our lives and the office (both physical and digital) is the stage. Notice how people behave, the language they use and their intrinsic motivations.</p>

<p><strong>Artifacts</strong> - these are the visible extensions, the ‚Äútangible‚Äù assets created by the actors. This might be everything from the design of a report to the structure of a paid leave policy.</p>

<p><strong>Activities</strong> - the things that the actors do and why they do it. These activities will tell you more about the underlying power structures. In particular, pay attention to the habits and routines that are in place. Nothing will tell you more about what people value than what they do repeatedly.</p>

<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong> - this is the wider environment in which we‚Äôre working. Is the team or organization part of a bigger structure? How is the physical office laid out? In the digital space are they using Slack or Basecamp and what is the tone of conversation there? Which design choices were put in place deliberately and who made them?</p>

<p>There are many frameworks and mental models that can help you understand and grapple with culture. ¬†‚Äù<a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/principlesmanagement/part/chapter-8-organizational-culture/">Principles of Management</a>‚Äù, chapter 8 is a great primer on organizational culture and has a model for the 8 ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù of organization culture<sup id="fnref:principles"><a href="#fn:principles" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You can imagine every organization as having each of these aspects to a greater or lesser extent. So you might think about ‚Äúplotting‚Äù a company along each axis. This is an example I put together from a recent client engagement:</p>

<p><img src="/images/org culture chart.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can see for example that I‚Äôve mapped them as ‚Äúunstable‚Äù and ‚Äúprocess oriented‚Äù - which makes sense since my role with this client engagement was to create new processes.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve found this framework helpful when trying to distinguish between things like intrinsic motivation (e.g. ‚Äúwe want to build the best X‚Äù) vs extrinsic motivation (e.g. ‚Äúwe want to beat competitor Y‚Äù).</p>

<p>Once you start plotting an organization on these dimensions of culture you can start to look at each one and think about <em>why</em> they are that way and <em>how</em> they reinforce that behavior.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-see-the-world-through-your-clients-eyes">How to see the world through your client‚Äôs eyes</h2>

<p>When you‚Äôre trying to understand a company‚Äôs culture, you‚Äôre essentially trying to understand how they see. The lens through which they process the world around them.</p>

<p>This manifests in three specific things to pay attention to: language, delusions &amp; mythology.</p>

<h3 id="language">Language</h3>

<p>The naming of things is incredibly powerful. First a group will create language as shortcuts for ideas and values - ways of thinking. But gradually this language starts to create the group. First the group creates the language and then the language creates the group. Language is the reinforcing feedback loop of culture.</p>

<p>There are two extensions from this - firstly that <strong>using the wrong language can alienate you from a group</strong>. As a consultant I try hard to use a variety of definitions, terminology and linguistic approaches. Using the wrong term once is no big deal, but <strong>consistently referring to the concept that the group has learned to reject will get you rejected as well</strong>.</p>

<p>Secondly - <strong>a skilled poet or linguist can create new language for groups. Language that has embedded values, ideas or bias from the consultant</strong>.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/itsbdell">Brian</a> calls this skill noticing and naming. It‚Äôs the essential task of the consultant to pay close attention and then attach new language to important ideas<sup id="fnref:naming"><a href="#fn:naming" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. By naming things you can drive attention to what‚Äôs important and hence shape the way an organization behaves.</p>

<p>For a wonderful poetic read on the power of language in organizations I‚Äôd encourage you to read Notes on the Role of Leadership and Language in Regenerating Organizations, a.k.a. <a href="http://pangaro.com/littlegreybook.pdf">The Little Grey Book</a>.</p>

<p>Look at this quote from <a href="http://pangaro.com/littlegreybook.pdf">The Little Grey Book</a> by Dr. Michael Geoghegan</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Managers understand the organization‚Äôs past behavior.</p>

  <p>But this knowledge,</p>

  <p>and the language that accompanies it,</p>

  <p>limit their vision</p>

  <p>of the organization‚Äôs potential future state.</p>

  <p>Using the language of the past,</p>

  <p>managers may try to provide a vision for the future.</p>

  <p>But it is an old future</p>

  <p>a memory of what the future could be.</p>

  <p>Managers may strive for fundamental change,</p>

  <p>but their language prevents them from achieving it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole book is worth reading and has tons of wisdom, especially on the pragmatic nature of introducing new language and the efficiency of old language<sup id="fnref:robin"><a href="#fn:robin" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="shared-delusions">Shared Delusions</h3>

<p>Shared Delusions - In order for teams to function effectively they need a shared mental model of how the world works for their industry/niche.</p>

<p>This mental model helps the team act quickly by working from a shared cheat-sheet of understanding. It saves having to make every decision from first principles. I like to call this mental model a ‚Äúshared delusion‚Äù.</p>

<p>Why a shared delusion? Because it‚Äôs useful to recognize that any mental model of how the world works is an incomplete model. The idea of a shared delusion is that we‚Äôre understanding head first that we‚Äôre lying to ourselves about certain things to make it easier for us to make decisions or rationalize our behavior.</p>

<p>The problem is that many mental models (i.e. shared delusions) about the world are built implicitly and not explicitly so that <strong>it becomes hard to tell which piece of the mental model is a useful simplification and which piece of the mental model is an oversimplification</strong> (or a flawed assumption).</p>

<p>So let‚Äôs call the mental model what it is - a delusion - and try and understand how we look at the mental model directly to better understand it‚Äôs limitations and flaws.</p>

<p>As a consultant - with experience likely across more industries than those inside the organization - you are in a unique position to separate out which parts of the shared mental model of the world are useful shortcuts and which are flawed ideas. Reinforce and strengthen the useful shortcuts (or make new ones) while deconstructing and weakening the flawed ideas.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll give you an example from my own work - a B2B client had seriously under-invested in design. Partly under the assumption that in the B2B space ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt as important as for B2C‚Äù and that their sites were ‚Äúgood enough already‚Äù. These kinds of assumptions about the world were repeated and interpreted differently throughout the organization but no one was challenging them directly. I wrote more about the methodology over in my post <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/10/03/how-do-you-measure-good-content/">how do you measure good content</a> but a survey against their competitors was akin to taking a knife to their painting. It sent a shock through the organization and I presented this table at an executive all-hands:</p>

<p><img src="/images/panda.png" /></p>

<p>There‚Äôs two lessons here - firstly <strong>if you want to understand shared assumptions sometimes you have to go to the source - surveying users, asking customers questions, etc</strong>.</p>

<p>Secondly - <strong>always try and create an objective counter to their subjective reality &amp; be gentle when challenging mental models - no one enjoys their view of reality being broken</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="mythology">Mythology</h3>

<p>Mythology - ¬†In times of stress, culture is a strong force that binds teams together. Culture can be the light at the end of the tunnel. Connections and bonds are formed in times of struggle and stress. From these challenging times come stories - stories of how it went down. Stories of heroics, stories of failures, stories of late nights, stories of product launches.</p>

<p>These stories become mythology within the organization. Very rarely are these documented - we‚Äôre looking for the oral history of the company and you‚Äôll often get the best version of these out of the office. (At the bar or on the walk to lunch).</p>

<p>Pay attention and listen carefully to the mythology - actively look to uncover these stories of projects past. These stories, often-repeated, contain lessons about value systems within the organization. But the lessons they tell usually bear little to no resemblance of truth of what might succeed or fail in the future.</p>

<p><strong>The key insight here is that every single new project will get compared to the myths. So you can‚Äôt understand the context of your ideas and recommendations without first understanding the mythology.</strong></p>

<p>Tread lightly when following the footsteps of glory or failure - both are dangerous paths to follow.</p>

<h2 id="culture-vs-propaganda">Culture vs Propaganda</h2>

<p>Beware documented culture. For all of this talk about company culture I‚Äôve found that it can be misleading to rely on mission decks and documented company values. These are top-down objects that are at best out of date and usually contain at least one statement that is the opposite of the truth<sup id="fnref:kit"><a href="#fn:kit" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. A mandate rather than an observation. (After all the only reason to document culture is to change it.)</p>

<p>My favorite illustration of corporate propaganda is Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äúculture‚Äù of ‚Äúmove fast with stable infrastructure‚Äù. It‚Äôs a mock up of a poster that Zuckerberg is showing at a conference where the letters are on screen taller than he is, literally larger than life:</p>

<p><img src="/images/propoganda.png" /></p>

<p>The interesting thing is that the only images you can find are the keynote mockups of the poster. There appear to be no <em>actual</em> posters of this manifesto.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd go further and say that it is an impossible object. It‚Äôs impossible to make a poster with this phrase on. Why? Because anyone (and especially Facebook employees) who reads this poster is actually translating it in their mind into the <em>actual</em> poster of ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù. Nothing has changed about their culture.</p>

<p>So seek out the internal culture decks, they‚Äôre useful starting points. Consume them. But don‚Äôt trust them.</p>

<h2 id="three-breakthroughs">Three Breakthroughs</h2>

<p>The <strong>first breakthrough</strong> I had as a consultant was to understand that there is very little objective truth in business. What works for one business doesn‚Äôt always work for another. Every strategy is a reflection of the business you‚Äôre working with and the environment they‚Äôre in. There is no ‚Äújust do X‚Äù recommendation in the real world, only in dusty, discarded strategy documents. This quote has stuck with me from Tomasz Tunguz‚Äôs <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/overfitting-in-business/">Overfitting in Business</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As I study and meet and analyze more and more businesses, I find myself drawn to the idea that each is a snowflake. Each startup is unique composition of its team, in the circumstances of its genesis, and the ecosystem in which it blossoms. Business concepts like the ones mentioned above can provide a common language about ideas. They can help us tell stories to motivate and inspire. Perhaps, they can provide some form of analytical framework.</p>

  <p>But until the success of these theories can stand the test of reproducibility or time, that‚Äôs all they should be. After all, even some of the most successful CEOs in the world cannot reproduce their success the second time or third time. Building a business is really hard, and building an enduring company even more so, because each enduring business is built in a different way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>second breakthrough</strong> I had was to understand that there is a depth to observing a business. Learning ways of seeing, recognizing culture as a powerful force and attempting to observe the realities of the organization rather than passively taking for granted the received wisdom leads to strong insights.</p>

<p>Without ways of seeing the premise of consulting falls apart - you make generic recommendations that are easily rejected by the organizations belief systems and culture. Recommendations that fail to create new language or any meaningful change.</p>

<p>The <strong>third breakthrough</strong> I had - from reflecting on past client engagements, sometimes lasting years - was that the most important and most meaningful work I‚Äôve done for clients is to help them see. Help them see their own culture in new ways, or help them see the world around them.</p>

<p>By sharing these ways of seeing with your client you can develop a shared perspective of the road ahead.</p>

<h2 id="teaching-your-client-to-see">Teaching your client to see</h2>

<p><em>‚ÄúA people or a class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act as a people or a class than one that has been able to situate itself in history.‚Äù - John Berger</em></p>

<p>And so, finally we arrive back where we started. How do you teach ways of seeing? How do you challenge assumptions, create new contexts or add new naming?</p>

<p>Watching Ways of Seeing the first time was useful to help me see. The second time was useful to help me teach others how to see.</p>

<p>Re-watch the first twenty seconds. We can hear the gentle ripping of the canvas in a new perspective. Why is this scene so unsettling? Why is it effective?</p>

<p>So take a good look at the client and when you are seeing clearly, take a knife to the walls and help them see what‚Äôs there.</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">And the power of making simple, true frameworks with clients</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>In this post I‚Äôm going to argue that bringing pre-existing off-the-shelf models and frameworks to my client work is the <strong>biggest mistake I‚Äôve made in the past two years</strong>.</p>

<p>A framework as I‚Äôm going to refer to it in this post is essentially a useful abstraction. A tool for thinking about a situation that allows teams to use a shared mental model and a shared vocabulary.</p>

<p>In my post <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/29/ways-of-seeing/">ways of seeing</a> - I explored the idea of deeply understanding a client‚Äôs organization and culture to better understand how they see the world.  I ended with the idea that ‚Äúteaching a client new ways of seeing is the pinnacle of consulting‚Äù.</p>

<p><em>But how exactly do you teach clients how to see?</em></p>

<p>The answer is frameworks. Douglas Hofstadter claims <em>analogy is the core of cognition</em><sup id="fnref:analogy"><a href="#fn:analogy" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and I‚Äôd stretch that to say <em>frameworks are the core of cognition for organizations</em>.</p>

<p>A good framework is a tool for thinking. A shared mental model of a situation is powerful and deeply transformative, especially at the management layer where they spend most of their time in abstractions.</p>

<p>Something like aggregation theory from Ben Thompson is a good example of a pre-existing framework that you might be tempted to reference in client work.</p>

<p>But, to be successful a good framework needs to be simple, true and co-created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple because it needs to be easy to reference and talk about without having to explain it</li>
  <li>True because it needs to be the right way of thinking about a situation - not just sound nice</li>
  <li>Co-created with the client to ensure they have ownership and buy-in</li>
</ul>

<p>Off the shelf frameworks have a hard time meeting any of these three goals, and in particular can be dangerous when applied to the wrong problem. And it‚Äôs only recently that I really began to understand why existing generic frameworks like ‚Äújobs to be done‚Äù don‚Äôt meet my needs.</p>

<p>A strong framework is a powerful tool.</p>

<p>And for extra impact get good at naming them and embedding them in processes to achieve the outcomes they want.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to try and walk through what this all means, show four case studies from my consulting work and end on some ways you can practice making frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="definitions-of-models--frameworks">Definitions of Models &amp; Frameworks</h2>

<p>First, let‚Äôs lay the groundwork and set some definitions - in particular let‚Äôs try and differentiate between the concept of a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù and a ‚Äúframework‚Äù.</p>

<p>The dictionary <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/framework">defines a framework</a> as:</p>

<p>a system of rules, ideas, or beliefs that is used to plan or decide something</p>

<p>This is close to what we need - but doesn‚Äôt quite capture the notion of abstraction that I think is key for our uses. Let‚Äôs re-state as:</p>

<p><strong><em>A framework is a system of rules, ideas, beliefs or interactions that abstract a situation and can be used to make decisions.</em></strong></p>

<p>Frameworks are usually scale invariant. I.e. they abstract a system to its core relations, categories and interactions. Then, we can think of a model as a framework that allows for calculation with inputs and outputs:</p>

<p><strong><em>A model is an analytical framework - i.e. one that embeds an algorithm or set of calculations such that inputs and outputs can be adjusted to interrogate the system.</em></strong></p>

<p>I realize this is slightly hard to parse and in fact there are so many different uses for the words framework and model. In particular - I think of a ‚Äúmental model‚Äù as actually most of the time being a framework<sup id="fnref:vgr"><a href="#fn:vgr" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Mostly for this post I‚Äôm just going to use the word ‚Äúframework‚Äù everywhere - it‚Äôs loose but lets us talk about them all together. They‚Äôre all tools for thinking. They‚Äôre all in the consultant‚Äôs toolkit.</p>

<h2 id="intro-why-frameworks-are-so-powerful">Intro: Why frameworks are so powerful</h2>

<p>Frameworks are powerful. They help us make sense of situations<sup id="fnref:models"><a href="#fn:models" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But frameworks are more than mere representations. As Dubberley suggested, we use frameworks to make sense of and think through the world. A framework can help us break down the constituent elements in a phenomenon ‚Äì or group of phenomena - which then makes it easier to think about their inter-relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, they help us communicate more easily about those situations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet beyond being (cognitive) labour saving devices frameworks have another obvious virtue. They provide a shared intellectual scaffolding: a common ground upon which people can interact and engage. In that sense frameworks have communicative virtuosity - they are good to talk with. They allow ideas to be shared.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both quotes from this excellent short read: <a href="https://www.epicpeople.org/pblog19/">Models of enchantment and the enchantment of models</a> from Simon Roberts.</p>

<p>The essence of consulting is navigating unfamiliar organizations to both make sense of existing beliefs, systems and processes while simultaneously helping the organization develop new beliefs, systems and processes. This dual process of sensing and changing is a delicate one.</p>

<p>Unless you‚Äôre operating with a team of 4 analytical consultants (like a Bain or McKinsey might) there‚Äôs basically no way you can perform a ‚Äúfrom first principles‚Äù analysis of the client‚Äôs organization<sup id="fnref:big4"><a href="#fn:big4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. So you‚Äôre going to need some shortcuts.</p>

<p>Frameworks provide the shortcut to making sense of an organization <strong>and</strong> for proposing and socializing new ideas.</p>

<p>But as is always the case with shortcuts, you need to choose your path wisely. Things that look like shortcuts can get you lost‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="the-failure-of-pre-existing-frameworks">The Failure of Pre-existing frameworks</h2>

<p>The biggest mistake I‚Äôve made is bringing pre-existing frameworks with me to a client gig. Pre-existing frameworks are problematic for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a) They‚Äôre typically the wrong framework</li>
  <li>b) They‚Äôre usually overly complex</li>
</ul>

<p>Pre-existing frameworks are often complex tools. They‚Äôre designed to handle many different situations and organizations within a ‚Äúmaster‚Äù framework so necessarily have to handle many edge cases and environments. They‚Äôre complex by design.</p>

<p>But this complexity often means they get used incorrectly.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take one I see a lot - the ‚Äújobs to be done‚Äù framework. I hear this referenced on almost every client project I work on in some context. But typically it‚Äôs the wrong framework because we‚Äôre not analyzing a complete jobs to be done analysis but instead we‚Äôre analyzing a specific user need or a functional UX. Yes you <em>could</em> use the JTBD framework here but it‚Äôs heavy handed.</p>

<p>Secondly - it‚Äôs overly complex. The JTBD framework is nuanced, layered and comes with tons of theory<sup id="fnref:kale"><a href="#fn:kale" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And, by the way, if you‚Äôre using an off-the-shelf framework like JTBD then you‚Äôre missing the chance to name your own framework. This dramatically reduces the influence you can have within an organization.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-simple-frameworks">The Power of Simple Frameworks</h2>

<p>So if jobs-to-be-done is too complex, what‚Äôs a good simple framework?</p>

<p>I‚Äôd propose that for most indie consultants and strategic independents the right complexity is a single idea or concept. Create the most reduced, simple, brain-dead framework that you can find and stick to it.</p>

<p><a href="https://janchipchase.com/">Jan Chipchase</a> outlines this tension nicely (bolding mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú<strong>A framework is a way of organising information that supports comprehension and recall. A well-designed framework can communicate both simple and complex ideas without overwhelming the reader</strong>. While there are many widely used frameworks that have stood the test of time, every project has unique raw materials that can lead to something new.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A framework, even one that appears at first glance to be mundane, has the potential to reveal the world in a new light</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It takes time to tease out the optimal framework, from the first inkling of an idea run by the team to stress-testing the model to see it if stands up to new data. <strong>Novices tend to become enamoured by high-concept/low-data frameworks that take an additional cognitive effort to process and are light on insight</strong>.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:fieldguide"><a href="#fn:fieldguide" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple frameworks are easier to communicate, travel faster inside an organization and have fewer barriers to adoption. But what Jan highlights here is that novices become enamoured with high-concept/low-data frameworks - or frameworks that tease the wrong insight.</p>

<p>High concept frameworks are almost by definition worthless - a framework is an abstraction designed for simplifying and socializing an idea and if it‚Äôs hard to grok then it doesn‚Äôt help people think or help it spread.</p>

<p>Frameworks that tease the wrong insight are what I call ‚Äúun-true‚Äù frameworks and they‚Äôre another story‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-true-frameworks">How to create true frameworks</h2>

<p>Un-true frameworks are things that sound nice but simply aren‚Äôt saying the right thing<sup id="fnref:leaky"><a href="#fn:leaky" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. This is partly why off-the-shelf frameworks are dangerous, because they likely don‚Äôt say the thing that the organization needs.</p>

<p>True frameworks are those that are grounded in a very real, practical and necessary insight about the organization, their users or the situation at hand.</p>

<p>This idea of a ‚Äútrue framework‚Äù is something that I picked up at a recent <a href="https://studiodradiodurans.com/pages/sensemaking-for-impact-masterclass">sensemaking for impact masterclass</a> from Jan Chipchase of Studio D fame.</p>

<p>Jan walked through his process of turning raw ethnographic interviews into insights and frameworks in a way that generates a throughline from raw research to final deliverable.  It looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/jan-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>He showed a wall covered in insights gathered from field research - these interviews had generated a ton of little snippets of ideas - these could be insights, quotes or other nuggets. Where every single insight is tagged to the original specific interview that generated it so there‚Äôs a throughline from raw interviews to final presentation / output.</p>

<p>He then showed a time-lapse of the sense-making process of turning that wall of insights into clusters of themes. These clusters are what I think most people imagine the sense-making process looks like; conduct interviews, extract insights, cluster and present.</p>

<p>But there was a third wall in the time-lapse video - one for frameworks.</p>

<p>The frameworks wall is nothing more than sheets of A4 paper with sharpie doodles, diagrams and ideas on them. The rule is that you start making a simple line sketch or even just a name for a potential framework - one per page. And during the course of the user research process you refine the frameworks and get rid of the ones that are too complicated or non essential.</p>

<p>Then the crucial step happens last - as the field research nears an end you take stock of the frameworks on the wall and for those that you want to include in the final report you stress-test those frameworks in-field with real users. This ensures that the frameworks are true - they contain real things that map to real users expectations, behaviours and ideas<sup id="fnref:jantweet"><a href="#fn:jantweet" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example framework from some Studio D work<sup id="fnref:paddy1"><a href="#fn:paddy1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/paddy-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you look you can imagine the process here from interviews with farmers -&gt; insights -&gt; frameworks like the above.</p>

<p>Why is this important for consultants? Because it shows the power, and the difficulty, of creating true frameworks. Things that have the power to change an organization in the right way and that are tested with real users.</p>

<h2 id="true-frameworks-emerge-from-client-ethnographies">True Frameworks emerge from client-ethnographies</h2>

<p>I imagine most indie consultants and strategic independents are looking at this like I‚Äôm crazy - who has time for a multi-week ethnographic study in the middle of your consulting work?</p>

<p>But here‚Äôs the thing - every time you‚Äôre on-site with a client‚Äôs organization you‚Äôre studying the people, the behaviours, the motivations. You‚Äôre asking questions of as many people as you can.</p>

<p>This is all a light-touch ethnographic study of the client‚Äôs organization.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve written before about the need to get close enough to a client to understand the ‚Äúgrain‚Äù of the organization. You can see how without this close-sensing of the client it‚Äôs impossible to pick up on the ethnographies needed to construct these frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="categorization-is-for-experts">Categorization is for experts</h2>

<p>Scanning the kinds of frameworks that Jan Chipchase showed from his work it was clear that while some were novel diagrams or well designed maps, the majority of them seemed like very simple tables and charts. Like this<sup id="fnref:paddy2"><a href="#fn:paddy2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/paddy-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>See how the simple categorization above of day labourers allows for the creation of new language (‚ÄúArchetype 06 - Risk-averse Day Labourer‚Äù) and a lens through which future data sets, decisions and problems can be viewed.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs not obvious exactly why these dimensions were chosen on which to categorize day labourers. Why segment them by the length of their world view?</p>

<p><strong>The answer is that categorization is an expert skill</strong>.</p>

<p>You need to be able to comprehend an entire system to be able to categorize things effectively<sup id="fnref:experts"><a href="#fn:experts" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>A categorization in turn can embed and scale your expertise across an organization</strong>.</p>

<p>In cases where the consultant has some domain expertise (not always true) and they‚Äôre coming in to help an organization adapt or build new processes the first go-to tool should be a simple categorization. Simple of course, refers to the simplicity of the framework, not of the knowledge and expertise that went into <em>choosing</em> the categorization.</p>

<p>But as an expert you can‚Äôt simply force your expertise on the client. Instead you need to build the framework together‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="co-creating-frameworks-makes-them-stick---aka-the-ikea-effect">Co-creating frameworks makes them stick - aka the IKEA effect</h2>

<p>We‚Äôve shown that we want to make our own frameworks, they should be true and they should often be simple categorizations. Now, I want to show you how co-creating them with clients is the ultimate key to allowing them to be socialized, adopted, referenced and ultimately drive change in an organization sometimes for years to come.</p>

<p>This is the IKEA effect - the idea that you‚Äôre much more invested in cheap furniture that you built with your own hands than fancy furniture that comes pre-assembled<sup id="fnref:ikea"><a href="#fn:ikea" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The same is true for frameworks. It‚Äôs ok to do the work of sensemaking on your own but it‚Äôs better to do it with the client. If you co-create it with the client you get three pleasing effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firstly <strong>you avoid almost-true frameworks</strong>. The client almost certainly knows more than you do and has an awareness for the corporate memory so can help you avoid evolutionary dead ends that might not be immediately obvious.</li>
  <li>Secondly by co-creating with the client <strong>you get at least one senior member of the organization fully immersed in the theory</strong>, not just the summary of the framework. Remember frameworks are abstractions - by design - but you want at least someone who understands the whole system not just the abstraction</li>
  <li>Thirdly, because the client co-created it with you <strong>they are proud of their work</strong> and far more likely to use, reference and share the framework than if you hand it to them fully formed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-example-of-a-simple-co-created-categorization-framework-embedded-in-a-process">An example of a simple, co-created categorization framework embedded in a process</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a real example from some client work last year.</p>

<p>Problem: the client is creating a bunch of content and looking to scale up their content production but their existing performance is very mixed and overall not meeting expectations.</p>

<p>Solution: frameworks to the rescue! (how did you guess I was going to say that?)</p>

<p>After a day or so workshop with the client and the editor in chief we co-created a simple categorization for their content to better help them the user intent for a keyword before they created the content.</p>

<p>The categorization looked something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/grade-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And this gets embedded and referenced in the master content schedule by assigning every article a grade (A,B,C,D in the second column) or categorization:</p>

<p><img src="/images/grading-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This framework helped them write stronger briefs, invest more strongly into areas of competition and also track and monitor performance on a more granular level.</p>

<p>Importantly - note the difference here between a situation where as the consultant you say <strong>‚Äúyou should make better content‚Äù</strong> and a day-long process of understanding the failure of their existing content process, co-creating a simple categorization, testing that categorization against historical data and then creating the changes in the process doc and working that through with the editor in chief.</p>

<h2 id="an-example-of-an-accidental-framework-that-became-socialized">An example of an accidental framework that became socialized</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs another example of a more visual framework. Also from my own work last year. This one was an accidental success (and really was the genesis for all of my framework thinking since).</p>

<p>A large media company needed to get better at commerce content fast. They needed a better understanding of how it worked and a better plan for executing it.</p>

<p>I put together a strategy deck (30-40 slides maybe) and, in reality the whole thing could be boiled down to ‚Äúslide 6‚Äù which stopped the meeting dead and became the reference object for the whole project. Here it is:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vpn-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is simple, but importantly it‚Äôs TRUE. Note the 70/30 revenue split? These numbers were based on another property they owned so they had reason to believe it and think it a true framework.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ deceptively simple. And actually pretty hard to do in practice (despite everyone buying into the strategy from top to bottom they ended up completely ignoring the box on the far right. Oh well.)</p>

<p>One thing missing here was a good name - over time it was referenced as <em>‚Äúslide 6‚Äù</em> (it wasn‚Äôt slide 6) or <em>‚Äúthat diagram you showed‚Äù</em>. This is clearly sub-optimal and I think a better name (especially one that emphasized the holistic nature of doing all of this at once) would have helped the framework get executed fully.</p>

<h2 id="an-example-of-a-simple-framework-that-creates-a-model">An example of a simple framework that creates a model</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a lovely simple example I‚Äôve referenced many times over the past few years.</p>

<p>Problem: a client needed a way to maintain content quality as they scaled up dramatically. They published long-form product reviews.</p>

<p>After locking ourselves in a room for a day (notice a common theme?) we flipped the concept of defining quality and instead created a minimum threshold for our content to meet:</p>

<p><img src="/images/benchmark-framework.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Does this benchmark seem overly simple to you? Good! Five bullet points that allow you to grade a piece of content to say ‚Äúthis meets our standards or doesn‚Äôt‚Äù is exactly the simple useful thing we needed.</p>

<p>Later, we translated this into a scoring system - get 4/5 people in a room and have them all rate the same article 1-10 on each of these bullets and you can say ‚Äúthis article is 7/10‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is 6.4 / 10‚Äù. This descriptive power is turning the abstract framework into a more quantitative model.</p>

<p>And of course, note the co-creation.</p>

<h2 id="with-great-power-an-example-of-a-framework-that-made-its-own-meaning">With great power‚Ä¶ an example of a framework that made its own meaning</h2>

<p>With great power comes great responsibility‚Ä¶ Who recognizes the following situation: you present a body of work to an executive team and one item - either a throw-away phrase or a single idea ‚Äústicks‚Äù with an executive and they grab hold of the language and suddenly every meeting they‚Äôre in they‚Äôre using this one phrase, most of which is entirely out of context or irrelevant.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve definitely been in this situation. It‚Äôs painful for two reasons - firstly because your framework had a real use and a real intended meaning and that‚Äôs now impossible with the executive bastardization. But also - it causes confusion and frustration with the employees who can often recognize that the framework the exec is forcing on them doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example from a few years ago - in the middle of an exec strategy read out I referenced the <a href="https://brendangahan.com/hero-hub-hygiene/">hub, hero, habit framework</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/hub-hero-framework-mistake.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In truth - this was my fault. I‚Äôd had a longer strategy deck I‚Äôd prepared that got slimmed down and I‚Äôd left in the reference to the framework without the explanation of how it would work in application for that client.</p>

<p>The fallout was that the ‚Äúhub, hero, habit‚Äù framework was referenced by the leadership team in repeated ways but without any real directive, causing confusion for the teams. I don‚Äôt think any meaningful action happened as a result[empty].</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-get-better-at-this-doodling--diagrams">How do you get better at this? Doodling &amp; Diagrams.</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôve read this far hopefully you‚Äôre bought into the idea that frameworks are useful and effective. So‚Ä¶ how do you get better at making them?</p>

<p>As I think about the last few years of my own work and I try and understand my own thinking I‚Äôve come to the answer that doodling and diagrams are the way to evolve your thinking.</p>

<p>You can think of it as something like:</p>

<p><strong>Doodles -&gt; Diagrams -&gt;  Frameworks -&gt; Models</strong></p>

<p><em>(Yes, this is a framework!)</em></p>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example - this post:</p>

<p>Was a simple doodle that turned into a mini framework of sorts for thinking through my consulting work and led to the idea of ‚Äú<a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/07/25/media-design/">media design</a>‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the projects I‚Äôve seen fail have failed because they have been too focused on one axis of the spectrum and the strategy or execution hasn‚Äôt acknowledged the full system - from ignoring the brand implications of the content to not fully understanding the human editors who have to execute a vision.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Media Design is about designing for success by looking at the system and how the parts interplay to make each perform better by bringing them into a shared context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôve been following and collecting interesting visual thinkers for a while and I‚Äôve collected a few of my faves here:</p>

<h3 id="venkatesh-rao---ribbonfarm">Venkatesh Rao - Ribbonfarm</h3>

<p>Venkatesh consistently flirts with the boundaries of reality with his doodling, diagramming and thinking. One thing I love about his work is that he‚Äôs not afraid to switch between hand-drawn doodles, powerpoint diagrams and flowcharts (or any other medium you can think of).</p>

<p>This one is a particular favorite of mine, <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2018/07/19/quiver-doodles/">quiver doodles</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/quiver-venkatesh.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This recent post <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">the extended internet universe</a> actually has multiple different mediums of visual thinking - drawing, 2x2, constraint triangle.</p>

<h3 id="naheeapp---mildly-nsfw">Nahee.App - (mildly NSFW)</h3>

<p>You didn‚Äôt think you were going to get through this post without some cyberfeminism did you? This is out of left field but it‚Äôs my hands-down favorite Instagram account right now. Feminism, sex, diagrams, process flows and more. Hard to describe and mildly NSFW but mind-expanding:</p>

<p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nahee.app/">@nahee.app</a></p>

<h3 id="ben-thompson---stratechery">Ben Thompson - Stratechery</h3>

<p>Ben Thompson is pretty well known both for his doodles and for his frameworks. Here‚Äôs a diagram from his most famous <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">aggregation theory</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM-1200x515.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you look at all of their work you can see how convoluted or involved ideas become simpler and simpler over time as they boil them to their essence. Aggregation theory is an excellent example of this from Ben Thompson. (but remember! The goal is to create your own frameworks, not stuff aggregation theory into every strategy deck you make).</p>

<p>By the way these are all archived and will hopefully be maintained over on my wiki: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/strategy-consulting/diagrams/">wiki/diagrams and doodles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="naming-frameworks---compress-to-impress">Naming Frameworks - Compress to Impress</h2>

<p>A key factor for the success of frameworks is their ability to travel - the ability for a simple framework to be repeated, referenced and leaned on while you‚Äôre not in the room.</p>

<p>Giving your framework a strong name is essential to the spread of the concept - and Eugene Wei has an excellent post on this with the appropriately catchy title <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/5/11/jpeg-your-ideas">compress to impress</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThere will come a day when you‚Äôll come up with some brilliant theory or concept and want it to spread and stick. You want to lay claim to that idea. It‚Äôs then that you‚Äôll want to set aside some time to state it distinctively, even if you‚Äôre not a gifted rhetorician. A memorable turn of phrase need not incorporate sophisticated techniques like parataxis or polysyndeton. Most everyone in tech is familiar with Marc Andreessen‚Äôs ‚Äúsoftware is eating the world‚Äù and Stewart Brand‚Äôs ‚Äúinformation wants to be free.‚Äù Often mere novelty is enough to elevate the mundane. You‚Äôve spent all that time cooking your idea, why not spend an extra few moments plating it? It all tastes the same in your mouth but one dish will live on forever in an Instagram humblebrag pic.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So‚Ä¶ do as Eugene says - spend a few minutes plating the framework<sup id="fnref:naming"><a href="#fn:naming" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This is an area that I‚Äôm deliberately trying to get better at (note how all of my above examples lacked good naming‚Ä¶ ). Naming is not a strong suit of mine but I think studying language, poetry and memes is a good start‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Two good resources for naming things (though both are slightly more focused on naming ‚Äúbrands‚Äù I think the concepts are solid):</p>

<h2 id="models-of-enchantment--embedding-ideology">Models of Enchantment &amp; Embedding Ideology</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.epicpeople.org/pblog19/">wonderful article</a> I quoted early in this post from Simon Roberts is going to crop up again here (bolding mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Models cause people to ‚Äúperceive social reality in a way favourable to the social interests of the enchanter‚Äù</strong> (Gell 1988: 7). I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd like to think that our interests are coterminous with those of the people we advise. More often than not I suspect they are. <strong>But isn‚Äôt it worth remembering the power our models have over those we provide them to and how they exert that power</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps more importantly it‚Äôs worth reflecting on the sometimes restrictive and constraining power that our models might exert over their creators. In pursuit of certainty in the face of uncertainty, is it not sometime the case that the enchanter becomes the enchanted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As per my older piece <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/">the consultant‚Äôs grain</a> every time we enter a project we need to understand that we bring our own biases, ideas and ideologies to the table. And frameworks are an excellent way of embedding ideology inside an organization. So tread carefully.</p>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary‚Ä¶</h2>

<p>Thanks for sticking with me for this long-ish post. Like I mentioned early on - attempting to force pre-built frameworks into my consulting work has been a major error in the past few years and so I‚Äôm still course-correcting and relatively new to building my own. If I could explain this better I‚Äôd have written a shorter post‚Ä¶</p>

<p>To recap where we got to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Frameworks are simple tools for thinking that can create a shared world view and be easily referenced</li>
  <li>The first instinct of many consultants is to grab a framework that you‚Äôve heard of but this causes problems in three ways:
    <ul>
      <li>They‚Äôre too complex</li>
      <li>They‚Äôre not relevant enough</li>
      <li>You didn‚Äôt make it so there‚Äôs little attachment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instead I believe you should be making your own frameworks and they you should focus on:
    <ul>
      <li>Simple frameworks (even a simple categorization is a framework)</li>
      <li>True frameworks that say something about the client‚Äôs business</li>
      <li>Co-creating them with clients so you get the IKEA effect</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I‚Äôm still figuring it out but I believe doodling, sketching, notebook diagrams and visual thinking can help you get better at making frameworks</li>
  <li>And, finally, for maximum effectiveness you need to focus on memorable names - compress to impress.</li>
</ul>

  <p><em>‚ÄúIt is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor‚Äôs job is to be helpful.‚Äù David Maister - The Trusted Advisor</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>‚ÄúI can DO IT!‚Äù</em> my 7 year old screams at me. She asked for help with her homework, but now - half way through explaining the place value of numbers - she had enough of my help and was physically and emotionally pushing me away - <em>‚ÄúI can DO IT already‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, she proceeded to not be able to do it.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúYes I know that!‚Äù</em> I shouted in exasperation. I was making pancakes for the kids and had only skim-read the recipe. As a result I had forgotten to melt the butter before adding it to the mixture and it was all lumpy. My partner Erin looked over and said <em>‚Äúyou should have melted the butter before you put it in, would you like me to give you a recipe?‚Äù</em>. I had a recipe, but obviously I hadn‚Äôt followed it and knew that I had made a mistake. <em>‚ÄúI KNOW I should have melted the butter, that‚Äôs not helpful to me right now!‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>Giving advice is emotionally fraught and complicated. It‚Äôs true for 7 year olds, it‚Äôs true for me and it‚Äôs true for my clients.</p>

<p>Giving advice is an intensely personal thing. The feeling of learning something new sits right next to the feeling of shame for not knowing it in the first place. And worse, in the client/consultant relationship, the client is at least partially complicit in the situation when they come to you.</p>

<p>So, some of the things that might seem ‚Äúobvious‚Äù to you as a consultant can actually be incredibly delicate and problematic. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quickly pointing out potential problems with the situation</li>
  <li>Immediately offering a solution to these problems</li>
  <li>Stating that things are easily solved</li>
</ul>

<p>You do these things because you want to be seen as an expert, you want to reassure the client that you have the answer and that the client is in good hands.</p>

<p>But think carefully about how these things make the client feel. They can make the client feel stupid, it can place a fair share of blame on the client for the situation and it can make them feel like you didn‚Äôt listen carefully enough to their description of the problem before leaping to solutions.</p>

<p>So in this chapter we‚Äôre going to look at ways to <strong>resist the urge to add immediate value</strong>. Instead we have to hold space for a more vulnerable, honest and open relationship with our client - to allow them to open up more fully and to work on things that are useful, even if not in scope.</p>

<h2 id="from-consultant-to-advisor">From Consultant to Advisor</h2>

<p>In the book Trusted Advisor by David Maister (highly recommended!) there is a a nice illustration that shows the evolution of client/consultant relationships as you get more senior and more strategic:</p>

<p><img src="/images/advice.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Giving advice is fraught even if the problem is well defined and you <em>do</em> know the answer. So when you‚Äôre working on strategic, ill-defined projects where there isn‚Äôt a <em>right</em> answer - giving advice is incredibly delicate, and in some cases not even possible.</p>

<p>Eventually in your career you might even stop thinking of yourself as a consultant and start thinking of yourself as an advisor.</p>

<p>And as we see in the diagram - <strong>in order to get access to the deeper emotional layers of advice giving and receiving we need to formulate a close relationship with our clients</strong>.</p>

<p>While giving advice can help you be seen as knowledgeable, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily build trust.</p>

<h2 id="you-should-is-a-dangerous-phrase">‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù is a dangerous phrase</h2>

<p>One of the biggest mistakes a consultant can make is to think that you‚Äôre there to give advice and solve client problems. It‚Äôs so easy to let this little phrase creep into your work:</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a simple sounding phrase but it gets you in trouble more often than not. It‚Äôs problematic for two reasons: it assumes a control of client resources and it‚Äôs too prescriptive in form:</p>

<h3 id="1-you-should-assumes-you-can-allocate-client-resources">1. ‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù assumes you can allocate client resources</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs a fundamental mistake to assume that as a consultant we can allocate client resources. We typically don‚Äôt have a complete view of everything that the company is working on, we don‚Äôt have a detailed understanding of how long things actually take or the full range of dependencies required for them.</p>

<p>Barging into a client saying that they should do something implies a kind of confidence and bravado that can be arrogant at best and ignorant at worst.</p>

<p>Think about the last time you saw a project through from start to finish - the range of complexities, dependencies, hurdles, different work streams and so on required to get it over the finish line are almost certainly missing from the overly-confident and overly-simplistic ‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>The simple way that this phrase goes wrong is by under-estimating the <strong>resource complexity</strong> of a task:</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: working with a client where I wanted to re-design a landing page on their site to improve it. Unfortunately I was under-estimating the number of people who need to be involved since the landing pages were still owned by the product team and are technically part of the same codebase as the full tech product. So a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù change required detailed security scrutiny and QA before going live. Making ‚Äúsimple‚Äù changes was not in fact simple at all here.</p>
</div>

<p>But there‚Äôs also under-estimating the <strong>political complexity</strong> of the task:</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: working with the NYTimes cooking team I suggested that they should re-tag their content. This kind of ‚Äúyou should‚Ä¶‚Äù recommendation seemed straightforward but neglected the political considerations - the team had just spent 6-figures on re-tagging all their recipes - so to ask for further budget to re-do a task they had just done would lose them face internally. A ‚Äústraightforward‚Äù change that actually carried a bunch of political baggage.</p>
</div>

<p>Some other types of complexity that you might be under-estimating with regards resource allocation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Regulation/compliance complexity</strong> - which either prevents you even doing your recommendation or makes it slower.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical complexity</strong> - while something might be technically easy, doing it with the client‚Äôs existing technology might be hard.</li>
  <li><strong>Data complexity</strong> - a simple seeming request on the surface (make a landing page for every neighborhood) might actually depend on a robust, maintained data set that doesn‚Äôt yet exist.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance complexity</strong> - even if the initial request to create something or do something is not resource intensive, it might come with an implicit agreement to continue to maintain it - expanding the resources allocated.</li>
  <li><strong>Production complexity</strong> - where what you‚Äôre proposing isn‚Äôt that expensive or resource intensive to do, but the client (for whatever reason) has a higher quality threshold, making the recommendation more expensive/slower/harder than you anticipated.</li>
  <li><strong>Narrative complexity</strong> - where what you‚Äôre recommending seems reasonable but either the company has tried it before, or a competitor has tried it before or there‚Äôs a general sense that ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù. Which can make your recommendation extremely hard to actually get done.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-you-should-is-too-prescriptive-in-form">2. ‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù is too prescriptive in form</h3>

<p>In addition to under-estimating the problem, we also over-fit the solution. After all, as we saw in the chapter <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/">The Consultant‚Äôs Grain</a>, as independent consultants we often bias towards our own natural strengths and areas of expertise.</p>

<p>When we say <em>‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> we‚Äôre essentially offering a problem diagnosis AND a solution at the same time. The consequence of this is that we‚Äôre essentially asking the client to accept or reject both together.</p>

<p>Instead, most of your work would be more effective at actually changing clients if you stopped to clearly separate the diagnosis from the solution. If you don‚Äôt properly win over all the necessary stakeholders at the client‚Äôs side you‚Äôre going to face resistance trying to get anything done.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: I was working with Gartner Digital Markets on some SEO strategy and I felt that we needed to work on some more transformative work than simple technical SEO fixes - their core landing pages were offering a worse user experience than the competition and we were losing ground.</p>

  <p>Persuading the rest of the organization that this was a problem wasn‚Äôt straightforward. We‚Äôd been saying that these pages needed overhauling and it felt like no one was listening. So we ran a small user survey to ask a series of 10 ‚ÄúGoogle quality rater questions‚Äù. This allowed us to present our findings to the senior leadership team at Gartner and I remember showing something like this:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/2024-01-19-16-04-03.png" alt="" /></p>

  <p>Instantly, people leaned in around the table and there was a lot of executive interest. Saying something like ‚Äúwe should improve our pages‚Äù is too bland and generic - it only serves to win over people who already agree with you. It lacks any kind of rigor or weight to win someone over who already has their own opinions and roadmap.</p>

  <p>In this situation - the survey allowed us to <em>quantify</em> the problem correctly and provided compelling evidence, we didn‚Äôt even need to offer a solution! Articulating the problem was enough to convince the necessary teams to take action and prioritize work.</p>
</div>

<p>So if you‚Äôre asking <em>‚ÄúYou should‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> to the client, stop and examine if you‚Äôve properly defined the situation and provided evidence for the problem, to help the client deeply internalize the problem and win over the necessary stakeholders before you propose any kind of solution.</p>

<p>A good mental exercise to ensure you‚Äôre doing the work here is to ask yourself: what happens if the client takes no action? What is the consequence of the current trajectory, or the null case of no investment? This will help you bring some rigor to the question of what the consequence of the problem truly is and allow the problem to be quantified relative to other projects and investment opportunities.</p>

<p>So, what‚Äôs the alternative?</p>

<h2 id="there-is-an-opportunity-to">‚ÄúThere is an opportunity to‚Ä¶‚Äù</h2>

<p>This phrase is the key - it places the focus correctly on first defining the problem - and then providing evidence - before focusing on the solution. It allows us to articulate and quantify the opportunity while leaving room for the client to have say over resource allocation, for the client to shape the solution and for the client to determine prioritization and timing.</p>

<p>Of course in reality, you‚Äôre often involved in shaping the solution too - but it‚Äôs crucial to ensure that you‚Äôre not skipping over the step of clearly defining the size and shape of the opportunity before getting to the solution.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: Working with an ecommerce site to define an SEO strategy part of my recommendation involved investing in content strategy to drive links, traffic and conversions - but before even getting into the shape of the solution, i.e. <em>how</em> we would invest in content it‚Äôs important to articulate what the opportunity is.</p>

  <p>By looking at relevant competitors we can estimate the potential traffic and revenue opportunity:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/advice-quantified.png" alt="" /></p>

  <p>By showing what‚Äôs possible, clients are able to feel more invested in designing the solution with you, rather than just being told what to do.</p>
</div>

<p>This can also be uncomfortable! There are many situations where quantifying the exact opportunity is difficult, requires estimation or requires a different approach (like we saw with the Gartner surveys).</p>

<p>But consider the alternative - the alternative is recommending something to the client‚Ä¶ because we say so?</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt necessarily wrong - there‚Äôs value in expert opinion - but in my experience clients deeply appreciate you clearly separating out expert opinion and judgment from evidence-based analysis.</p>

<p>As David Maister says in the Trusted Advisor - the best approach is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good process for the advisor to follow is:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Give them their options</li>
    <li>Give them an education about their options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth)</li>
    <li>Give them a recommendation</li>
    <li>Let them choose</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>This stance essentially allows you as the consultant to own the diagnosis and quantification of the opportunity and then collaboratively with the client to shape the solution and prioritization.</p>

<h2 id="lets-look-at-the-problem-together">Let‚Äôs look at the problem together</h2>

<p>Taking a collaborative stance with your client is powerful. There are many aspects of consulting that are almost combative by nature - like pointing out problems the client has (that the client was complicit in creating!).</p>

<p>As we saw in the chapter <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Optimism as an Operating System</a>, walking into a client with a critical eye can create a distance between you and the client.</p>

<p>Instead you want to create a kind of shoulder-to-shoulder stance with the client, facing towards the problems together. This creates a much safer, judgment free way to look at the problems (and opportunities) facing the client.</p>

<p>In fact, for senior executives - sometimes you really <em>can‚Äôt</em> give them advice - they‚Äôre too type-A and overly confident. The only way to convince them is to help them see the problem in a new light - to see things as you see them.</p>

<p>This idea is demonstrated beautifully by Timothy Gallway in The Inner Game of Tennis where he recounts teaching a senior executive how to improve their backhand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day in the summer of 1971 when I was teaching a group of men at John Gardiner‚Äôs Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, a businessman realized how much more power and control he got on his backhand when his racket was taken back below the level of the ball. He was so enthusiastic about his ‚Äúnew‚Äù stroke that he rushed to tell his friend Jack about it as if some kind of miracle had occurred. Jack, who considered his erratic backhand one of the major problems of his life, came rushing up to me during the lunch hour, exclaiming, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had a terrible backhand. Maybe you can help me.‚Äù</p>

  <p>I asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so terrible about your backhand?‚Äù</p>

  <p>‚ÄúI take my racket back too high on my backswing.‚Äù</p>

  <p>‚ÄúHow do you know?‚Äù</p>

  <p>‚ÄúBecause at least five different pros have told me so. I just haven‚Äôt been able to correct it.‚Äù</p>

  <p>For a brief moment I was aware of the absurdity of the situation. Here was a business executive who controlled large commercial enterprises of great complexity asking me for help as if he had no control over his own right arm. Why wouldn‚Äôt it be possible, I wondered, to give him the simple reply, ‚ÄúSure, I can help you. L-o-w-e-r y-o-u-r r-a-c-k-e-t!‚Äù</p>

  <p>But complaints such as Jack‚Äôs are common among people of all levels of intelligence and proficiency. Besides, it was clear that at least five other pros had told him to lower his racket without much effect. What was keeping him from doing it? I wondered.</p>

  <p>I asked Jack to take a few swings on the patio where we were standing. His backswing started back very low, but then, sure enough, just before swinging forward it lifted to the level of his shoulder and swung down into the imagined ball. The five pros were right. I asked him to swing several more times without making any comment. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that better?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI tried to keep it low.‚Äù But each time just before swinging forward, his racket lifted; it was obvious that had he been hitting an actual ball, the underspin imparted by the downward swing would have caused it to sail out. ‚ÄúYour backhand is all right,‚Äù I said reassuringly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going through some changes. Why don‚Äôt you take a closer look at it.‚Äù We walked over to a large windowpane and there I asked him to swing again while watching his reflection. He did so, again taking his characteristic hitch at the back of his swing, but this time he was astounded. ‚ÄúHey, I really do take my racket back high! It goes up above my shoulder!‚Äù There was no judgment in his voice; he was just reporting with amazement what his eyes had seen.</p>

  <p>What surprised me was Jack‚Äôs surprise. Hadn‚Äôt he said that five pros had told him his racket was too high? I was certain that if I had told him the same thing after his first swing, he would have replied, ‚ÄúYes, I know.‚Äù But what was now clear was that he didn‚Äôt really know, since no one is ever surprised at seeing something they already know. Despite all those lessons, he had never directly experienced his racket going back high. His mind had been so absorbed in the process of judgment and trying to change this ‚Äúbad‚Äù stroke that he had never perceived the stroke itself.</p>

  <p>Looking in the glass which mirrored his stroke as it was, Jack was able to keep his racket low quite effortlessly as he swung again. ‚ÄúThat feels entirely different than any backhand I‚Äôve ever swung,‚Äù he declared. By now he was swinging up and through the ball over and over again. Interestingly, he wasn‚Äôt congratulating himself for doing it right; he was simply absorbed in how different it felt.</p>

  <p>After lunch I threw Jack a few balls and he was able to remember how the stroke felt and to repeat the action. This time he just felt where his racket was going, letting his sense of feel replace the visual image offered by the mirror. It was a new experience for him. Soon he was consistently hitting topspin backhands into the court with an effortlessness that made it appear this was his natural swing. In ten minutes he was feeling ‚Äúin the groove,‚Äù and he paused to express his gratitude. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate what you‚Äôve done for me. I‚Äôve learned more in ten minutes from you than in twenty hours of lessons I‚Äôve taken on my backhand.‚Äù I could feel something inside me begin to puff up as it absorbed these ‚Äúgood‚Äù words. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt know quite how to handle this lavish compliment, and found myself hemming and hawing, trying to come up with an appropriately modest reply. Then, for a moment, my mind turned off and I realized that I hadn‚Äôt given Jack a single instruction on his backhand! ‚ÄúBut what did I teach you?‚Äù I asked. He was quiet for a full half-minute, trying to remember what I had told him. Finally he said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember your telling me anything! You were just there watching, and you got me watching myself closer than I ever had before. Instead of seeing what was wrong with my backhand, I just started observing, and improvement seemed to happen on its own. I‚Äôm not sure why, but I certainly learned a lot in a short period of time.‚Äù He had learned, but had he been ‚Äútaught‚Äù?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is about tennis (is it?) but equally applies to consulting! I find in my own work that senior executives are often blocked by some inability to see what‚Äôs actually going on - and that telling them is useless! Instead you need to help them see it for themselves.</p>

<p>Because of their distance from the day to day work, senior executives are especially prone to replacing some version of reality with a compressed narrative. And when this compressed narrative is wrong in some key way you need to return to first principles to show them (not tell them!).</p>

<p>Much like we saw with the example of the Gartner surveys - helping clients see with fresh eyes what‚Äôs really going is powerful and can be profoundly useful before you even begin suggesting solutions.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-problem-in-all-of-its-emotional-and-political-complexity">Understanding the problem in all of its emotional and political complexity</h2>

<p>Once you adopt this collaborative stance with the client you begin to see that the problems as you thought you understood them, are not in fact the full picture.</p>

<p>Your sense of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on‚Äù with a client is intermediated by your point of contact and it turns out that your client is an unreliable narrator. Remember - best case they have problems they‚Äôve been unable to solve on their own, worst case they were actively responsible for creating the problems in the first place!</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs no wonder that clients often down-play, mis-represent and mask the full emotional and political complexity of what‚Äôs going on. Especially when you first start working together and haven‚Äôt yet earned their trust.</p>

<p>But for you to do your job it‚Äôs crucial that you get a full picture of what‚Äôs really going on. And further, clients deeply appreciate a consultant that can listen and observe closely enough to see what‚Äôs really going on.</p>

<p>As David Maister says in <a href="https://davidmaister.com/articles/the-consultants-role/">The Consultant‚Äôs Role</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIt can be unsettling to find that the client is primarily interested in having his or her problem understood, in all its emotional and political complexity, as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this is saying is that you need to earn the client‚Äôs trust in order to be effective at your job. This isn‚Äôt at all obvious! When a client comes to you asking for a ‚Äúcontent strategy‚Äù or support ‚Äúhiring a VP marketing‚Äù it all seems so straightforward, rational and well defined. But as you unpack the layers of the onion you begin to realize why it‚Äôs been so hard for the client to help themselves. And that‚Äôs when the emotional and political complexity of the problem starts to come into view.</p>

<p>Developing a sensitivity to the emotional and political context of client problems requires an active listening and sensing instinct on behalf of the consultant - to use your own lived experience inside the client‚Äôs organization as a way to sense what the inner work life is like inside your client‚Äôs business. As Ruth Orenstein says in her book <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Multidimensional_Executive_Coaching/FVHnN1-O-rQC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0">Multidimensional Executive Coaching</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the time he/she is present, the consultant becomes part of the multidimensional system, both influencing it and being influenced by it. To do the work of executive coach- ing, then, the consultant must be able to tolerate, and ultimately make use of, entering a highly complex place-a place that is occupied by neither the individual nor the organization alone but, because of their convergence, both the individual and the organization together; a place that contains both the exigencies of working life and the impulses of the psyche; and a place that engages and, in turn, is engaged by the consultant‚Äôs own intrapsychic material. In addition, if the work is done effectively, it requires that the consultant be both involved enough in the dynamics so as to experience their impact and detached enough so as to analyze what is transpiring. These demands make imperative the use of oneself as tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember: when clients first come to you, your first instinct might be to dismiss the problem as ‚Äúeasily solved‚Äù. But you need to hold space to truly consider that the thing that seems easy is, in this particular situation, with this particular client actually not at all easy. And that‚Äôs when the work begins.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-most-useful-thing">The Next Most Useful Thing</h2>

<p>This all builds up to my personal consulting mantra: always work on the next most useful thing.</p>

<p>This mantra helps remind me that consulting isn‚Äôt about being right, it‚Äôs about being useful.</p>

<p>As a consultant - it‚Äôs crucial that you‚Äôre generating momentum, that clients can <em>feel a sense of progress in your work</em>. A consultant is typically an expensive investment and without a sense of progress or momentum your engagement will stall out.</p>

<p>Importantly however, a sense of progress and momentum doesn‚Äôt have to come from the official SOW or project plan. Actual progress is one thing - but a <em>sense of progress</em> is just that - it‚Äôs about your client feeling like things are moving forward.</p>

<p>In fact, depending on the project and the client - moving at the expected pace can be too slow! Even after agreeing on a scope, project plan and set of next steps, moving as fast as you said you would can be disappointing to the client.</p>

<p>Remember - building a great client relationship is about trust. And doing the minimum doesn‚Äôt build trust. So it‚Äôs important to demonstrate to the client that you‚Äôre willing to do the extra work, to go a little further, to do the unexpected.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt require a ton of extra time but it does require some deliberate effort and sensitivity - to think about the client‚Äôs reality - the meetings, projects, pressures they‚Äôre facing right now - and think about how you can proactively support them.</p>

<p>You could re-draw the diagram from up above as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/advice-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whether your client is facing an important decision, or preparing for a board meeting or working through a bunch of menial tasks - whatever it is there‚Äôs typically a way for you to help out in some small way. And in doing so the client feels a sense of momentum and builds a sense of trust between you.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the next most useful thing?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not about ignoring the SOW or the project plan but it‚Äôs about recognizing that there‚Äôs value in giving your client a sense of momentum.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: I worked with a B2B saas client a few years ago - they were a small startup looking to raise their series B round and we engaged to create a content strategy.</p>

  <p>On this project I made a mistake and despite the fact the client didn‚Äôt have any in-house editorial resources I took their request at face value and we structured the project around a 6-week content strategy.</p>

  <p>I delivered what I think is good quality work with a deeply researched and evidence-based 66-page strategy for producing content and‚Ä¶. Nothing happened? They were happy enough with the work product but it didn‚Äôt lead to any material change in their strategy or an ongoing consulting relationship.</p>

  <p>In hindsight the key mistake here was not asking myself enough what the next most useful thing was. I think if I‚Äôd been more honest about what would add value and show momentum for the client it would have been either a) condensed one or two slide summary of the content opportunity for their fundraising deck and/or b) supporting their VP marketing recruitment effort.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I should have done both. Either way - it turns out that what the client wanted wasn‚Äôt really what the client needed and this mismatch led to a fairly unproductive engagement.</p>
</div>

<p>Recognizing that clients are unreliable narrators when it comes to scoping projects and defining timelines allows for a more philosophical view of value when it comes to consulting.</p>

<p>Is a 6 week strategy project really the most useful thing the client needs right now? What happens at that point when we have the strategy defined - then what? By seeking more context, clarity and insight into momentum we can more easily work on things that the client will truly appreciate, not just provide things the client asked for.</p>

<h2 id="a-conclusion-about-owls">A Conclusion About Owls</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs an internet meme about giving advice that I love. It‚Äôs an image that shows you how to draw an owl:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-01-19-16-44-52.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Too much bad consulting work looks like either step 1 or step 2. Either you‚Äôre telling the client <em>‚Äúdraw some circles‚Äù</em> and the client is frustrated the advice is too basic and high level. Or you‚Äôre telling the client to <em>‚Äúdraw the rest of the fucking owl‚Äù</em> and are ignoring the detailed reality of the situation and the limitations of teams, resources and capabilities.</p>

<p>Or worse, the client asked you for help drawing owls but what they‚Äôre really doing is painting a woodland scene‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Think about this image next time a client comes to you for help drawing owls - your first response shouldn‚Äôt be <em>‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs easy, first you draw some circles‚Äù</em>, it should be <em>‚ÄúShow me how your owls look today. What do you think is holding you back from drawing better owls? And why is drawing owls important to you right now?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Remember - it‚Äôs about adopting a collaborative, trusted stance with clients. And that might require resisting your initial urge to give advice. Instead you need to listen to the full emotional and political situation and then work with the client to re-examine reality in new and surprising ways.</p>

<p>Always work on the next most useful thing. And that doesn‚Äôt always involve doing what the client asked for.</p>

        <p>I recently read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Impro-Improvisation-Theatre-Keith-Johnstone/dp/0878301178">Impro - Improvisation and the Theatre</a> by Keith Johnstone<sup id="fnref:vgr"><a href="#fn:vgr" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It‚Äôs a delightful book all about improvisational theatre and importantly <em>how to teach</em> improvisational theatre.</p>

<p>The book inspired me to draw many analogies between the improv actor and the consultant and I have written a five part series. They loosely flow in order but each can be read in any order:</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work</strong>. This post looks at the central problem of ‚Äúperforming‚Äù work and how important it is for modern knowledge work - especially for the consultant. We end with some ideas around how to think on your feet without bullshitting.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System</a></strong>. This post highlights the tendency for consultants to be critical and to see everything as a problem. We‚Äôll reframe this by showing the power of being positive - especially for long-term retainers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">Chapter 3 - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients</a></strong>. Here we think of clients as blocked actors and we take inspiration from the ‚ÄúYes! and‚Ä¶‚Äù exercise to see how we can unblock clients to generate new strategies and creative thinking with clients.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">Chapter 4 - Navigating Power &amp; Status</a></strong>. How to get things done inside organizations by understanding power potholes and status switching. We explore the concept of high status and low status and show how the consultant has to become adept at a new skill of ‚Äústatus switching‚Äù in order to be successful inside client organizations.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/08/18/the-fool/">Chapter 5 - The Contrary Consultant</a></strong>. Embracing the fool &amp; the power of not fitting in. We explore the identity of outsider and how to reconcile this with working inside client organizations.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-1---the-office-is-a-theatre-for-work">Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work</h1>

<p>Which of these do you recognize?</p>

<p><em>Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.</em></p>

<p><em>Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we‚Äôre working.</em></p>

<p><em>Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.</em></p>

<p><em>Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.</em></p>

<p><em>Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.</em></p>

<p><em>Jealousy of colleagues who don‚Äôt do good work but excel at presenting their work.</em></p>

<p><em>People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don‚Äôt.</em></p>

<p>Much of modern knowledge work is performance‚Ä¶ In fact:</p>

<p><strong>The office is a theatre,  and work is an unfolding narrative on the stage.</strong></p>

<p>Many people aspire to ‚Äúsilent success‚Äù at work - to do work that ‚Äúspeaks for itself‚Äù. Unfortunately this is the wrong move in the theatre of work. Instead we should aspire to the opposite - <strong>for knowledge work, the performance of the work <em>is</em> the work.</strong></p>

<p>Because in truth - how else could it function?</p>

<p>Much as we might like to think of organizations as rational machines - the reality is that companies are social organizations and people interacting with people is the way decisions are made and how work gets done.</p>

<p>And in this theatre of human work it‚Äôs crucial to speak up. Spending time on the performance is not wasted - in fact quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Without performance work gets sidelined, ignored or worse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Among more than 120 evaluation and program executives surveyed at private foundations the US and Canada, more than three-quarters had difficulty commissioning evaluations that result in meaningful insights for the field, their grantees, or the foundation itself, and 70% have found it challenging to incorporate evaluation results into the foundation‚Äôs future work. <strong>A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that ‚Äúsimply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn‚Äôt necessarily improve their decision-making,‚Äù with respondents indicating ‚Äúthat they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren‚Äôt rewarded when they did.‚Äù</strong> - <a href="https://medium.com/@iandavidmoss/this-is-why-your-hard-work-sits-on-the-shelf-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it-a7ca5e063038">why your hard work sits on the shelf and what to do about it</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in fact <a href="https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433">this excellent Twitter thread from Maxim</a> shows the value in caring deeply about the presentation and context of the work:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nobody ever picks the third, wacky, design direction.</p>&mdash; Maxim Leyzerovich (@round) <a href="https://twitter.com/round/status/892486242721554433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 1, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>What does the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of work look like?</p>

<p>Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Presentations of your work</li>
  <li>Hallway chats</li>
  <li>1:1 conversations to build alignment</li>
  <li>Crafting the wrapper and positioning of your work</li>
  <li>Changing the language of your work to match others</li>
  <li>Including wider contexts of the organization, the industry and the market in your work</li>
  <li>Reformatting your presentations to fit other team‚Äôs strategies</li>
  <li>and much more‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In the theatre of work the performance of work is intimately tied to the work itself.</strong></p>

<p>But many employees attempt to hide or ignore the performance of work and the politics of the organization. They imagine that this public sphere of voice and politics is wasted energy or somehow ‚Äúunfair‚Äù<sup id="fnref:unfair"><a href="#fn:unfair" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="being-present-public-and-acting-with-voice">Being present, public and acting with voice</h2>

<p>If we think of the office as a theatre for work the <em>only</em> meaningful way forward is through this sphere of politics and voice. As Venkatesh Rao from Ribbonfarm outlines in his post <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/09/14/how-to-make-history/">how to make history</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You do not appear in public through labor, let alone make history. Laboring humans are fungible as individuals, and only consequential actors with a political voice en masse</strong> (whether organized in egalitarian ways as a working class or non-egalitarian ways as a patriarchy, or ethno-nationalist clientelistic identity group). [‚Ä¶]</p>

  <p><strong>If labor is about blending into the processes of nature, and making about interrupting and slowing it to create a durable world, action is about free behaviors that make history.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ideas of ‚Äúbeing public‚Äù and ‚Äúexercising voice‚Äù both have relatively specific meanings in the Hannah Arendt sense and I‚Äôd encourage you to spend time reading here if you‚Äôre not familiar<sup id="fnref:arendt"><a href="#fn:arendt" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here are two examples that might help explain opportunities for being public and having voice:</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example #1: choosing to take a position on something that situates <strong>you</strong> in the company‚Äôs world. A great example of this is <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611">Steve Yegge‚Äôs platform rant</a>. Note how closely Steve is situated in the narrative here - it‚Äôs not simply an observation of the market but of taking a position on the world that situates Google, Amazon and Steve. This can feel daunting but ask yourself the last time you showed up in Slack to post something that has voice? To say something about the organization‚Ä¶</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example #2: asking questions in public forums (all-hands, quarterly business updates etc). These are opportunities where executives are inviting public voice - they‚Äôre asking for people to take positions and have opinions.</p>
</div>

<p>Of course there are an infinite number of other situations where voice and being public are possible<sup id="fnref:speech"><a href="#fn:speech" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>‚Ä¶ but most employees would rather shy away from these instead of embracing them as part of the work.</p>

<p>Orchestrating performances for your work is the key to more influence and more impact.</p>

<h2 id="enter-stage-left-the-consultant">Enter Stage Left: The Consultant</h2>

<p>Ah, but so far what we‚Äôre describing is the reality of the working world. Now let‚Äôs situate the consultant in the theatre of work.</p>

<p>The luxury that full time employees gain is the ability to script and rehearse their performances - to plan ahead. The consultant is like an improv actor thrust into a play mid-performance, forced to find ways to fit in, go with the flow and steer the performance all while <em>on stage</em>.</p>

<p>For example - full time employees get the luxury of being involved in 2020 planning. <strong>Consultants are an outcome of 2020 planning</strong> and so get brought in mid-performance to course correct.</p>

<p>Consultants that attempt to halt the performance cause pain and typically don‚Äôt stick around. Instead consultants that accept and embrace their nature as improv actors thrive and become integrated into the great performance of the organization.</p>

<h2 id="the-theatre-of-work-is-an-improv-theatre">The Theatre of Work is an Improv Theatre</h2>

<p>As a consultant, attempting to tightly script and design the performance of the work will inevitably lead to <strong>missed timings, missed context or missed feedback</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Missed timings</strong> - As a consultant you‚Äôre often working less than 5-days a week with a client. So you‚Äôre slower than full-time employees. This means if you try and slow down to polish the performance of your work you can miss the window of opportunity. So the improv consultant must learn to un-polish, prototype and improvise in real-time just to keep up with the client‚Äôs organization.</p>

<p><strong>Missed context</strong> - Because you‚Äôre not a full-time employee (even if you‚Äôre working 5 days a week) you may not be included on all-hands emails, announcements and so on and so you always have to work hard to gain the full context of a client. <strong>Tightly scripting a performance doesn‚Äôt leave room for new contexts to emerge during the performance</strong>. Instead there should always be room for new context to emerge and get integrated into the performance in real-time.</p>

<p><strong>Missed feedback</strong> - <strong>It‚Äôs not uncommon as a consultant to be the most proficient powerpoint user in the org</strong> (or at least your portion of the org). This has benefits but it also has the unintended consequence of making everything you touch look ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. And finished work gets very different feedback from people than raw materials and thinking. So sometimes it‚Äôs important to un-design and un-polish your work, to invite people onto the stage to co-create the performance - this way you ensure that you get the appropriate feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Good consultants think of performances more like an unfolding series of improv sessions.</strong></p>

<p>Many organizations at the executive level already function like tight improv groups - reacting to implicit and explicit cues and playing off each other to make in-the-moment decisions.</p>

<p>As a consultant - this executive level improv troupe is where the real work gets done and where you‚Äôre aiming for. It‚Äôs the essence of why Venkatesh‚Äôs idea of client ‚Äúsparring‚Äù<sup id="fnref:sparring"><a href="#fn:sparring" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> is so appealing - because it embraces this verbal improv decision making that everyone recognizes.</p>

<p>So how does this idea of improv begin to shape our thinking? Some obvious ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need to be present in the room. Where the performance of the work <em>is</em> the work we can‚Äôt leave the presentation and narrative of the work to others.</li>
  <li>Study the people as much as you study the organization. When you‚Äôre reacting to work mid-performance half of what you‚Äôre reacting to is the strategy and half of it is the set of relationships and biases of the people in the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>And one non-obvious idea:</p>

<h2 id="the-serendipity-deficit-of-consultants--manufacturing-improv-sessions">The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants &amp; Manufacturing Improv Sessions</h2>

<p>A failure mode for employees is striving for work to happen in the official channels - to wait for the meeting to talk about the strategy, to wait for the email chain to pitch in. This desire to make work ‚Äúofficial‚Äù means many employees are uncomfortable talking about their work on the way to the coffee shop or in the hallway between meetings.</p>

<p>But it‚Äôs exactly these free-form sessions when executives drop their guard, open up and the possibility to operate in a liminal space between contexts is possible.</p>

<p><strong>And the most important thing to understand about these ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù improv sessions is that they are most useful for laying the first seed of an idea. Good ideas don‚Äôt instantly make an impact and if you want executives to pay attention you have to make sure they hear the idea several times. So drop it first in the hallway before formalizing it in a meeting.</strong></p>

<p>Of course I say ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù because actually humans are remarkably predictable and it‚Äôs often trivial to engineer these serendipitous hallway conversations. And you <em>should</em> be manufacturing them.</p>

<p>Remember - if you‚Äôre a consultant in a client‚Äôs office two days a week you‚Äôre operating at a serendipity-deficit. You simply have less surface area to bump into people. So you have to cheat.</p>

<p>A fellow consultant friend brought up the idea of getting into the office early to deliberately catch the CEO on the way in the door before they settled into focus mode. To intercept them intentionally to create a small improv session. To lay the first seeds for ideas.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-think-on-your-feet-without-bullshitting">How to think on your feet without bullshitting</h2>

<p>Above all else however, you need to embrace a level of ‚Äúthinking on your feet‚Äù - it‚Äôs essential to the consultant‚Äôs work and a consequence of being brought in mid-performance.</p>

<p>This ‚Äúthinking on your feet‚Äù is about the balance between deflecting decisions for further analysis and providing the answer there and then.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: one of the most visible ways this manifests is the first day or week with a new client. Executives love to probe you with ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù questions - learning to provide an answer that you believe in but leaves room for revision later is key. The real game that‚Äôs being played here is not one of being right or wrong - it‚Äôs the executive asking two questions at once - firstly ‚Äúhow much do you know?‚Äù and secondly ‚Äúcan you improv?‚Äù to understand how useful you‚Äôre going to be in the theatre of work.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Unfortunately -  in the theatre of work there‚Äôs a fine line between thinking on your feet and bullshitting‚Ä¶</strong></p>

<p>Who‚Äôs been in a meeting and been disgusted with people spouting things that are half-true, made-up or masks over the real truth?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a fine line between reacting to a situation in the room and bullshitting.</p>

<p>As a consultant this is especially hard to avoid. Your default mode of operating is the liminal space between industries, businesses and markets. A few times a year I‚Äôm forced to learn something new from scratch. This forces us to work in spaces where we‚Äôre often the <em>least</em> knowledgeable about a specific business (even if we are <em>experts</em> in the industry‚Ä¶ And sometimes we‚Äôre <em>experts</em> at a discipline but neither knowledgeable about the <em>business</em> or the <em>industry</em>).</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs a little guide to avoiding bullshit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Immerse yourself in the core business mechanics, you should be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue &amp; profit function reasonably well. The more abstraction here the more you risk a fundamental mis-understanding and straying into BS.</li>
  <li>Become a language chameleon - study and adopt the language,  acronyms and buzzwords of the client‚Äôs business. If they call it ‚Äúearned marketing‚Äù you should too. If their CMS is called PinkCloud you call it that too. Specificity allows you to avoid confusion and helps you distinguish between the client‚Äôs CMS and the market‚Äôs CMS (for example).</li>
  <li>Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification on points that don‚Äôt seem to make sense. No pretending. Don‚Äôt adopt the language too quickly! (ha, see how hard this is?)</li>
  <li>Ask stupid questions. Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas. Just because people at the client choose not to talk about obvious things doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt.</li>
  <li>Defend your ideas but not your points. Be willing to defend your ideas even if some data points get challenged. It‚Äôs very common that the number or stat you‚Äôre using to support your point will be wrong but that the broader idea still holds. Don‚Äôt concede the idea but also don‚Äôt try and put muscle behind the numbers - accept they‚Äôre wrong but keep pressing on the idea to see where you get.</li>
  <li>When you get challenged pull out some counter-factuals - when someone is claiming that your data is wrong challenge them with proving the opposite.</li>
  <li>Keep your eye on the prize for business outcomes, not intellectual debates. Executives are fond of theorizing and debating ideas that stray into the get into the abstract - you can play this game a little but try to be the one to ground conversations in reality.</li>
  <li>Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Don‚Äôt be afraid to source things from different industries. This is the kind of cross-industry vantage point that clients find hard to get internally.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all ways to avoid bullshitting - but unfortunately there‚Äôs one simple way to avoid bullshit - by being critical.</p>

<p><strong>It‚Äôs far easier to retreat to the critical, negative position and say why things won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt work. Except‚Ä¶ this is a mistake.</strong></p>

<p>Being positive and optimistic is far harder but more effective. And we‚Äôre going to talk about that in the next post‚Ä¶. <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Optimism as an Operating System</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticize the client you‚Äôll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This is part 2 in a 5-part series called Yes! And‚Ä¶ - exploring the relationship between the theatre of work, the consultant as improv actor and the generative positivity of Yes! And‚Ä¶ <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/">Catch up on chapter 1 here</a>.</em></p>

<p>The consultant thrives on problems. Things to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, ‚Äúsolved‚Äù and ‚Äúimproved‚Äù. As a result it can be natural to take pleasure in identifying problems. That smell of a fresh client - waiting to be carved up by sharp 2x2s. A client with problems is a <em>good client</em> for a consultant.</p>

<p>And yet‚Ä¶</p>

<p>If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you‚Äôll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.</p>

<p>Instead it‚Äôs crucial to ignore that gleeful feeling that comes from recognizing problems and force yourself to identify the systems that <em>are</em> working - to embrace the <em>strengths</em> of an organization first.</p>

<p>Remember - <strong>consulting is humans all the way down</strong> - no client wants to bring in a negative, critical or attacking consultant. And no team wants to listen to a consultant that <em>‚Äúhas a better way of doing things‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>The sweet-spot (especially in the first few months of an engagement) is identifying the existing flows, biases and strengths of a client so that you can move with them, not against them. Go with the grain<sup id="fnref:twenty"><a href="#fn:twenty" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Why is this so important? Because if you want to work with an organization for a long time and make a difference, <strong>people need to like having you around</strong>. Sure, you need to be effective but I‚Äôd contend equally, if not more important, is to be a <strong>pleasure to work with</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-critical-path">The Critical Path</h2>

<p>Here are some of the problems you might face if you take an overly critical or negative eye:</p>

<p><em>Diagnosing problems without solutions - causing the organization to slow down.</em></p>

<p><em>Short term engagements that feel productive but don‚Äôt last.</em></p>

<p><em>Culture clash problems with team members at the client‚Äôs organization.</em></p>

<p><em>Creating strategy that sounds good but fails to get implemented.</em></p>

<p><em>Exhausting clients and client teams with a feeling of urgency and crisis.</em></p>

<p>It can be tempting in particular to treat the work you‚Äôre doing with a client as <em>critical</em>. It‚Äôs helpful to think this way because it inflates the ego and helps you charge well.</p>

<p>But the truth is that if you‚Äôre designing for retained work (and you should be) then you will exhaust the teams you‚Äôre working with and challenge the status of the executive team. <strong>No client wants to be in long-term crisis</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead - while it may seem counterintuitive the right answer is to <strong>downplay the importance of your work</strong>. To place the work within a context of comfort. The strongest language you have as a consultant is:</p>

<p><em>‚Äúthis is a solvable problem‚Äù</em></p>

<p>The most successful projects are those where you can build routine solutions to important problems.</p>

<p>This provides a sense to the client of competence, of bringing calm to otherwise high-pressure situations and of reminding them that this may take a while to solve!</p>

<h2 id="back-stage-in-the-theatre-of-work">Back-stage in the Theatre of Work</h2>

<p>It can be tempting as a consultant to keep a serious mask on at all times. You might be getting paid an hourly rate that certainly makes you feel all serious and grown up‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>And yet - it‚Äôs humans all the way down and if you want to be effective in the theatre of work you need to recognize and participate in both the front-stage and back-stage environments of a client‚Äôs office.</strong></p>

<p>Front-stage is loosely defined as ‚Äúmore professional contexts‚Äù i.e. meetings, conversations about work directly etc. The Back-stage is loosely defined as ‚Äúless professional contexts‚Äù i.e. the kitchen, breakroom, etc.</p>

<p>It can be tempting as a consultant to avoid the back-stage area. Crude humor and letting off steam is a dangerous place for an outsider - and yet if you don‚Äôt engage you risk becoming ‚Äúthe outsider‚Äù yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Embedded in, arising from and flowing through many of the routines and rituals of professional life, the stream of humour is one of its most distinctive features, providing not only a source of enrichment and nourishment but also serving as <strong>a defining characteristic of the territory as represented by its inhabitants</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, just because the back-stage is less formal than the front-stage it‚Äôs no less important for real work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the characteristics of the back region make possible a creative redefinition of professional experience that is achieved through humour and stories. Talking about professional encounters is the stuff of the back region, <strong>but it would be a mistake to assume that such talk is trivial simply because of the context in which it occurs: serious business does not necessarily have to be done seriously</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of these quotes come from the book <a href="https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781403938008">Language and Professional Identity</a> which is a gem and worth consuming entirely if the study of language interests you<sup id="fnref:language"><a href="#fn:language" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Combined with my own experience I‚Äôll highlight some ways to think about the back-stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Show up in the back-stage of the theatre some-times but not all times. It‚Äôs important to give teams the opportunity to retain their identity and you shouldn‚Äôt overwhelm them.</li>
  <li>Join the humor and crack jokes but keep them middle road - don‚Äôt stretch to the edgy humor even if others are, politely decline to be outlandish.</li>
  <li>Be incredibly careful with aiming your jokes at any part of the organization - you never know which team or function may become an important part of your work next.</li>
  <li>Listen carefully to where humor spills over into showing people‚Äôs real frustration and bias with teams, work, executives and organizations. Humor is a strong signal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="positivity--long-term-retainers">Positivity &amp; Long Term Retainers</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a fun anecdote - I once worked with a client for a long time, in their office every week. After a while I was growing disappointed that I had not had much impact - that I‚Äôd not ‚Äúgotten much done‚Äù. When in fact it came to light that the primary reason I was there was to be excited, positive and enthusiastic. The client was trying to do a ‚Äúnew thing‚Äù and they recognized that this was hard.</p>

<p>Instead they valued the energy, enthusiasm and visibility I was giving to the problem. <strong>At times I felt like a puppy consultant - running around the office being excited about things</strong>.</p>

<p>This engagement helped me realize that there is a value to positivity - that bringing energy and enthusiasm to an organization is worth something, entirely independent of the results and outcomes you‚Äôre working on!</p>

<p><strong>Although clients will rarely pay for it directly there is value in changing the energy and changing the conversation in an organization. These are precursors to real change</strong>. And if you provide this level of positivity and optimism then clients will keep you around irrespective of your ‚Äúimpact‚Äù.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to quantify but I believe this default optimism has helped me stick around for long-term retainers with clients time and time again.</p>

<p>So, how do you retain this positive attitude in the face of clients not embracing your changes, resisting new things and generally moving slower than you‚Äôd like?</p>

<h2 id="on-client-frustration-and-the-word-just">On client frustration and the word ‚Äújust‚Ä¶‚Äù</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs important to understand that there is no ‚Äújust‚Ä¶‚Äù in the consultant‚Äôs vocabulary.</p>

<p>Every business is a balanced system - their strengths and successes are not <strong>despite</strong> their flaws but <strong>because</strong> of their flaws.</p>

<p>I love this quote: <em>‚Äúa problem is a point between two complex systems‚Äù</em><sup id="fnref:systems"><a href="#fn:systems" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So, to reframe our initial statement about problems - <strong>the key when engaging clients is not to hunt for problems but to hunt for systems</strong>.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to learn this - that strengths and weaknesses are not in opposition to each other but rather they are in symbiosis.</p>

<p>Ah - so tread carefully young consultant. The levers you want to pull are all connected.</p>

<p>This is why the initial glee at a client full of ‚Äúproblems‚Äù quickly turns to frustration - because it turns out that those initial ‚Äúproblems‚Äù were just the other side of the coin for the client‚Äôs strengths.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: I have a client I‚Äôve been working with for three years. We have a running joke that every time they engage a new SEO consultant the advice they get is ‚Äúmake the content quality better!‚Äù. The client manages multiple websites each with 20,000 URLs and has a huge team producing and improving content every day. True - content quality has not always been in their DNA but their current approach **works**. It took me a while to understand the client and in truth this only set in once I really deeply internalized the link between content quality and content quantity. There is no ‚Äújust‚Äù improving content quality without impacting their content quantity - and this is deeply tied to their internal culture, so you can't change that without impacting their company culture... See how deep these rabbit holes can go?</code></p>

<p>Dealing with this requires understanding clients as ecosystems in balance - and swallowing our initial reaction to point out easy solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Remember what is easy in one context is next to impossible in another - the theoretically possible can easily be practically impossible when you factor in resources, culture, team dynamics or market dynamics.</strong></p>

<p>So before we leap to the ‚Äújust‚Ä¶‚Äù solution we need to listen carefully and deeply understand the client‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>And this requires a positive outlook! Because anything that‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù is in fact a symptom of a strength. And only once you can see the threads that tie these together can you start to understand how to fix the problems while maintaining the strengths.</p>

<h2 id="enduring-clients">Enduring Clients</h2>

<p>I saw an internal McKinsey manual on ‚ÄúThe Art of being an Engagement Manager‚Äù that has this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Become a friend. This is the true apex of building an enduring client relationship. We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too</strong>. Building enduring relationships is not only based on delivering from a business aspect but also delivering from a personal aspect. Ask about the client‚Äôs family or interests outside of work. Tell them about your life, your hobbies, or your worries. Be accessible to your client to talk about everything from their career goals to difficulties with their team members. Some clients draw the line at different places, so don‚Äôt push‚Ä¶let it happen naturally. Once you feel the client trusts you as he does a friend, you have built a relationship that will likely be a lasting one. After the friendship is formed, like any relationship, it is crucial to follow up regularly and maintain through phone calls, e-mails, and visits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm going to re-focus on the key quote here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to create your own philosophy and tolerance for this blurring of the boundaries between ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù relationships but:</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôd argue that the personal/professional boundary is inherently compromised as a consultant.</strong></p>

<p>We can masquerade behind an LLC and company brand but consider just a few of the ways that you can blur the lines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hanging out with friends (coffee, dinner etc) can lead to talking about business and sharing work, leads and contacts</li>
  <li>When you have friends in adjacent or close industries, friends can be your biggest sources of revenue</li>
  <li>Clients at one company can leave and then hire you at their next job</li>
  <li>During a client engagement you hire your friends to support a project</li>
</ul>

<p>For me - this blurring of the boundaries has helped me most often in two specific ways</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone at a client‚Äôs office (sometimes the point of contact, sometimes just someone you worked with) leaves the company and hires you at their new job</li>
  <li>A consulting engagement that shifts from being organization focused to individual focused, and shifts from consulting to coaching.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Because this is what happens when you help clients succeed as people, not just as organizations.</strong></p>

<p>So next time you‚Äôre starting a client project think about how to default to optimism as an operating system.</p>

<p>In this chapter we‚Äôve focused a lot still on the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù of the work - on the language, people interactions and emotions of getting work done. Is that all there is? How can we use this default positivity to open clients up to more creative generative strategy?</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">Generating & Co-Creating Strategy in the Theatre of Work</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This post is part 3 of the Yes! And‚Ä¶ series. Catch up on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/">Chapter 1</a> and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Chapter 2</a></em>.</p>

<p>Good strategy sessions, like good improv sessions, are a product of multiple actors working together to build scenes collaboratively. Typically, however, we spend more time thinking about how to craft good strategies than we do thinking about how to create productive strategy sparring sessions.</p>

<p>This reflects a core misunderstanding of what strategy is.</p>

<p>Strategy is not a single point in time powerpoint deck. Good strategy is an unfolding network of associations throughout an organization. And the unit of progress for the consultant is often the sparring session with the client.</p>

<p>As I reflect back on the most effective consulting engagements I‚Äôve worked on it‚Äôs the ones where I was able to build a strong improv reflex with my client and where we had arrived at a <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> mindset between us - enabling us to co-create strategy with little regard for ego.</p>

<p>But to get there requires deliberate work to unblock clients, in fact to realize that often the consultant is the one blocking the client! (I‚Äôve certainly been guilty of this.)</p>

<p>And the output? Usually the most ordinary of strategies that simply make deliberate movement towards important new capacities.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with the most basic improv technique of them all‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="use-yes-and-to-stop-yourself-blocking-clients">Use ‚ÄúYes! And‚Ä¶‚Äù to stop yourself blocking clients</h2>

<p>The first and most basic tool you learn in improv acting is the <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> exercise - it helps actors be more creative and flow better through the process of opening up, not closing down.</p>

<p>The principle is simple and hinges on accepting your partner‚Äôs ideas and building on top of them instead of closing them down. ‚ÄúYes! And‚Ä¶‚Äù is the simple phrase to remember but not every sentence has to literally start that way.</p>

<p>This concept is deeply ingrained in my consulting work.</p>

<p>When working with clients there‚Äôs a tendency for consultants (especially newer consultants that are less confident) to place a primacy on their own ideas, to ‚Äúhave the answers‚Äù and also to believe too strongly in their own approach - <strong>and in the process block the client from expressing their ideas</strong>.</p>

<p>At heart, the idea of yes and is about accepting the gambit from another actor and building on top of it - of opening up the world through the lens that they have offered and not attempting to close down their world and open your own - and spoiler alert, this is an effective approach to consulting!</p>

<p><em>Example: I remember consulting for The Wirecutter years ago (before they were acquired by the NYT) and attempting to convince them that they should create product review pages alongside their category pages<sup id="fnref:wirecutter"><a href="#fn:wirecutter" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I distinctly remember a conversation that went something like:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Me: There is a big opportunity in expanding into product review pages</em></li>
  <li><em>Wirecutter: But our brand is built on only doing these category reviews</em></li>
  <li><em>Me: But, you‚Äôre missing out on so much traffic</em></li>
  <li><em>Wirecutter: We only know how to do category reviews</em></li>
  <li><em>Me: You already have the content for these review pages!</em></li>
  <li><em>[Here we are blocked and the conversation is going nowhere]</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Instead, let‚Äôs imagine a conversation like this:</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Me: There is a big opportunity in expanding into product review pages</em></li>
  <li><em>Wirecutter: But our brand is built on only doing these category reviews</em></li>
  <li><em>Me: We‚Äôre excellent at doing those. Are there instances where the category reviews don‚Äôt work?</em></li>
  <li><em>Wirecutter: Hmm well in emerging categories where there isn‚Äôt a category but a single defining product for example Peleton is it‚Äôs own category and not really compared to anything</em></li>
  <li><em>Me: Yes! And do you think we could use our expertise in category reviews to provide reviews in these categories?</em></li>
  <li><em>[Here the client is engaged and ready to accept a new way of doing things]</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>This conversation is obviously both made up and exaggerated but hopefully it demonstrates the premise of opening up the client to new ideas through accepting their prompts and building from them rather than trying to block their ideas to talk about your own.</em></p>

<p>This approach relies on two powerful ideas - firstly that everyone (clients &amp; consultants included!) want their ideas to be listened to<sup id="fnref:listening"><a href="#fn:listening" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and that using the <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> conversation as a tool ends up with a co-created strategy.</p>

<h2 id="the-power--limits-of-co-creating-strategy">The Power (&amp; Limits) of Co-creating Strategy</h2>

<p>This <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> mindset quickly leads to a generative strategy situation where the ideas, strategies and projects are co-created between the client and consultant.</p>

<p>I imagine a ‚Äúbranching‚Äù visualization like this (blue for client, green for consultant):</p>

<p><img src="/images/yes-and-branching.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As I talk about in my <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/06/27/frameworks/">frameworks post</a> the co-creation process allows for more crucial client context to be part of the strategy (i.e. it‚Äôs more true) and it allows for more ownership from the client (i.e. the IKEA effect).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: Continuing the Wirecutter conversation above you can see how we‚Äôre already folding in more of the client context into the strategy and we‚Äôre already co-creating vs me (the consultant) just telling the client what to do. This process will better uncover exactly why these category reviews are part of their company DNA or more concrete examples of missed opportunities from not publishing stand alone review pages. This co-creation ultimately creates a shared vision of how we might move forward.</code></p>

<p>Of course - let‚Äôs get real for a moment the theatre of work and all this talk of improv only goes so far. You can‚Äôt keep building and bridging forever - and sometimes clients are simply going in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs useful to understand the situations where <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> is most useful and powerful. The answer is at the start of the engagement or session to establish a base reality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upright Citizens Brigade improvisational theory suggests that Yes And is only the most important tool to an improviser at the beginning of scenes, when they are obligated to establish a Base Reality. Yes And, in this view, expedites the process of finding a Who, What, and Where for the scene, allowing a context to solidify on top of which an absurd element can be found. - <a href="https://wiki.improvresourcecenter.com/index.php/Yes_And">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this idea - that the most useful thing you need client input and co-creation on is the ‚Äúbase reality‚Äù - the ‚ÄúWho, What, Where‚Äù. For consultants coming in from the outside attempting to ‚Äúsolve problems‚Äù for clients the biggest flaw in generic strategies is not properly accounting for who is at the company, what we‚Äôre actually trying to solve and where this strategy will play out<sup id="fnref:just"><a href="#fn:just" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And this can be useful because clients can ramble - they can get wrapped up in their arguments. This is no pejorative statement but rather just a function of how much time clients typically devote to ‚Äústrategy‚Äù and improv thinking.</p>

<p>So the <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> exercise can be powerful for co-creating strategy with clients accounting for their particular expertise and wisdom around the base reality of who, what where.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: in chapter two I illustrated a client where we have a shared joke for SEO consultants that come in and attempt to to improve content quality without appropriately understanding the base reality of content quantity being part of their cultural DNA. Of course early in the engagement I too was that SEO consultant coming in talking of content quality! Thankfully a keen intuitive sense of co-creating strategy with clients and opening up their ideas (rather than closing them down) led us to a place where we could get more nuanced and realistic around the quality/quantity ecosystem.</code></p>

<p><strong>Of note here is that clients often have a very keen intuitive sense of their specific market</strong> - while often failing to properly draw analogies from other markets that they are less familiar with. Helping clients understand adjacent and oblique markets can really aid their own generated strategies.</p>

<p>So long as the foundations are co-created with the client the consultant is then free to build on them with their own ideas and point of view.</p>

<p>All of this, however, relies on being able to get clients to a comfortable <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> mode in the first place. This co-creation process feels a lot like an improv session (or a series of sessions) and good improv requires two (or more) actors! Unfortunately, I sometimes find that <strong>clients are like blocked actors</strong>.</p>

<p>They have been trained to shut down their open-world generative side and they need coaxing and coaching to open up.</p>

<h2 id="unblocking-clients--original-strategy">Unblocking Clients &amp; Original Strategy</h2>

<p>Blocked clients are frustrating and confusing to work with - partly because it‚Äôs very difficult to disentangle your own presence from them being blocked and partly because you quickly hit personal bias, emotional ideas and feelings of identity and security‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>Here there be dragons.</p>

<p>Some of the ways I‚Äôve encountered blocked clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clients that expect you to ‚Äúhave the answers‚Äù because you‚Äôre expensive</li>
  <li>Clients who aren‚Äôt confident in their own position in the org chart</li>
  <li>Clients who have poor mental models of how their own teams work</li>
  <li>Clients who block because they‚Äôre uncomfortable ‚Äúdoing strategy work‚Äù</li>
  <li>Clients who block ideas by pre-emptively anticipating feedback from other execs</li>
  <li>Clients who block as a way of exerting high status</li>
  <li>Clients who are trying to set strategy by copying a competitor</li>
  <li>Clients who look for strategies that will make them culturally relevant or interesting<sup id="fnref:wisetoby"><a href="#fn:wisetoby" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>For all of these situations, Impro has delightful and rich ideas to help you coach actors into unblocking themselves. The book is very much about how to teach people to unblock themselves - which again is valuable for a consultant.</p>

<p>Many of these can be mitigated or helped through a default optimistic and positive attitude and mindset as outlined in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">chapter 2 - optimism as an operating system</a>. Remember the powerful phrase <em>‚Äúthis is a solvable problem‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at one specific situation that I see a lot however and that Impro has a particularly good solution for - the situation where a client expects original strategy or clever strategy from the consultant. From Impro:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Originality</p>

  <p><strong>Many students block their imaginations because they‚Äôre afraid of being unoriginal. They believe they know exactly what originality is, just as critics are always sure they can recognise things that are avant-garde</strong>.</p>

  <p>We have a concept of originality based on things that already exist. I‚Äôm told that avant-garde theatre groups in Japan are just like those in the West ‚Äî well of course, or how would we know what they were? Anyone can run an avant-garde theatre group ; you just get the actors to lie naked in heaps or outstare the audience, or move in extreme slow motion, or whatever the fashion is. But the real avant-garde aren‚Äôt imitating what other people are doing, or what they did forty years ago; they‚Äôre solving the problems that need solving, like how to get a popular theatre with some worth-while content, and they may not look avant-garde at all !</p>

  <p><strong>The improviser has to realise that the more obvious he is, the more original he appears. I constantly point out how much the audience like someone who is direct, and how they always laugh with pleasure at a really ‚Äòobvious‚Äô idea. Ordinary people asked to improvise will search for some ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô idea because they want to be thought clever</strong>.</p>

  <p>They‚Äôll say and do all sorts of inappropriate things. If someone says ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs for supper?‚Äô a bad improviser will desperately try to think up something original. Whatever he says he‚Äôll be too slow. He‚Äôll finally drag up some idea like ‚Äòfried mermaid‚Äô. If he‚Äôd just said ‚Äòfish‚Äô<sup id="fnref:fish"><a href="#fn:fish" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> the audience would have been delighted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully it‚Äôs obvious how painfully relevant this is for the client who expects ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù or ‚Äúclever‚Äù strategy. The simple ‚Äúfish‚Äù strategy is usually the right answer - and clients that expect extravagant or over-engineered strategies are actually blocking the consultant.</p>

<p>Impro has valuable insights and strategies here - and the good news / bad news is that the most effective way to unblock clients here is simple and hard: have them experience good improv.</p>

<p>The book walks through exercises and ideas for coaching actors into new ways of thinking and explaining the power of overcoming insecurity, overcoming trying to be original, overcoming status issues and so much more.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way to open up is through keeping this <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> refrain in mind - it reminds me to keep the positive edge and optimism. There are no bad ideas! Blocked clients often don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre blocking!</p>

<p>It keeps you in the beginner‚Äôs mind of accepting that the client knows their business better than you do - so you push them to generate new directions themselves rather than providing them ‚Äúanswers‚Äù of what to do.</p>

<p>And in fact ‚Äúanswers‚Äù and ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù are not really what we‚Äôre being hired for anyway‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="take-a-hard-look-in-the-mirror">Take a Hard Look in the Mirror</h2>

<p>All of this talk of blocked clients however misses something important - in my own work, 80% of the time when you feel the client is blocked - <strong>it is you the consultant that is blocking the client</strong>!</p>

<p>The consultant‚Äôs ego places a high value on your own ideas - you want to be the hero that has the ‚Äúright‚Äù answers. And in fact you can feel like a fraud if you work on a consulting project where you <em>don‚Äôt</em> have any original ideas.</p>

<p>This thinking will lead you into trouble.</p>

<p>Instead - remember that mostly there is no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù strategy and strategy is certainly not a stable idea - it‚Äôs an unfolding network of ideas. I love this quote from Stripe Partners:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. <strong>From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade</strong>. - source: <a href="http://www.stripepartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Stripe_Partners_Strategy_as_a_Network.pdf">strategy is an unfolding network of associations</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience when you feel a client is blocked the most useful default response is to <strong>move out of the way</strong>!</p>

<p>Look for ways to bridge from the client‚Äôs ideas to new directions that are only slightly divergent and position you to unfold into a correct strategy later on. This can be paradoxical to begin with (how can I feel good about helping the client go in the wrong direction?) but in fact the most useful thing you can provide the client is forward motion and momentum.</p>

<p>Shaping the strategy when it‚Äôs ‚Äúin-motion‚Äù is much easier than blocking and shaping the strategy from a standing start.</p>

<p>In fact - we can extend this idea further. There is no right or wrong strategy. Most consulting projects have nothing to do with solving problems - instead they‚Äôre all about building new capacities‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="consultant-as-capacity-builder">Consultant as Capacity Builder</h2>

<p>In Chapter 2 we looked at client organizations as ecosystems in balance. Even if we adopt <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> ideas and co-create strategies with our clients there will be a gap between the strategies on paper and the strategies in reality.</p>

<p>To this end, it‚Äôs important to understand the type of consultant that you‚Äôre trying to be: a ‚Äúproblem solver‚Äù or a ‚Äúcapacity builder‚Äù</p>

<p><a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/consultants-as-problem-solvers-or-capacity-builders/">This wonderful piece</a> sums up the two mental models:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Consultants are ideally capacity builders who develop links between research and practice rather than problem solvers. They provide methods and tools to help others expand their capabilities and skills on an ongoing basis, thereby transforming concepts into practical know-how and results</strong>. These consultants may have knowledge in a variety of areas, but the contribution they make is framed as building capacity for learning and interpersonal connections rather than providing expertise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They go on to identify four core mental models that separate problem solvers and capacity builders:</p>

<p><img src="/images/alternative-models-of-consulting.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Much like when I stumbled across ‚Äú<a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/">strategy &amp; stewardship</a>‚Äù this concept of ‚Äúcapacity building vs problem solving‚Äù gives language to something I‚Äôve known intuitively for a long time.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs going to be foundational to my thinking about consulting and I suggest you give this a close read: Consultants as problem solvers or capacity builders?</p>

<p>I‚Äôd go one step beyond this article however to argue that there are no problems inside organizations - <strong>a problem is just a point between two systems!</strong> (as per Chapter 2).</p>

<p>There are no problem solutions without building new capacities‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="build-new-capacities-by-interrupting-routines">Build New Capacities by Interrupting Routines</h2>

<p>For consultants that are embracing the nature of co-creating strategy and where we are aiming to build new capacities the central problem of consulting then becomes:</p>

<p><strong>How do we help clients move out of the status quo to do new things? And where will the resources for these new things come from?</strong></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs turn to Impro for inspiration again‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs Keith on the power of interrupting routines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If I say ‚ÄòMake up a story‚Äô, then most people are paralysed. If I say ‚Äòdescribe a routine and then interrupt it‚Äô, people see no problem</strong>. A film like The Last Detail is based on the routine of two sailors travelling across America with a prisoner whom they have to deliver to a prison. The routine is interrupted by their decision to give him a good time. The story I fantasised earlier about the bear who chased me was presumably an interruption of the routine ‚ÄòWalking through the forest‚Äô. Red Riding Hood presents an interruption of the routine ‚ÄòTaking a basket of goodies to Grandma‚Äô. Many people think of finding more interesting routines, which doesn‚Äôt solve the problem.</p>

  <p>It may be interesting to have a vet rectally examining an elephant, or to show brain surgeons doing a particularly delicate operation, but these activities remain routines. <strong>If two lavatory attendants break a routine by starting a brain operation, or if a window cleaner begins to examine the elephant, then this is likely to generate a narrative</strong>. Conversely, two brain surgeons working as lavatory cleaners immediately sounds like part of a story. If I describe mountaineers climbing a mountain, then the routine says that they first climb it, and then they climb down, which isn‚Äôt much of a story. A film of a mountain climb isn‚Äôt necessarily anything more than a documentary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this might seem less relevant for business contexts - this paralyzed reaction to ‚Äúmake up a story‚Äù is exactly the same as many employees and teams when faced with a question of ‚Äúdoing a new thing‚Äù (i.e. building a new capacity).</p>

<p>Further - employees and teams are heavily incentivized to <strong>maintain the status quo</strong>. Even if it‚Äôs made clear the importance of doing something new their muscle memory is built around maintaining and optimizing the status quo‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The trick is in interrupting routines. And there‚Äôs a good way and a bad way to do that.</p>

<p>The bad way to interrupt routines is through a deliberate intervention - something like an off-site. This forcibly removes people from the environment usually for a day or two of ‚Äúblue sky thinking‚Äù and ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù. There is a time and a place for them but mostly off-sites will allow for new ways of thinking but not new ways of doing.</p>

<p>Rather - the better way to interrupt routines is via a thorough understanding of existing workflows, processes and routines<sup id="fnref:logistics"><a href="#fn:logistics" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Most new capacities relate to an existing routine either directly or indirectly and the job of the consultant is to map the organization effectively to understand where and how we can interrupt to build new routines.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: let‚Äôs return to that Wirecutter example to see how the idea of ‚Äúgrowing organic traffic‚Äù translates into a co-created strategy for ‚Äúexperimenting with review pages‚Äù. So how? With what resource? Here the idea of interrupting routines is useful. Once you clearly understand how the workflow of research -&gt; planning - &gt; publishing works at a company like The Wirecutter you would be able to identify parts of the research &amp; planning routines that can be interrupted with new data or new insights to enable the teams to look at publishing review pages when the opportunities emerges from the data.</code></p>

<p>The trick is not to get new capacities off the ground from a standing start but to interrupt routines to get new capacities built ‚Äúin-flow‚Äù of existing teams and workflows.</p>

<p>This ‚Äújust in time‚Äù strategy of hijacking an existing routines in-flow and re-directing some portion of it into a new capacity experiment is way easier than getting a new process kicked off from a standing start.</p>

<p>Getting new capacities off the ground from scratch requires a herculean effort and while this is good for the ego complex of the consultant - as they imagine themselves moving mountains and molding the organization like clay - the truth is that our job is not to change the organization but to help the organization change themselves‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As I reflect back on the most effective consulting engagements I‚Äôve worked on it‚Äôs the ones where I was able to build a strong improv reflex with my client and where we had arrived at a <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> mindset between us - enabling us to co-create strategy with little regard for ego.</p>

<p>And the output? Usually the most ordinary of strategies that simply make deliberate movement towards important new capacities.</p>

<p>Up next in the <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> series we look at a new skill consultants need to learn: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">status switching</a>.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This is part 4 of the Yes! And‚Ä¶ series. Start with <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/">part 1 here</a>.</em></p>

<p>In <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">chapter 3</a> we looked at the difference between ‚Äúproblem solving‚Äù and ‚Äúcapacity building‚Äù consultants. Reframing consulting as capacity building opens up the ability to work on long open-ended projects with a fundamentally collaborative stance with the client. Per Paresha &amp; Philip<sup id="fnref:capacity"><a href="#fn:capacity" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúLong-term fulfillment of social obligations, as part of a community of practice.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike problem solving - capacity building fundamentally requires the consultant to learn how to get things done within the ‚Äúcommunity of practice‚Äù of the client‚Äôs organization -  working across a wide range of teams, people and projects.</p>

<p>The consultant - operating on a faster feedback loop than an employee - needs to learn how to map the org, sense the flow of power, and set the correct status all within a short span of time in order to get things done.</p>

<p><strong>Mapping &amp; navigating an organization requires appreciating that the org chart is a political map, drawn by those at the top of the organization and holding certain symbolic and functional power. But also only crudely (if at all) mapping to the actual power flows and status games inside an organization.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Getting things done and changing an organization begins with understanding the power dynamic of the people and teams involved.</strong></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with the org chart and gradually peel away the layers to get to deeper concepts like power potholes and status games‚Ä¶</p>

<h1 id="part-1-mapping-the-org-chart">Part 1: Mapping The Org Chart</h1>

<p>At the beginning of an engagement the org chart is all we have. Mapping an org chart starts simple and scrappy and rapidly evolves to something more useful. Here‚Äôs a sample sketch to illustrate how it works (and yes I often literally sketch these in my notebook):</p>

<p><img src="/images/org-chart-day-0.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Day 0 - initial contact</strong> - typically I don‚Äôt get much more information than the position title of the person looking to hire - ‚ÄúVP Marketing‚Äù or something similar.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - the first day of work</strong> - you meet a few people and begin to develop a rudimentary working assumption of the local org chart around your point of contact. So maybe there‚Äôs two teams that report into the VP and you have a name for the person running each team but little more.</p>

<p>However, especially in cases of  embedded work where I‚Äôm on-site with the client, by day 15 my understanding of the org chart might look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/org-chart-day-15.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At this point our fictional org chart map starts to show some new features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The VP point of contact is now situated relative to the CEO, relative to the growth executive team</li>
  <li>The CEO is loosely situated relative to the board</li>
  <li>Certain actors on the map are ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù - closed door conversations suggest certain VPs are on their way out (or have lost the faith of the CEO)</li>
  <li>Conversely, it‚Äôs becoming obvious that some actors are more effective than others - able to get things done inside the organization</li>
</ul>

<p>While this model of the org chart continues to evolve, it becomes less useful as a tool to ‚Äúnavigate‚Äù the organization. The legible connections between teams and people are clearer but the underlying power structures are only just starting to emerge.</p>

<h2 id="an-org-chart-is-designed-for-legibility-not-accuracy">An Org Chart is designed for legibility not accuracy</h2>

<p>Sketching out the org chart is helpful in the early days - but org charts are incredibly simplistic when it comes to actually mapping the organization. As <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/05/28/the-amazing-shrinking-org-chart/">Venkatesh says about org charts</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúA good deal of the process is about imposing anxiety-alleviating platonic structural beauty.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The org chart of boxes and lines shows reporting structures in a legible way, but does little else. If you‚Äôre using the org chart to get the ‚Äúlay of the land‚Äù it‚Äôs necessary to understand its limitations.</p>

<p><strong>The org chart tells us about the topology of the organization, i.e. the formal connections between people. It tells us nothing of the topography, i.e. the lay of the land. The messy distortions.</strong></p>

<p>Layering influence on top of a network topology starts to give a clearer picture of what‚Äôs really going on:</p>

<p><img src="/images/carto-network-graph.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This illustration comes from <a href="https://medium.com/@henrysward/the-shadow-org-chart-cfcdd644575f">a fascinating analysis that Carta conducted examining the influence inside their organization</a>.</p>

<p>This network-model showing a small number of highly connected nodes accurately represents the lived experience of working inside a dynamic and complex organization.</p>

<p>These network graphs however only tell you so much about power. The node graph above shows influence &amp; communication channels but not necessarily power flows.</p>

<p>For the consultant attempting to get things done - relational power dynamics are everything and as much as you‚Äôre understanding culture inside an organization, you need to understand the flows of power.</p>

<p>I start on day zero with a crude org chart sketched in my notebook, and over the first week convert the org chart into a network graph which then grows into a crazy wall<sup id="fnref:crazy"><a href="#fn:crazy" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> with key power players mapped.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-localized-power">Understanding Localized Power</h2>

<p>Once you‚Äôve mapped a few organizations - you begin to realize some key insights. Firstly - power is often centralized in a very small number of people. And these people are not always found in the c-suite.</p>

<p>There are three common types of people who hold power inside organizations - decision makers, gatekeepers and makers:</p>

<p><strong>Decision makers</strong> are the most common and most obvious type of power player - typically these are executives or senior employees. The kind of people who need to be consulted to make a decision - or have the latitude to make decisions themselves. One type of decision maker you might forget to pay attention to is the in-house expert with a history of success:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: I worked with a client where the executive team was mostly the usual suspects (i.e. old white dudes) but anytime the executive team got together they included a more junior senior director. This senior director had managed to get inside the inner circle not by seniority but by expertise - he was an expert at SEO strategy and when making decisions that impacted SEO the senior executive team would defer to him. This in-house expert can hold significant power because for certain decisions the exec team defers to them for sign-off.</code></p>

<p><strong>Gatekeepers</strong> come in two common forms, gatekeepers of time and gatekeepers of data. Executive assistants control significant power through owning executives time and schedule. Less obvious are those people who control access to data:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: I had a client where a small in-house data team was responsible for pulling reporting, generating analyses etc. The organization lacked robust dashboards or shared views of data so almost all requests for data went through the data team - this led to the situation of the senior leaders in the org consistently putting requests through the data team. This caused the team to wield significant power (while also overwhelming themselves via constantly getting urgent requests from the exec team).</code></p>

<p><strong>Makers</strong> are the least commonly understood power nodes in my experience. On the one hand it‚Äôs as simple as - those who can make things hold power - but on the other hand that doesn‚Äôt quite capture the unreasonable power that (often relatively junior) employees can have through being able to make things. This is especially true for people who can combine skillsets in unique ways:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: I worked with a publishing client a few years ago and I worked with a series of editors. Each responsible for a section of the website. Only one editor however combined the ability to make content with the sufficient know-how in HTML &amp; design to actually build new and innovative content experiences (i.e. page templates, in-line elements etc). As a result this editor ended up being a significant source of power - often pulled aside by senior execs to help build something new, prototype a new idea or just make something better in a hurry.</code></p>

<p><strong>There‚Äôs one universal rule to spot power nodes - look for who gets brought into the room.</strong></p>

<p>When an executive stops the meeting to demand someone else should be in the room - that‚Äôs a sign of significant power. When a conversation constantly references someone‚Äôs name (e.g. an exec assistant) that‚Äôs a sign of significant power<sup id="fnref:intheroom"><a href="#fn:intheroom" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-behavior-of-power-nodes">The Behavior of Power Nodes</h2>

<p>Once you realize that power is localized into a small number of people and that they are spread across the org chart - you need to pay close attention to the way those people operate. Their ways of working - while they might seem trivial - represent an opportunity for the consultant to accelerate their own learning curve and learn to get things done inside a client‚Äôs organization.</p>

<p>One example of this localized ways of working is what Venkatesh calls ‚Äúcalendar weather‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Consulting Tip #11: Pay attention to calendar management practices in client organizations, especially around senior executive schedules, and chat with admins whenever possible to learn the typical patterns of calendar craziness and how they cope.</p>&mdash; The Art of Gig (@artofgig) <a href="https://twitter.com/artofgig/status/1136316756967002119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>‚ÄúCalendar weather‚Äù is a great example of a small way of working - a localized piece of organizational culture that can have outsized impact when viewed through the lens of network graphs.</p>

<p>A key individual in the system can have mental models, ways of working or personal habits that can become associated with ‚Äúthe way to get ahead‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to get things done‚Äù. Emulating these ways of working and adopting them for your own projects inside the organization can instantly give you momentum.</p>

<h2 id="power-potholes">Power Potholes</h2>

<p>The opposite of localized power is power potholes. Areas of the org chart that at first glance might look safe (<em>‚Äúthey‚Äôre a VP! They should have buy-in and the ability to get things done!‚Äù</em>) but when leaned on turn out to be weak and can‚Äôt support your weight.</p>

<p>In the early days of a client engagement - watch and listen closely for unusual instances of cause and effect - i.e. when someone says or does something that doesn‚Äôt make sense. When something that you think should usually or rationally lead to X instead leads to Y you‚Äôre usually missing a hidden undercurrent of power.</p>

<p>Notice turns of phrase, rejected ideas or a statement that turns the room to silence. These mis-steps are power potholes in the consultant‚Äôs path. Notice them, write them down, meditate on them, and try and ask yourself: <strong>what power structures exist here to explain this anomaly?</strong></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example 1: in my own consulting work I led a design sprint to build a new product within the organization, using a VP as exec sponsor. Unfortunately, only during the project did I realize that the VP was weak and lacked buy-in and support from the other execs. In theory that VP should have supported that project but in practice, like stepping in a pothole accidentally, the system jolts and the project stalls for non visible reasons.</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example 2: In the early stages of a client project I‚Äôm trying to coordinate a new workstream - and I suggest that the editorial director can lead the review of existing content. I haven‚Äôt met this person yet and I‚Äôm leaning on the org chart and job titles. This idea gets rejected and new options emerge. This gives me pause in the moment (why not the editorial director?) but only later in the project do I realize that the editorial director is out of favor with the executive team.</code></p>

<p>Power potholes and localized power nodes matter for full-time employees too. Employees, however, have the luxury of time to settle into and understand power structures.</p>

<p>The consultant on the other hand, is on a tighter timeline and often operating cross-functionally far more than traditional employees so understanding these dynamics, and understanding them quickly is critically important to effective strategy work.</p>

<div class="tc i">&amp;</div>

<p><em>To wrap part 1 of this piece - it‚Äôs clear that to get things done inside a client‚Äôs organization you need to create your own map. Something more nuanced than the org chart that maps the flow of influence and power. Once you have this map you can better understand how things get done.</em></p>

<p><em>This perspective mostly treats the consultant as a silent observer. Now, in part 2 let‚Äôs more closely examine the role the consultant plays as an outsider entering and disrupting these power flows.</em></p>

<div class="tc i">&amp;</div>

<h1 id="part-2-the-consultant-has-no-place-on-the-map">Part 2: The Consultant Has No Place on the Map</h1>

<p>Understanding the flows of power on the map is one thing - understanding your own place in those flows is another entirely.</p>

<p>As we map the org chart and the network graph we begin to see: <strong>the consultant has no place on the map</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Capacity building consulting requires necessarily working across functions, teams and people.</strong> Momentum for new capacity inside organizations comes from getting buy-in and wind in your sails - which requires some kind of strolling across the organization<sup id="fnref:strolling"><a href="#fn:strolling" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, as you stroll across the organization there‚Äôs often no fixed home for the consultant, no stable identity to tie back to. The best you have is your executive sponsor as an anchor to the org chart, but even that can be tenuous depending how much autonomy you have.</p>

<p>I like to imagine the consultant as a quantum structure on top of a classical map (the org chart). While the map is fixed and tangible, the quantum structure behaves strangely and has bizarre properties like non-locality. This non-locality of the consultant brings with it an uncertainty with regards to power structures.</p>

<p>Employees inside the organization settle into a stable view of the existing power flows, while the consultant creates an unknown quantity - partly as an outsider and partly because capacity building explicitly requires building or re-arranging parts of the existing power structures.</p>

<p>For employees, status relationships are often stable and clear inside organizations. Not only who you report to but a vague sense of ‚Äúwho am I senior to‚Äù and ‚Äúwho is senior to me‚Äù.</p>

<p>But the consultant has no place on the org chart - in fact they ‚Äúmove around the org chart‚Äù constantly.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: an 18 month engagement might see me working across design, product, editorial, strategy, content, marketing etc over the course of the engagement as various projects and needs arise. This can be a mix of senior projects working with the VP Product or a small fast project working directly with the freelance content writers. The high/low and lateral movement across the org chart can be far and wide.</code></p>

<p>This lateral movement across the map requires a minimum social capital and charm to be able to appear in meetings or across teams without offending stakeholders. Winning hearts and minds across the org. This is a very high stakes and nuanced game<sup id="fnref:highstakes"><a href="#fn:highstakes" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The only way to play this high-stakes game is by realizing and recognizing status games.</p>

<h2 id="status-games--transactions">Status Games &amp; Transactions</h2>

<p>Because the consultant has no place on the map - they have no assigned status. This is unnerving at first and brings with it a unique challenge - the consultant has to set their own status.</p>

<p>It can be a shock to realize that your status relationships are not fixed - <strong>you have to set your status relationship with each person you meet individually</strong>.</p>

<p>This means that you might end up with strange non-continuous status relationships - i.e. you might be <em>above</em> the status of the VP of marketing in one context, but <em>below</em> the status of a marketing manager in another:</p>

<p><img src="/images/status-lines.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>While this might seem esoteric - status has ultimate power in determining your social interactions. Here‚Äôs a quote from the book Impro by Keith Johnstone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äò<strong>Try to get your status just a little above or below your partner‚Äôs,‚Äô I said, and I insisted that the gap should be minimal</strong>. The actors seemed to know exactly what I meant and the work was transformed. The scenes became ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô, and actors seemed marvelously observant. <strong>Suddenly we understood that every inflection and movement implies a status, and that no action is due to chance, or really ‚Äòmotiveless‚Äô</strong>. It was hysterically funny, but at the same time very alarming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a lot to unpack once you start noticing status transactions, particularly once you start to think of status as something that can be changed (again, from Impro):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All our secret maneuverings were exposed. If someone asked a question we didn‚Äôt bother to answer it, we concentrated on why it had been asked. No one could make an ‚Äòinnocuous‚Äô remark without everyone instantly grasping what lay behind it. <strong>Normally we are ‚Äòforbidden‚Äô to see status transactions except when there‚Äôs a conflict. In reality status transactions continue all the time</strong>. In the park we‚Äôll notice the ducks squabbling, but not how carefully they keep their distances when they are not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you establish status with everyone you meet your aim should be a ‚Äúminimal‚Äù status gap, as Keith suggests. Aiming to be slightly above or slightly below their status provides the most fruitful and effective environment to get work done.</p>

<p>But when to set high status and when to set low status?</p>

<h2 id="strategy-stewardship--status">Strategy, Stewardship &amp; Status</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve written before about my mental model for retained strategy projects: strategy &amp; stewardship<sup id="fnref:stewardship"><a href="#fn:stewardship" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs interesting about these two modes of work is that <strong>they often require blending different high/low status ideas</strong>.</p>

<p>Effective work looks something like this status 2x2:</p>

<p><img src="/images/status-2x2.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Working with executives: strategy is default high status, stewardship is default low status</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Working with employees: strategy is default low status, stewardship is default high status</strong>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs unpack that:</p>

<h3 id="strategy-status">Strategy Status</h3>

<p>During periods of strategy work there are typically two modes of working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gathering insights, data and knowledge from across the org</li>
  <li>Presenting work to execs or sparring with execs</li>
</ol>

<p>In 1) the consultant has to stroll across the organization and attempt to get knowledge, buy-in and insights from employees who likely have little clue who the consultant is, and have not worked with them before. Personally - I find the mode of low status most helpful here. Attempting not to assert authority but rather persuade that helping me gather information is useful for them too.</p>

<p>Conversely - in 2) I find the correct posture is high status. Executives almost universally thrive on confidence and presenting a strategy roadmap usually requires equal parts real experience and some projected confidence and enthusiasm for the ideas.</p>

<h3 id="stewardship-status">Stewardship Status</h3>

<p>When working on stewardship projects there are typically two modes of working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running processes, project management &amp; operations</li>
  <li>Reporting &amp; communicating those projects back to the exec team</li>
</ol>

<p>Here - the status is flipped. For 1) the most useful status is high status - essentially acting like a manager and leader to ensure that the wheels are turning, projects are shipping on time etc. Providing leadership and clarity for teams you‚Äôre working with that ‚Äúthings are OK‚Äù and ‚Äúhere‚Äôs why we‚Äôre doing this‚Äù.</p>

<p>And in 2) we‚Äôre acting more like a VP than a consultant - presenting low-status to report ‚Äúup‚Äù to the exec team on what‚Äôs going on.</p>

<p>Remember that ‚Äúhigh status‚Äù is more correctly ‚Äújust above the status of the executive‚Äù and ‚Äúlow status‚Äù is more correctly ‚Äújust below the status of the executive.</p>

<p>Why does this all work?</p>

<p><strong>Working with Executives</strong> - long term retainers work best when you start high status, i.e. where you can be the expert in the room. But over time no executive wants to <em>stay</em> low status so you have to switch at some point to them telling you what to do. This is a direct result of shifting from strategy to stewardship.</p>

<p><strong>Working with Employees</strong> - every employee is threatened by external consultants coming in so you have to begin by playing low status - this way you can gain their confidence. Then as you increasingly gain context for the business and knowledge of how they work you can switch to high status to begin owning stewardship initiatives you outlined early.</p>

<h2 id="fast-status-switching--improv-strategy">Fast Status Switching &amp; Improv Strategy</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs one more wrinkle. If we recall this chart of strategy (green) and stewardship (blue):</p>

<p><img src="/images/strategy-execution.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We see that neither line ever truly hits zero - there‚Äôs always some combination of strategy and stewardship.</p>

<p>And we know that strategy relies on spontaneous moments (see: the serendipity deficit from chapter 1).</p>

<p>A defining characteristic of executives is the ability to hold a short-term and long-term view at the same time. So a single interaction might blend both short-term priorities, tasks, operations and long-term vision and mission questions.</p>

<p>So as a consultant operating in the theatre of work, it‚Äôs possible that you have to switch status between tasks in a single day, <strong>or even harder - switch status within a single conversation</strong>!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at this sample conversation to illustrate (highly simplified and exaggerated):</p>

<p><em>Exec: Hey, when are we presenting the roadmap to the board?</em></p>

<p><em>Consultant: The meeting is set for next Thursday, but that means Mark the VP of product can‚Äôt make it because they‚Äôre on vacation.</em></p>

<p><em>Exec: Ok, do we have everything we need from Mark before he heads out on vacation?</em></p>

<p><em>Consultant: Yes. But actually I think we should remove the product section of the roadmap. I think we‚Äôre already presenting a complicated roadmap and we don‚Äôt have enough confidence in the product parts of the roadmap. I think it  would undermine our confidence that we have elsewhere in the org. Let‚Äôs take that section and trim it down to a few slides to show the full roadmap and impact as coming later.</em></p>

<p>Can you spot the status switch? Let‚Äôs mark up the same conversation:</p>

<p><em>Exec: Hey, when are we presenting the roadmap to the board?</em></p>

<p><em><span class="blue">Consultant [low status]: The meeting is set for next Thursday, but that means Mark the VP of product can‚Äôt make it because they‚Äôre on vacation.</span></em></p>

<p><em>Exec: Ok, do we have everything we need from Mark before he heads out on vacation?</em></p>

<p><em><span class="red">Consultant [high status]: Yes. But actually I think we should remove the product section of the roadmap. I think we‚Äôre already presenting a complicated roadmap and we don‚Äôt have enough confidence in the product parts of the roadmap. I think they would undermine our confidence that we have elsewhere in the org. Let‚Äôs take that section and trim to a few slides to show the full roadmap and impact as coming later.</span></em></p>

<p>Status-switching mid-conversation is a learned skill and much like a good consultant has to master context switching they must also master status switching.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Navigating a client‚Äôs organization requires appreciating that the org chart is a political map, drawn by those at the top of the organization and holding certain symbolic and functional power. But also only crudely (if at all) mapping to the actual power flows and status games inside an organization.</p>

<p>The consultant - operating on a faster feedback loop than an employee - needs to learn how to map the org, sense the flow of power, and set the correct status all within a short span of time in order to get things done.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This is the final piece of the 5-part Yes! And‚Ä¶ series exploring the relationship between the theatre of work and the consultant as improv actor. <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/">Catch up on chapter 1 here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Many independent workers are outsiders. However, as an indie consultant there‚Äôs often a pressure and anxiety to fit in - to step back inside ‚Äúthe system‚Äù working within the established processes and rules of the client organization.</p>

<p>This pressure to conform causes anxiety for an indie consultant - fitting in directly conflicts with your outsider and solitary nature - and gets magnified when working with high status actors like senior executives, CEOs, investors, and founders.</p>

<p>How do you resolve the tension of this duality - of being an outsider on the inside? As an actor outside the system, working to change the client‚Äôs systems the key is <em>remembering your purpose</em>:</p>

<p><strong>When helping clients do new things, your job is to fight the status quo. New things don‚Äôt emerge from fitting in</strong>.</p>

<p>Even further - <strong>in this post I‚Äôm going to try and unpack the ways in which you can feel empowered by not fitting in</strong>. In fact, the key is to embrace the ways in which pushing back against the status quo and leaning into your outsider status can be rewarding and fulfilling.</p>

<p>Remember: <strong>when helping clients do new things, their mental models and incentive structures actively work against the change needed. This puts you at odds with the status quo at their organization</strong>.</p>

<p>And yet, in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/">Optimism as an Operating System</a> I said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúIf you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you‚Äôll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which is it? How do we rail against the system without criticising the client? How do we create a positive environment and at the same time disrupt the status quo?</p>

<p>The archetype we‚Äôre looking for is the fool:</p>

<h1 id="part-1-the-fool">Part 1: The Fool</h1>

<p><img src="/images/der-narr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The fool represents someone outside the system - the archetype of the fool is the court jester, an advisor and confidant to the royal court.</p>

<p>In King Lear, the fool has the ear of the king and is the only one capable of telling the truth. In the tarot the Fool card is one of the major arcana and can be either un-numbered, or 0 (low) or 22 (high).</p>

<p>The fool is contrary, naive and uneducated -  but at the same time wise and capable of surprise and delight. An outsider, but with the ear of the ruling class.</p>

<p>The idea of the jester as a change agent has been explored before - this paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-25590-7_8">Fooling Around: The Corporate Jester as an Effective Change Agent for Technological Innovation</a> by Tom McMaster, David Wastell and Helle Zinner Henriksen<sup id="fnref:george"><a href="#fn:george" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has some great observations and draws parallels between key change agent traits and the traits of the jester:</p>

<p><img src="/images/corporate-jester.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So playing the fool can be effective if you‚Äôre seeking to drive change - but it‚Äôs not just about being effective, I believe the archetype of the fool runs deeper and independents can gain strength and power from playing the fool and not fitting in.</p>

<h2 id="the-contrary-fool">The Contrary Fool</h2>

<p>The <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> series (start from the beginning with <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/">part 1 here</a>) is inspired by the book Impro and here I want to draw inspiration from Keith Johnstone. He has a whole section called ‚ÄúNotes on Myself‚Äù where he has a passage on contrariness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Contrariness</strong></p>

  <p>At about the age of nine I decided never to believe any-thing because it was convenient. <strong>I began reversing every statement to see if the opposite was also true. This is so much a habit with me that I hardly notice I‚Äôm doing it any more</strong>. As soon as you put a ‚Äònot‚Äô into an assertion, a whole range of other possibilities opens out-especially in drama, where everything is supposition anyway.</p>

  <p><strong>When I began teaching, it was very natural for me to reverse everything my own teachers had done. I got my actors to make faces, insult each other, always to leap before they looked, to scream and shout and misbehave in all sorts of ingenious ways</strong>. It was like having a whole tradition of improvisation teaching behind me. <strong>In a normal education everything is designed to suppress spontaneity, but I wanted to develop it</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a perpetual outsider this idea of continual questioning, spontaneity and provocation felt true.</p>

<p>I re-wrote this contrariness section in my own words focused on my own practice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Contrary Consultant</p>

  <p>Every consulting engagement starts with reversing the client‚Äôs beliefs - challenging every foundational notion to see where there are strongly held beliefs, and where there are inconsistencies. A ‚Äúnot‚Äù opens up a problem and reveals all strategy is supposition anyway.</p>

  <p>During a consulting project it‚Äôs natural for me to misbehave in all sorts of ingenious ways relative to the status quo - to craft alternatives to the existing structures. Normal business operations are designed to suppress spontaneity but I seek to develop it.</p>

  <p>I have personally integrated these two archetypes - contrariness from Keith Johnstone and the fool from the tarot - into a personal approach to consulting that seeks surprise, questions over answers and can speak truth to power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea of contrary consultant - playing the fool archetype - is helpful because it reminds me that‚Ä¶ there is no choice. Indie consultants are often not just outsiders but <strong>perpetual outsiders</strong>. There‚Äôs a value in being contrary - but there‚Äôs no way out for perpetual outsiders. We‚Äôre often weirdos and oddballs who can‚Äôt help but question and poke the status quo‚Ä¶ So creating a sense of purpose, identity and acting that ‚Äúresolves‚Äù this tension is deeply important.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs take a closer look at themes of the fool: surprise, questioning &amp; speaking truth to power:</p>

<h2 id="surprise">Surprise</h2>

<p>Even though the client has hired you to change their organization - convincing them to change can still be challenging. Organizations are explicitly designed to prevent too much change too fast (even if many employees will deny this and corporate marketing will try to convince you otherwise). Think about how much chaos would be generated if every employee with an idea could act on it‚Ä¶</p>

<p>So, in order to convince a client to do something new, you need to be able to surprise them. To bring a client to not just a desire for change but also novel insight that provokes them to take action - to shake them from their status quo.</p>

<p>I wrote about interrupting routines to create surprise in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">chapter 3 - blocking and unblocking clients</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Yes! and... Chapter 3 - Blocking &amp; Unblocking Clients" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">
<p>This paralyzed reaction to the <i>‚Äúmake up a story‚Äù</i> prompt is exactly the same as many employees and teams when faced with a question of ‚Äúdoing a new thing‚Äù (i.e. building a new capacity).</p>

<p>Further - employees and teams are heavily incentivized to <strong>maintain the status quo</strong>. Even if it‚Äôs made clear the importance of doing something new their muscle memory is built around maintaining and optimizing the status quo‚Ä¶</p>

<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

<p>As weirdos, outsiders and fools we‚Äôre often well placed to generate surprise. It can come in the form of new insights about the industry &amp; competitors, it can come from questioning routine assumptions and ‚Äúthe way things are done‚Äù or it can come from just doing things in your own way.</p>

<p>These surprises are all designed explicitly to generate new momentum and to unblock clients - to demonstrate that there is a way forward when before there seemed none, to create new initiatives from scratch - and they require a healthy disregard for fitting in.</p>

<p>Before you can surprise a client, however, you need to find some truth - truths about the situation, about their beliefs, about the project you‚Äôre working on. This requires you to take the process of asking questions seriously.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>Remember how naive the fool is. Especially at the start of an engagement it‚Äôs key to try and assemble a mental model of the client‚Äôs organization from <strong><em>first principles - and the only way to that is through questioning</em></strong>. Questions are one of the most powerful tools you have as a consultant.</p>

<p>When you ask a question and the client answers how do you respond?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beginner consultant: <em>here‚Äôs an answer to your problem‚Ä¶</em></li>
  <li>Experienced consultant: <em>here‚Äôs some possible answers to your problem‚Ä¶</em></li>
  <li>Advanced consultant: <em>let me ask another question‚Ä¶</em></li>
  <li>Guru consultant: <em>ok, let me ask the same question another way‚Ä¶</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Don‚Äôt take shortcuts or assumptions - start at the beginning.</p>

<p>Leaping to the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù phase of consulting too soon is a mistake. (In fact many consulting engagements literally never get to the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù phase - there‚Äôs just a continual cycle of exploration). And further - clients are often pretty bad at describing their own problems<sup id="fnref:clientproblems"><a href="#fn:clientproblems" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Questions and inquisition are at the heart of good consulting - you can‚Äôt truly know the problem until you understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What the client thinks the problem is</li>
  <li>What the actual problem might be</li>
  <li>How the current system operates</li>
  <li>Why the current system caused the problem</li>
  <li>Why the current system can‚Äôt solve its own problem</li>
</ul>

<p>This requires a beginner‚Äôs mind - and a healthy curiosity. I wrote about this contrary line of questioning in my <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/09/23/workshops/">piece on workshops</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Workshops as Portals" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/09/23/workshops/">

<p>Playing the naive fool is perfect for asking ‚Äúdumb questions‚Äù that provoke reaction and surface truths - ideally some truths about the organization, the situation and your point of contact as a human - and allow you to get some insight into ‚Äúwhat is really going on here?‚Äù</p>

<p>Once we‚Äôve assembled some truths and we‚Äôve started some surprising behaviors it‚Äôs time to speak truth to power.</p>

<h2 id="speaking-truth-to-power">Speaking Truth to Power</h2>

<p>The unique viewpoint of the consultant - and the unique ability to act as an outsider (and a fool!) provide you as the consultant a special opportunity to say things that people inside the organization might have trouble with.</p>

<p>Remember - the fool in the tarot is part of the major arcana but neither high nor low. Often un-numbered. When working in highly political orgs I like to think of myself as the ‚Äúun-numbered VP‚Äù - part of the major arcana but unlike the others.</p>

<p>This ability to speak truth to power is a fine line - playing the fool and being an outsider doesn‚Äôt automatically give you the right to run your mouth. Instead you still need to carefully size your moments and positions to attempt to shine a light on the truth. Truth is dangerous. But the truth here can unlock great forces of change within an organization.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs three ways organizations are blind to the truth: blind to the obvious, blind to the outside world and blinded by politics. Let‚Äôs unpack them one by one:</p>

<h3 id="blind-to-the-obvious">Blind to the Obvious</h3>

<p>As a consultant trying to build new capacities you often end up ‚Äústrolling across the organization‚Äù - meeting many different parts of the business and working with teams and individuals at all levels and departments. When you stroll across the organization you often pick up a pretty complete picture of the organization as it is today without the frame and bias of previous experience, previous activity and history. In short - you get a clear eyed view of what is going on, without any baggage.</p>

<p>This allows you to point out things that are ‚Äúobvious‚Äù but that people internally might not want to talk about - or might have conditioned themselves to be blind to.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: Working with a media company to overhaul their strategy people were looking for big ideas - when the smallest idea was the most powerful. That the content was simply not good enough. People internally were so wrapped up in how the work was made, the process that made it, why it‚Äôs made etc that they ceased looking at the output in any objective manner and had abstracted it to reports in spreadsheets. My ability to point out that the output was simply not good and below competitors was helpful and surprising. No one argued that the content was high quality - but it was still a surprise for someone to point it out to them.</code></p>

<h3 id="blind-to-the-outside-world">Blind to the outside world</h3>

<p>In addition to strolling across the client‚Äôs organization, as a consultant you stroll across many different organizations as you work with multiple clients. As you stroll across organizations you‚Äôre able to bring a little bit of the outside in. Often, when I work with an organization, there‚Äôs a team who have been advocating for some change for a long time without success. They feel frustrated and demoralized because of their inability to change the system. Often (not always!) it can be the consultant‚Äôs place to dust off the argument and re-frame it with some additional external context that helps executives finally agree to the change<sup id="fnref:change"><a href="#fn:change" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: I was working with the market leader in a category who was getting complacent with growth. A simple survey of satisfaction of their website vs their competitors showed how their market position was under threat. I presented this alongside some internal change agents who had a suite of changes they wanted to lead and helped them gain executive buy-in through a sprinkling of external reality.</code></p>

<h3 id="blinded-by-politics">Blinded by Politics</h3>

<p>The consultant often holds a very unusual role inside an organization - simultaneously a senior figure and an outsider at the same time. <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">The consultant has no place on the map</a>. Because of this - especially in larger political organizations - it‚Äôs possible for the consultant to be able to say things <strong><em>without agenda</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, let‚Äôs be real, no speech is apolitical and nothing the consultant does is without agenda. But in the eyes of the CEO/board - a consultant can sometimes be seen as less biased than a suite of VPs all jockeying and vying for a small number of SVP spots. The consultant has their own agenda but it‚Äôs often orthogonal to the org chart and job title politics that VPs play.</p>

<p>In this way - the consultant can have a small voice and a big impact on issues where the organization is otherwise politically deadlocked. <sup id="fnref:sides"><a href="#fn:sides" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Example: working inside an organization attempting a large re-org each VP presented their own budgets and headcount plan to the c-suite. Obviously every team pitches for more than they need so the CEO turned to me as a more impartial judge of what teams actually need - not in a formal way but rather in a hallway conversation - I‚Äôm a source of ‚Äútruth‚Äù in a highly political situation.</code></p>

<p>Use this speech wisely.</p>

<p><em>So far we‚Äôve looked at productive, positive versions of the fool archetype - but negative versions abound. Now in part 2 let‚Äôs consider some of the potential flaws that come with being a perpetual outsider and weirdo‚Ä¶</em></p>

<div class="tc i">&amp;</div>

<h1 id="part-2-the-dangerous-fool">Part 2: The Dangerous Fool</h1>

<p><img src="/images/king-lear-fool-caption.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I‚Äôve spent the last few years actively seeking out and building a peer group of other indie consultants so I‚Äôve seen many different flavors of weird. There are as many different flavors of indie consultants as there are different flavors of rejections that drive us - because to be independent requires a rejection - either the system rejected you or you rejected the system.</p>

<p>Some start out weird and get rejected by the system - some get rejected by the system and, untethered from structure, become weird. Either way you develop your own sense of weirdness and eccentricity.</p>

<p>From all the indie consultants I‚Äôve met however there is a consistent behavior that can be dangerous - that is holding <strong>too tightly</strong> to your weirdness and outsider nature.</p>

<h2 id="productively-weird-vs-defensively-weird">Productively Weird vs Defensively Weird</h2>

<p>Many outsiders are distrustful and skeptical of ‚Äúthe system‚Äù - almost by definition the system has not worked for them - so they‚Äôre skeptical. And further, outsiders are fearful of conforming because it‚Äôs seen as the first step on a path to fitting in.</p>

<p>So outsiders rebel against the system - they become contrary, surprising and question everything. This is healthy but can be taken too far, this energy can be channeled in unproductive ways and can come across as <strong>defensive instead of generative</strong>.</p>

<p>I think about it like this: when asked to do something that feels like fitting into the system (such as lead weekly standups), I often find myself having defensive reactions and inclinations to distance myself. My knee-jerk reaction rejection and emotions span fear (what if I become just like an employee?), disgust (that‚Äôs beneath me) and distrust (do they see me as not capable of surprise?).</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to recognize when you are projecting these emotional responses on the client. Examples of this might include <em>‚Äúthis organization doesn‚Äôt have anyone to run standups?‚Äù</em> or <em>‚Äúthese standups are a waste of time‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúI should be doing something more important‚Äù</em>. These defenses are a response to the perceived threat of compromising your identity and position as an outsider, your fear of being ‚Äútaken over‚Äù by the organization.</p>

<p><strong>The game to play here is to view fitting in as a disruptive act. To enjoy fitting in - the fool masquerading as status quo. The joy of fitting in is understanding how the status quo works to successfully overthrow it.</strong></p>

<p>I like to think about this as focusing on <strong>generative destruction</strong> not <strong>defensive destruction</strong>. Remember - you‚Äôre there to change the client‚Äôs organization, but you‚Äôre not there to burn it down. And every client organization is likely far more functional than you give it credit for - sure there will be broken, counterproductive and inefficient parts of the system but the <strong>system as a whole</strong> is more functional than you think.</p>

<p>So pick your battles carefully - maybe you don‚Äôt want to lead the weekly standup meeting, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you should rail against stand up meetings as a practice. Maybe you don‚Äôt want to create a weekly report but by doing so you can attend the weekly executive meeting.</p>

<p>Forming a complete and integrated self identity is hard work and takes time (and by the way is something no one ever tells you when you start out on your own). I‚Äôve written about this before in my piece <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/27/i-consultant/">I, consultant</a> - but the gist is this: if you can find an identity you‚Äôre comfortable with you‚Äôll feel safer making ‚Äúinsider transgressions‚Äù - i.e. fitting in at times. And often you‚Äôll find that your assumptions about fitting in was flawed in the first place.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important to look in the mirror and attempt to clearly see the client <em>and</em> your own behavior in context. In <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">chapter 3 I claimed</a> that often you‚Äôre the one blocking the client:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Yes!%20and...%20Chapter%203%20-%20Blocking%20%26%20Unblocking%20Clients" data-author="@tomcritchlow" cite="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">
<p>All of this talk of blocked clients however misses something important - in my own work, 80% of the time when you feel the client is blocked - <strong>it is you the consultant that is blocking the client</strong>!</p>

<p>The consultant‚Äôs ego places a high value on your own ideas - you want to be the hero that has the ‚Äúright‚Äù answers. And in fact you can feel like a fraud if you work on a consulting project where you <em>don‚Äôt</em> have any original ideas.</p>

<p>This thinking will lead you into trouble.</p>
<footer>@tomcritchlow <cite><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/">https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/12/06/blocking-unblocking-clients/</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>
<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

<p>So tread carefully, question the ego and seek to develop a strong sense of identity. Swallow your pride and seek ways of generative destruction not defensive destruction.</p>

<p>Remember: your outsider identity gives you energy and drive but can be taken too far.</p>

<p>You have to be careful not to fit in for too long though‚Ä¶.</p>

<h2 id="the-dangerous-fool-outsider-or-outcast">The Dangerous Fool: Outsider or Outcast?</h2>

<p>The fear of the fool is to be an outcast. To transition from outsider to outcast (or worse to clueless). To be an outcast is to be an outsider that isn‚Äôt allowed in. For a free player consultant (vs a process consultant <a href="https://artofgig.substack.com/p/a-map-of-indie-consulting">see definition</a>) we‚Äôve explored the winning move of surprise, but there are two losing moves:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Fitting in for too long</strong>. Through fitting in and following the rules for too long we lose our outsider status and lose the ability to surprise our client. This path leads to employee-dom.</li>
  <li><strong>Being boring</strong>. Even if we don‚Äôt follow the rules and fit in - if we fail to bring surprise then we become boring for our point of contact. This path leads to being marginalized and ignored - an outcast.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can visualize this map in a 2x2  (drawn from the perspective of the free-player consultant or fool):</p>

<p><img src="/images/fool-2x2.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Becoming clueless - i.e. an insider incapable of surprise - is bad, but worse is being an outcast. The fear for indie consultants who are trying to ‚Äústay alive‚Äù (in the samo burja sense of <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/live-versus-dead-players-2b24f6e9eae2">live players and dead players</a>) is becoming an outcast - being fully and completely rejected not just by one organization but by all organizations.</p>

<p>When client work dries up I feel this existential terror. Have I stopped being able to surprise clients?</p>

<p>The way through this is to recognize surprise as a core part of your identity - to be weird in ways that bring delight to clients. To prance, dance and perform for clients in ways that test boundaries, that explore new territory and question assumptions but without being rejected wholesale and becoming an outcast.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Recognizing and developing a sense of identity that is true and strong as an indie consultant is hard. It‚Äôs a long road. I hope this <em>Yes! And‚Ä¶</em> series has given some hope for those wrestling with organizations - attempting to change them, to see them, to work with them without falling into clueless or outcast status. To be effective and playful.</p>

<p>I sent a draft of this piece to an old client and she said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúSending these over in case it sparks something‚Ä¶.</p>

  <p>Humor, Humility, and Humanity</p>

  <p>These are words that come to mind when I hear ‚Äúwink and a chuckle‚Äù. Initially I think Santa Clause and his deep belly laugh. I ask: ‚ÄúHow does one discover or sustain childlike wonder in the workplace? How do we find humor when stakes are high and serious means business? How do we find humility in a world that has historically rewarded hubris?‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than try and integrate this comment into the essay I want to leave it as is. How does one sustain childlike wonder in the workplace?</p>

<p>Form Keith Johnstone and Impro one last time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What happens in my classes, if the actors stay with me long enough, is that they learn how their ‚Äònormal‚Äô procedures destroy other people‚Äôs talent. <strong>Then, one day they have a flash of satori‚Äîthey suddenly understand that all the weapons they were using against other people they also use inwardly, against themselves</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps through changing clients we can change ourselves.</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">Mastering Chronos & Kairos to deliver just-in-time consulting</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>As a consultant you often find yourself working with multiple clients at once - switching between clients, contexts, businesses and engagement models. Sometimes several times a day.</p>

<p>This context switching can be exhausting.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt manage it correctly, you‚Äôll run out of time. You‚Äôll always feel like you‚Äôve got your back against the wall - feeling like you have to juggle multiple client projects while also running business admin and striving to keep generating new clients.</p>

<p>The title of this chapter is both the problem and the solution - to prevent the consultant from <strong>running out of time</strong>, the consultant has to <strong>operate outside the time perspective that your clients are operating in</strong>.</p>

<p>Both deadlines and deliverables are <strong>designed for legibility</strong> - for the control and measurement of work - <strong>not for effectiveness</strong>. Once we embrace this we can learn to operate on shorter, faster feedback loops where our goal is not creating deliverables and meeting deadlines but creating momentum and change.</p>

<p>This represents a mindset shift and different philosophy - that embraces context switching as core to the practice of consulting, and views context-switching as an advantage for the consultant. When done well, this approach allows you to work ‚Äújust in time‚Äù, rejecting formalized deliverables and instead working on smaller, faster, more effective pieces of work that can save you 80% of the time.</p>

<p>Operating this way is the key to dealing with multiple clients in parallel while avoiding burnout.</p>

<p>In short - you need to think about time and tempo differently.</p>

<p>Two ideas we‚Äôre going to return to often in this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Clock time</em></strong> is what the Greeks called <em>Chronos</em> - fixed, measurable, predictable time. Living in clock time is about carving time into fixed units. Employees inside organizations operate on clock time.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Narrative time</em></strong> is what the Greeks called <em>Kairos</em> - time moves when something happens. Living in narrative time is about carving time into events. Indie consultants operate on narrative time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, you can‚Äôt start a client engagement in narrative time, rejecting deliverables and deadlines - instead you need to navigate and transition from clock time to narrative time. We‚Äôll explore all of that in this post. But first, let‚Äôs look at how time works inside organizations to see why the status quo exists.</p>

<h1 id="part-1-clock-time-rules-the-world">Part 1: Clock Time Rules the World</h1>

<p><em>Clock time</em> is the operating logic of the working world - the time clock was invented to keep track of workers and calculate pay.</p>

<p><img src="/images/time-clock.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<div class="tc f5 i">Early time clock, made by National Time Recorder Co. Ltd. of Blackfriars, London</div>

<h2 id="employees-watch-the-clock">Employees Watch The Clock</h2>

<p>Employees think about time by watching the clock. It‚Äôs almost the defining characteristic of full time work - to be inside a structure that operates in predictable and measurable beats.</p>

<p>This is no accident. <em>Clock time</em> provides <strong>psychological safety and predictability</strong> for the worker and provides <strong>legibility and control</strong> for the employer. It‚Äôs part of the ‚Äújob to be done‚Äù of full time work - providing employees shelter from narrative time.</p>

<p>Employees are hired, paid and measured in fixed, measurable clock time.</p>

<p>This creates expectations and tempo inside an organization - for example it‚Äôs typically against the rules for someone to ask for a piece of work with &lt; 1 day turnaround<sup id="fnref:startup"><a href="#fn:startup" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>However, the further up the organization you go, the more you need to operate outside of clock time. Executives typically straddle clock time and narrative time, which is partly why being a manager/leader can be so draining. There‚Äôs no psychological safety of clock time; instead, you‚Äôre living according to narrative time. There‚Äôs no hiding behind your job description or your assigned priorities - when something needs to happen, it needs to happen, and you are supposed to find a way to make that work (often without disrupting your team‚Äôs clock time too much!).</p>

<p>Executives already understand that productivity measured in time is meaningless - there‚Äôs no hiding behind <em>‚ÄúI did the work you asked on time‚Äù</em>. It‚Äôs about progress, momentum, outputs, and results. And those things don‚Äôt work on clock time - they come in leaps and bounds, fits and starts.</p>

<h2 id="the-clock-chimes-midnight---its-crash-time">The Clock Chimes Midnight - It‚Äôs Crash Time</h2>

<p>Of course even employees aren‚Äôt completely sheltered from narrative time. Every organization has a clock and sometimes that clock crashes. Narrative time overwhelmingly washes over the organization and everyone is pulled into narrative time.</p>

<p>Sometimes this is an external event, like when a competitor launches a surprise, or some PR crisis happens. Or it can be an internal event, like when the CEO suddenly becomes obsessed with something new.</p>

<p>When the clock chimes midnight, suddenly everyone is operating on narrative time - ‚Äúwar rooms‚Äù, ‚Äúworkshops‚Äù, ‚Äúcrunch time‚Äù. Everyone is scrambling to operate on extremely tight feedback loops - a conversation in the morning has to affect what work gets done in the afternoon.</p>

<p>These periods are stressful for <em>Chronos</em> workers - being lifted out of clock time and into narrative time. The unwritten rules say that an organization can only do this infrequently to employees. It causes psychological anguish and burnout for clock-time employees.</p>

<h2 id="executives-operate-above-the-clock-line">Executives operate above the Clock Line</h2>

<p>At some point in every organization, as you get more senior, you can no longer operate fully on clock time. You cross over the clock line and into narrative time. Executives, operating above-the-clock-line are forced to live in narrative time - translating shifting real-time priorities into legible, predictable work for their below-the-clock line teams<sup id="fnref:lines"><a href="#fn:lines" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Where the clock line sits within an organization is highly variable, depending on the type and size of the company, but it‚Äôs usually one level below the ‚Äúsenior management‚Äù inner circle. The group of executives that is first called when ‚Äúsomething happens‚Äù is the inner circle and fully above the clock line.</p>

<p><img src="/images/clock-line.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="tc f5">Alive/dead players here as per <a href="https://medium.com/@samo.burja/live-versus-dead-players-2b24f6e9eae2">Samo Burja‚Äôs definition</a>.</div>

<p>As a consultant, it‚Äôs important to try and identify the clock line of the organization and recognize whether you‚Äôre above or below the line. Ideally, as you advance in your consulting career, you should be striving and aiming for above-the-line clients, projects, and points of contact.</p>

<p>But even if your primary point of contact is below the clock line, it‚Äôs important to recognize that every ask, deliverable, and project from the client likely started from an above-the-line ask:</p>

<p><img src="/images/clock-line-poc.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your point of contact might take a measured approach to the project, reflecting their below-the-clock-line situation, but there‚Äôs always a more urgent, narrative context somewhere above waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>Enter the Kairos Consultant.</p>

<h1 id="part-2-the-kairos-consultant">Part 2: The Kairos Consultant</h1>

<p>Understanding the clock line and the distinction between <em>chronos</em> and <em>kairos</em> is important for consultants that want to both control their own time management skills and become invaluable for clients by focusing on business value at all times.</p>

<p><img src="/images/time-out.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<div class="tc f5 i">Time Out by Dave Brubeck quartet with the magnificent cover from Neil Fujita</div>

<h2 id="deadlines-dont-exist">Deadlines Don‚Äôt Exist</h2>

<p>One of the best pieces of advice <a href="https://twitter.com/willcritchlow">my brother</a> ever gave me: Deadlines (as handed from client to consultant) don‚Äôt exist. This is the gateway drug to suspending clock time and existing purely in narrative time.</p>

<p>Typically, when you agree to a deadline with a client it‚Äôs to enforce legibility. It‚Äôs a way for the client to feel they‚Äôre in control and they‚Äôre getting their money‚Äôs worth, making sure the consultant is putting in the hours and doing the work.</p>

<p>But most of the time the actual deadline is entirely arbitrary and not linked to a dependency or decision.</p>

<p>For example, let‚Äôs say the client is looking for a complete competitive analysis. You discuss and agree to the deliverable 4 weeks from now. It‚Äôs a made up date that the client is using to control the relationship - to measure your output and ensure work is being done.</p>

<p>Where there is a strict time deadline, it‚Äôs because the work you‚Äôre doing is an input to something else.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>A real example from my own work - the client asks for a competitive benchmark, but when you offer a three-week completion time they push back. Asking what‚Äôs driving the urgency, you discover that there is a quarterly executive meeting next week and that they need two slides on competitive landscape for the presentation. Ok! Now we know where the real deadline is and what the real ask is - not only can we deliver that more easily in the timeframe but we also have a much better understanding of what this need is and who the stakeholders are. We can even go as far as creating the two slides for them (not something you‚Äôd typically create as part of a competitive analysis).</p>
</div>

<p>Once you‚Äôve been through this a few times, your instincts get honed; you‚Äôre always seeking the next level of insight into why you‚Äôre doing this work for the client and why now. Understanding the dependencies and temporal relevance of the work will unlock insights into the nested contexts of the work you‚Äôre doing.</p>

<h2 id="deliverables-dont-exist">Deliverables don‚Äôt exist</h2>

<p>Once you start seeking these insights and dependencies, you can start to unlock a more efficient way of working, and this is the heart of ‚Äútime management for independent consultants,‚Äù which is to <strong>only do 20% of the work</strong>.</p>

<p>You might think I‚Äôm joking, but it is kind of that simple.</p>

<p>Anyone who‚Äôs worked as a consultant or agency will tell you that only half of the work is useful. You just don‚Äôt know which half ahead of time!</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that you can train yourself to <em>guess</em> which bits are the most useful, and you can deliberately operate in ways that allow you to <em>discover</em> which bits are most useful.</p>

<p>How do you do this?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Understand the organizational context</li>
  <li>Understand the temporal dependencies</li>
  <li>Deliver a just-in-time rough version of the necessary deliverable</li>
  <li>Iterate as needed, while driving change through</li>
</ol>

<p>Always ask ‚Äúonce I deliver this piece of work, what will the client do with it?‚Äù What change or impact will it have? How can we drive towards that change/impact more directly, instead of chasing the deliverable, which is (likely) only a poor proxy in the first place?</p>

<p>The key here is delivering unfinished work. Delivering a WIP solution allows you to iteratively uncover the clients‚Äô reaction, and find out what they‚Äôre going to do with it.</p>

<p>How does this work? Here‚Äôs one mental model of doing work for clients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client request kicks off a discussion of some work to be done. A deadline is agreed with the consultant.</li>
  <li>Consultant works on the deliverable</li>
  <li>Some kind of review or presentation to the client</li>
  <li>Final round of revisions / polish based on the review</li>
  <li>Final delivery of the deliverable.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/a-to-b.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you‚Äôve operated in this way with clients, you‚Äôll notice two common failure modes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>While working on the deliverable, you often find that your initial assumptions of the deliverable are off - you don‚Äôt have enough information to do the work properly and/or you don‚Äôt have a clear enough understanding of what form the output should take</li>
  <li>When you finally wrap up the deliverable it isn‚Äôt that effective at the client‚Äôs organization - what did they do with it? What are the next steps?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here‚Äôs an example from my own work where adhering too tightly to the named deliverables wasn‚Äôt the approach</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>The client asked for an <strong>‚Äúaudience development strategy‚Äù</strong> and that was the line item in the SOW. I set to work and created a presentation that I‚Äôm still quite proud of - it‚Äôs a well crafted deck with a ton of good ideas. But I forgot to consider what the client would actually <em>do</em> with the audience development strategy.</p>

  <p>At the client review stage - when 80% of the hours from the SOW have already been used - the client starts to open up about which resources and which editors are able to pick up some of these projects.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs at this point that I realize the error of my ways - creating the strategy deliverable, a tight presentation has neglected to closely consider the lived reality of the client and their actual needs. Despite the fact that they asked for a strategy and pushed for it in the SOW - we would have been in a much better spot if we‚Äôd had more frequent check-ins and abandoned the formalized deliverable much earlier.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, with 80% of the hours spent crafting the presentation there‚Äôs not enough room left in the project to properly handle the project planning / scoping / prioritization that happens afterwards (that the client actually wants) and there‚Äôs not enough value from the work done for the client to extend the scope and buy more time.</p>

  <p>So the engagement ends and the client is only partially satisfied.</p>
</div>

<p>Instead, consider a way of working that‚Äôs more collaborative and more iterative. It might go something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client request for a deliverable</li>
  <li>Consultant sketches out possible outcomes, possible value - using back of the envelope data analysis or estimates</li>
  <li>Check in and review with the client - with a focus on ‚Äúhow do we act on this information?‚Äù</li>
  <li>Adjusting our final expectations and beginning work on implementation even before we‚Äôve finished our initial formalized deliverable</li>
  <li>Refining and polishing only those ideas that need formal presentation - and leaving the rest as estimates or outlines.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/a-to-c.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Four key advantages of this approach:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Collaborate and uncover the information you need (you shape the deliverable with the client) and understand why they need it</li>
  <li>By the second or third check-in you‚Äôre already moving forward, adding other people in the org to focus on the next steps as there‚Äôs enough clarity with the deliverable to move forward to the next step</li>
  <li>Less elapsed time for the client - it‚Äôs faster</li>
  <li>Less work time for the consultant - it‚Äôs more efficient</li>
</ol>

<p>And note - that often this approach leads somewhere different and more useful than you‚Äôd have arrived following the client request -&gt; deliverable model. See later on for a worked example.</p>

<p>This is uniquely tailored to the kind of consulting work that is improv based and capacity expanding. Some kinds of work are more formalized and require more hard deliverables. For example, you might need to create a brand deck as a polished object, or a website design.</p>

<p>But even for these more ‚Äúformal‚Äù deliverables, you can take a more iterative and collaborative approach to various sections or parts of the work. And never lose sight of the ultimate objective.</p>

<p>Some people call this approach outcomes over outputs, for example this project around web design that re-scopes based on <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/02/you-need-to-manage-digital-projects-for-outcomes-not-outputs">outcomes not outputs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taproot leaders described the system that they wanted to build in terms of its features: It would have a way for volunteers to sign up, a way for volunteers to list their skills, a way for nonprofit organizations to look up volunteers based on these skills, and so on. We were concerned about this feature list. It was a long list, and although each item seemed reasonable, we thought we might be able to deliver more value faster with a smaller set of features.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="recognizing--rejecting-formalized-deliverables">Recognizing &amp; Rejecting Formalized Deliverables</h2>

<p>The key to operating in this fashion is to scrutinize the formalized, named deliverables of your field. Every industry has their own language and concepts for what ‚Äúdeliverables‚Äù are expected. This standardization arises from a need for legibility and accountability - they arise because clients need standardized ways of asking for work from agencies, accepting proposals etc. Formalized deliverables however do not always map to where the most value can be created! Consider this list from the SEO industry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Site audits</li>
  <li>Keyword research</li>
  <li>Competitive analysis</li>
  <li>Link audits</li>
</ul>

<p>Or this list from the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/a-comprehensive-list-of-ux-design-methods-deliverables-2021-2feb3e70e168">UX design field</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Service blueprint</li>
  <li>Consumer journey map</li>
  <li>Personas</li>
  <li>Ecosystem map</li>
  <li>Competitive audit</li>
</ul>

<p>Legible deliverables that everyone agrees to are useful for clients to source bids from agencies, and for agencies to standardize and price work. But for independent consultants your advantage is operating on a different tempo - seeking more agile or alternative ways of working.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example from my own work. A client engaged with me to do an ‚ÄúSEO audit‚Äù of their site (the named deliverable). After spending a few hours poking around it was abundantly clear that the opportunity ahead was convincing the organization to create more content - not from optimizing existing content or fixing technology issues.</p>

  <p>After coming to this realization I presented some very small lift technical improvements that we can provide to the product team, outlined a rough back of the envelope market-size for the content opportunity and ran my client through my thinking.</p>

  <p>From here the back of the envelope market sizing became slightly more robust and my point of contact and I then called a meeting with the head of the editorial team to discuss ways forward and better understand budgets, expectations and outputs from the content team.</p>

  <p>In this example an initial request for a site audit becomes a faster, more iterative project that ends up exploring a business case for content investment - far away from the original ask but still focused on value for the client.</p>
</div>

<p>Note how in this example we never actually reach the polished deliverable stage - instead there‚Äôs a handful of WIP documents, decks and ideas. Depending on the size and formality of the client we might need a formalized content investment case but in this example the client is smaller and we can operate without formalizing into polished documents.</p>

<h2 id="doing-work-no-one-asked-for----aka-kairos-projects">Doing Work No One Asked For  - aka Kairos Projects</h2>

<p>If we double down on the idea of outcomes over outputs, it becomes obvious that there are certain types of work that we should instigate without asking. With the consultant‚Äôs unique view of the client (both client-as-organization and client-as-point-of-contact) we have the ability to spot self-directed and useful pieces of work.</p>

<p><em>Kairos</em> projects are things that nobody asked for, but which can be derived from the executives‚Äô outcomes, both personal and organizational.</p>

<p>The key, however, is not to sign up for arbitrary deliverables - but rather seek ‚Äújust in time‚Äù WIP versions of the work to provide value and create momentum.</p>

<p>Context-less plays often look very little like the formalized ‚Äúnamed‚Äù deliverables that your industry might expect. Some of the context-less plays I‚Äôve worked on recently:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building a quick but useful exec-level dashboard in Data Studio</li>
  <li>Creating a one-sentence narrative of the objectives of the executive to better communicate and organize the work across teams</li>
  <li>Providing a list of 20 candidates on LinkedIn that fit the profile of the VP we‚Äôre trying to hire</li>
</ul>

<p>Often this context-less work can feel junior or routine. The key is that we‚Äôre focusing on the highest value work right now - oftentimes the key to unlocking momentum and growth is not fancy or difficult, but rather it‚Äôs about just doing the right thing at the right time.</p>

<p><strong>The key idea is understanding the client‚Äôs objectives and anticipating their needs</strong></p>

<p>Consider this example where an executive is looking to create a growth marketing team from scratch. The red bubbles are the client‚Äôs objectives, and the yellow bubbles are the example ‚Äújust in time‚Äù <em>Kairos</em> projects that you might be able to work on to support those objectives:</p>

<p><img src="/images/kairos-project-examples.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="juggling-multiple-clients-in-kairos-time">Juggling Multiple Clients in Kairos Time</h2>

<p>Consultants are notorious for spending time embedded inside client organizations (in previous times, physically; now, remotely). This embedded nature can be taxing when it comes to juggling and managing multiple clients at once.</p>

<p>When you‚Äôre working with senior execs - say the CEO of one company and the CMO of another - neither wants you to be ‚Äúout of commission‚Äù for a few days at a time while you‚Äôre on-site with another client.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been in this spot many times and it‚Äôs taxing - juggling time on executives calendars is hard at the best of times, let alone juggling executive‚Äôs calendars at multiple clients at once.</p>

<p>The only way to handle this is by embracing the ‚Äújust in time‚Äù value creation and stealing time from one client for another. But that can only work if the kind of work you‚Äôre delivering is fast and small - not large and slow. In short, signing yourself up for <em>Chronos</em>-based deliverables will quickly jam your time capacity - whereas operating on <em>Kairos</em>-based just in time work can be juggled, rearranged and done just-in-time more easily.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve lost count of the times I‚Äôve taken a meeting for one client while technically working a full-day for another client. This kind of time splicing is the only way to handle the kind of <em>Kairos</em> effective consulting that I practice.</p>

<p>As Venkatesh points out - for clients that know you well, the more valuable a spontaneous conversation can be:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vgr-time-tweet.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Your employee-instincts will balk at the idea of responding to client emails in &lt; 10 minutes. But I use this as the proto example of a ‚Äúridiculous expectation‚Äù - except it‚Äôs exactly the kind of situation you find yourself in a lot as an independent.</p>

<p>The trick to responding to clients is not strictly high availability but rather a <strong>spider sense of the client‚Äôs stress</strong>. This enables you to parse in real time how dependent on you the client is.</p>

<p>However this cuts both ways. Sometimes you can work a ‚Äúfull day‚Äù for a client but have relatively little valuable work to provide, so spend time working on more effective work for other clients - safe in the realization that you‚Äôll do the same for this client when the need arises.</p>

<p>This approach is fully decoupling billable hours and clock time from value creation, and frankly can be existentially terrifying (‚Äúwhat are they paying me for?‚Äù) but is actually a completely sound approach so long as you‚Äôre always returning to your north star:</p>

<p>What are my client‚Äôs ultimate objectives and what is the most effective thing I can do for the client right now?</p>

<p>And being ok with the answer sometimes being: nothing (or very little).</p>

<p>This is because there‚Äôs a failure mode which is doing too much - disrupting the client‚Äôs system too much. Sometimes you need to let the work flow, let the changes propagate, observe, and wait.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt take this approach on day one though. You‚Äôd ruin your trust. So we need to map out how you transition from clock time to narrative time, from <em>chronos</em> to <em>kairos</em>.</p>

<h1 id="part-3-steering-by-chronos--steering-by-kairos">Part 3: Steering by Chronos / Steering by Kairos</h1>

<p>In order to be able to work on <em>kairos</em> time, we need to lay the groundwork and create the right environment. What ingredients are necessary to be able to operate in this way?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flexible / broad enough scope of work (SOW)</li>
  <li>Trust established between client/consultant</li>
  <li>A good understanding of your point of contact, their working styles and personality</li>
  <li>Enough wider context of the organization</li>
</ul>

<p>You likely won‚Äôt start an engagement with all these pieces in place. You can‚Äôt walk into an engagement and ignore their request for deliverables on day one.</p>

<p>However, it is equally true that if you‚Äôre still operating in a request -&gt; deliverable mindset six months into an engagement, you‚Äôre almost certainly not being as effective and valuable as you could be.</p>

<p>So you need to adapt your approach with a client over time. You start off steering by <em>chronos</em> and transition to steering by <em>kairos</em>.</p>

<h2 id="early-engagement-steering-by-chronos">Early engagement: Steering by Chronos</h2>

<p>In the original contract, you have to agree on deliverables and outline a timeline:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will do X by Y</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, at the beginning of the project the client needs, organizational dynamics, and project scope are almost always poorly defined and only map loosely to what the client actually needs and where you‚Äôre best placed to offer value.</p>

<p>However, it‚Äôs important to deliver on your initial deliverables - it‚Äôs how you build trust. In parallel however you need to be learning how to work with the organization, merging with their tempo and expanding your contexts so that you can eventually step outside of <em>chronos</em> time.</p>

      <td><em>Learn working style of your point of contact</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Good questions to reflect on if you‚Äôre finding yourself stuck in <em>Chronos</em> time:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Have I met my point of contact‚Äôs boss?</em></li>
  <li><em>Do I understand the top 3-5 priorities for the whole organization?</em></li>
  <li><em>What are my point of contact‚Äôs ambitions?</em></li>
  <li><em>Is my point of contact above or below the clock line?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This beginning engagement can last as short as a few weeks, or as long as six months, depending on how big the client is and how rigid the project is. During this period as a consultant, you‚Äôre mostly evaluated on the quality of your deliverables; how well you can deliver against the scope you‚Äôre given.</p>

<p>The failure mode, meanwhile, is not doing enough during this time to learn about how the organization actually works: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/06/24/navigating-power-status/">mapping power &amp; status</a> &amp; <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/29/ways-of-seeing/">understanding their culture</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually however, steering by <em>Chronos</em> and creating deliverable after deliverable will exhaust you - you‚Äôre stuck in a world of trying to be effective as a full time employee but with only a fraction of the time.</p>

<h2 id="switching-gears-to-kairos">Switching Gears to Kairos</h2>

<p>Switching gears mid-engagement is hard - the easy thing to do is to settle into established ways of working with your point of contact. But there‚Äôs always a way to go deeper.</p>

<p>Sometimes the client is working with you to change and focus on value creation over time billed, sometimes they‚Äôre actively working against it. Either way, your job is to seek enough organizational context for your work and for your point of contact to be able to see a way to deliver value beyond, around and in-between the defined deliverables.</p>

<p>As you spot these opportunities, it‚Äôs time to look for ways to cross the clock line and operate on a fast feedback schedule. This might look something like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>‚ÄúHey, want to spend an hour working on the board deck together?‚Äù</em></li>
  <li><em>‚ÄúYou know I had a thought about how we talk about this project internally‚Äù</em></li>
  <li><em>‚ÄúMind if I show you something I was just sketching out?‚Äù</em></li>
</ul>

<p>You‚Äôre basically inviting the client into a more collaborative, working relationship to explore work that sits outside of what a formal deliverable might look like.</p>

<p>As you begin to do this - you‚Äôll start to build up a relationship with the client where you can push back on more formalized deliverables:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>‚ÄúInstead of a full site audit let me just review the top priorities for us to discuss with the CPO?‚Äù</em></li>
  <li><em>‚ÄúInstead of a full customer research project let me talk to a few of the stakeholders across the leadership team and get their perspective and see what knowledge already exists inside the organization?‚Äù</em></li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of reframing of work helps teach the client that you‚Äôre focused on ultimate value, momentum, and outcome - not just the output of the deliverable.</p>

<h2 id="late-engagement-steering-by-kairos">Late engagement: Steering by Kairos</h2>

<p>Once you reach the stage of steering by <em>Kairos</em>, there‚Äôs no end to how deeply you can play this game, so long as you‚Äôre focused on value creation. At this point it‚Äôs possible to build a more explicit working relationship designed around <em>Kairos</em>. For example this is where I‚Äôve transitioned to a statement of work that reads ‚Äúone phone call a week‚Äù.</p>

<p>Once you‚Äôre operating on <em>Kairos</em> time you should be firmly anchored to creating value for your client-as-organization and client-as-individual. Helping the organization reach their goals, helping your point of contact succeed at their career, coaching them on new ways of working etc.</p>

<p>At this stage, the consultant is evaluated primarily by how effective they are, beyond deliverables and output.</p>

<p>Two examples of this transition from my own work:</p>

<div class="example">
  <p><strong>Example: operating within a complex organizational structure can slow down your intuition</strong>. I was working with a larger organization and had initially agreed to run a brand workshop for each of their 9 sub-brands. This was a fairly large scope of work and a meaty project from the outset. Operating on-site with the client 3 days / week, however, made me feel like I would have a good chance of getting inside the client‚Äôs context to shift from deliverables to something more useful.</p>

  <p>However - at least 3 months of work was spent running these brand workshops - planning, running, synthesizing, wrapping up. This deliverable-based work trapped me in <em>Chronos</em> time longer than I would have liked - partly because the client had a fairly complicated matrix organizational structure. It wasn‚Äôt at all clear who held the power and status inside the organization - with multiple layers of leadership for each of the sub-brands.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, although we threw much of the workshop work away it was a necessary phase of work to build trust with my primary point of contact as well build trust across large parts of the organization. I was fortunate enough to throw much of it away and move onto more valuable projects better oriented to delivering value for the client but it‚Äôs a good reminder of the challenges of understanding your client‚Äôs organization and how it can slow you down.</p>

  <hr />

  <p><strong>Example: for smaller clients you can often break out of Chronos time in days not weeks</strong>. I was working with a startup a few years ago and we had agreed to a single day workshop to begin the project. This was the scope:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/sow1-kairos.png" alt="" /></p>

  <p>Following this initial day of work not only did I have some trust from the VP marketing, but we also had an agreed view of where value creation would come from. The follow-on scope looked like this:</p>

  <p><img src="/images/sow2-kairos.png" alt="" /></p>

  <p>But - note that all of the legibility and deliverables here are designed for finance gatekeepers. The actual work was already momentum and value based.</p>
</div>

<p>In both of these examples, it‚Äôs the business size and complexity that dictates how quickly you can switch <em>Chronos</em> for <em>Kairos</em>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúJazz is about freedom within discipline‚Äù - Dave Brubeck</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Kairos</em> consulting is an attempt to find freedom with discipline - to seek value creation even over adhering to the agreed scope and shape of work. It‚Äôs the only way to successfully integrate multiple high-value clients at the same time without reaching burnout.</p>

<p>To be clear this <em>Kairos</em> approach is not somehow a way to be lazy on client projects. It‚Äôs just orienting your north star to your client‚Äôs north star and finding a way to manage your own time in the process.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you will find your own tempo and balance of formalized work and improv work - and that‚Äôs a good thing. The specific balance and approach will need to fit your own working style, your type of work and your typical client profile. But one thing is clear - getting trapped in clock time is discipline without freedom.</p>

        <h2 class="postsubtitle">Putting together an independent life without falling apart</h2>  

        

        
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>As I write this I‚Äôm feeling stretched thin - my background anxiety is elevated and my brain feels slightly scrambled. I only have a modest amount of client work right now but I‚Äôm juggling three distinct types of work: consulting, a new venture<sup id="fnref:seomba"><a href="#fn:seomba" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and writing this book.</p>

<p>These three activities are very different - not only are they different types of work, but they have different incentive structures (client revenue, self directed revenue and personal project) and different tempos. Trying to balance different types of projects that each have varying tempos and incentives is exceptionally challenging and choosing tradeoffs between them is emotionally taxing. How much consulting money am I willing to give up to be completely focused on writing for a day? This is not a theoretical or a simple question.</p>

<p>Unfortunately independent living is full of these emotionally taxing tradeoffs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Am I willing to turn down this client project in order to take a vacation?</em></li>
  <li><em>Can I really turn down this client project to work on my side project?</em></li>
  <li><em>After no clients for two months suddenly I‚Äôve got three clients all kicking off next week!</em></li>
  <li><em>How do I find uninterrupted time for deep work when managing this client project means I have to be on-call?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The way to understand these questions is to better understand the shape of our headspace, to better understand the shape of independent work and to understand our personal energy flows.</p>

<p>This requires some introspection and as we saw in part 1: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/26/kairos/">The Consultant Out of Time</a> it requires questioning the underlying assumptions of how we think about time. It turns out that once you give up the 9-5 you literally give up the clock and have to rebuild a time schedule that works for you from first principles.</p>

<p>Hopefully this allows us to navigate independent living without burnout.</p>

<p>First, why headspace is not a ‚Äúspace‚Äù at all:</p>

<h1 id="part-1-headspace-is-a-non-euclidean-space">Part 1: Headspace Is a Non-Euclidean Space</h1>

<p><img src="/images/blue_recursive.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="tc f5 i"><a href="http://www.donrelyea.com/site2014/space-filling-curves/">Generative art based on a space-filling curve for non-Euclidean geometries</a></div>

<p>Our metaphors matter and ‚Äúheadspace‚Äù is a particularly bad one, because headspace is not a ‚Äúspace‚Äù that fills up ‚Äî or rather if it is a space it fills up in some strange ways. In mathematics there‚Äôs the notion of Euclidean space which is another name for regular space (forward, backwards, parallel lines never cross - that kind of thing). In Euclidean space, space is uniform and regular. Every 2x2 box is the same size.</p>

<p>Non-Euclidean spaces however are strange spaces with their own rules - in some non-Euclidean spaces it‚Äôs impossible to have parallel lines. Space can be irregular - a 2x2 box might be bigger or smaller depending on where it is. And it turns out headspace is more like a non-Euclidean space - with strange properties.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs impossible to segment your headspace into neat boxes. Sometimes small tasks consume large amounts of headspace. Sometimes two kinds of projects can‚Äôt exist side by side. These properties mean that understanding your own headspace is a tricky concept.</p>

<p>If we think about headspace being a regular space then we might think that we can simply measure how full we are by measuring the amount of work we have committed to: <em>‚Äúhow many hours am I billing this week? How full is my workload?‚Äù</em>. Meaning, we tend to like to categorize our headspace into neat boxes and definitions.</p>

<p>But this model maps very poorly to the lived experience of your actual headspace and stress. Instead we need a more nuanced perspective that accounts for a variety of factors. Determining which factors influence your headspace requires a little introspection and self-analysis, but here‚Äôs some of the things I‚Äôve identified in my own work:</p>

<p><strong>Things that increase stress:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A new client takes significantly more headspace, time and energy than an ongoing client.</li>
  <li>Every new client adds incremental stress, independent of the amount of work for them (and this might be exponential! 4 clients is manageable, 5 is very busy and 6 is crazy)</li>
  <li>A change in point of contact with a long-term client can be as stressful as a new client.</li>
  <li>Not understanding the client‚Äôs org chart can consume additional cycles trying to second-guess the organizations behavior and reaction to your work</li>
  <li>A client that uses a non-familiar communication channel (e.g. Teams if you‚Äôre used to Slack, or Outlook if you‚Äôre used to Gmail etc)</li>
  <li>Clients with the same schedule (e.g. regular Monday morning meeting) can cause a lot of tension where you are forced into repeated time collisions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Things that decrease stress:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If multiple clients are very similar, that can reduce stress - whether it‚Äôs similar type of work or similar working style.</li>
  <li>A familiar working relationship reduces headspace because it makes client interactions more predictable and understandable</li>
  <li>Long term clients tend to consume far less headspace than new ones</li>
  <li>A clear understanding of work that needs to be done</li>
  <li>A clear understanding of the client‚Äôs org chart</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-examples">Some Examples</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at some real examples from my work. Here‚Äôs October 2018 vs. January 2020 where each color is a different client and size is dollar amount.</p>

<p><img src="/images/oct-v-jan.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Which month felt more stressful?</p>

<p>If you simply look at total billing then Oct 2018 is slightly less than Jan 2020. But anyone who‚Äôs operated as a freelancer or consultant will obviously recognize that two clients is far less stressful than 4, even if those two clients are larger.</p>

<p>If we want a quick and easy method of analyzing headspace you can look at the major factors which are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The number of clients</strong> (more clients = more stress, independent of size)</li>
  <li><strong>Is the client new?</strong> (new clients = more stress)</li>
  <li><strong>How many distinct types of work are there?</strong> (more distinct types of work = more stress)</li>
</ol>

<p>These major factors help explain most of the variance in headspace, but it‚Äôs not the full picture. Let‚Äôs take a look at this period:</p>

<p><img src="/images/busy-summer.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>During the summer of 2018 I had the highest billing months for my consulting business ‚Äî six clients at once for two consecutive months! This period definitely felt like I was ‚Äúfull,‚Äù but I wasn‚Äôt over the breaking point. Why? Because if you look closely, there‚Äôs some nuance:</p>

<p><img src="/images/summer-closeup.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Three key factors led to being able to cope during this period without burnout:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Three clients (the bottom three in the diagram) were long-term clients ‚Äî all at least 10 months+. This leads to an ability to quickly context switch into and out of that work.</li>
  <li>Two big clients (middle red/blue in the diagram) were for exactly the same kind of work ‚Äî audience development work for two media companies. This leads to a lot of redundancy and efficiency in headspace, this was a lot of solving one problem and applying it twice.</li>
  <li>I was well-rested from a quiet period in the previous four-months.</li>
</ol>

<p>This kind of mental accounting is useful as an exercise in self-reflection, to better understand your own mental headspace and how it relates to what your total capacity might be.</p>

<p>We looked at the major factors that influence headspace above, but let‚Äôs look at some other factors (mostly ones that are harder to quantify):</p>

  </table>

</div>

<p>I‚Äôm sure you can adjust and add to this table based on your own experience and personal style too.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs one aspect of headspace that I want to call out specifically though because it‚Äôs so dependent on your individual style - client availability.</p>

<h2 id="headspace-is-a-function-of-client-availability">Headspace Is a Function of Client Availability</h2>

<p>Every client comes with very different expectations and demands for your availability. Not just the time commitment, but what is the expected response time? When a client email lands in your inbox how quickly do you feel you need to respond?</p>

<p>This is a critical question because it‚Äôs going to dictate how much work you can handle at once and your overall stress levels. It‚Äôs not just about the client‚Äôs communication style and expectations but how compatible your working style is with the client‚Äôs.</p>

<p>Some independent consultants are just not comfortable being highly available to clients. And if that‚Äôs true then you need to design your offering and consulting work around it otherwise you‚Äôre constantly going to be fighting clients who want higher availability!</p>

<p>I‚Äôve written about this before - specifically about how ‚Äúexecutive sparring‚Äù (work limited to 1:1 sessions with a senior executive)  has extremely small time demands outside of the sparring session itself, whereas managing a client project launch might require responding to slack pings from multiple teams in real time throughout the week. In general, ‚Äúdoing‚Äù work requires you to be much more available and on-call than ‚Äúthinking‚Äù work - with executive sparring having perhaps the best money/availability ratio. From my notes on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/05/28/sparring-and-tenure/">Sparring as Tenure</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So is sparring just an intellectually stimulating but less-well-paid version of consulting?</p>

  <p>No ‚Äî there are some clear benefits of chasing sparring as consulting.</p>

  <p>Firstly, I‚Äôm a decade younger than Venkatesh and still able to pull stunts like billing 3 days a week to one client while also billing 3 days a week to another client. Dipping into energy reserves and sprinting on work for sustained periods throughout the year. Much like physical fitness I can already feel my capacity for this declining.</p>

  <p>Secondly, ‚Äúdoing‚Äù work captures a larger portion of your head space. When you‚Äôre managing a marketing org you can‚Äôt ‚Äútake Thursday and Friday offline to write blog posts‚Äù. Operational work requires high availability and an ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù mentality. Especially if you‚Äôre in doing mode for multiple clients at once. It can be incredibly demanding on your time and any side project / writing / teaching / long-term research gets consistently interrupted, paused or put on hold.</p>

  <p>In a nutshell, sparring work is long-term stable, well-paid work relative to the amount of headspace and energy required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different kinds of work will have different demands on the availability of your time.</p>

<p>For example, if you‚Äôre in the habit of running four-day brand sprint workshops, then you should expect to be deeply immersed for those four days (and likely some days before/after) and almost entirely unavailable for other clients or projects. However, you may well be largely free outside of the workshop ‚Äî with client demands being minimal.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no right or wrong type of work ‚Äî but you should closely interrogate your own working styles and recognize how stressed it makes you to be on-call with clients. Personally, I have three client email addresses and three client Slack groups, and I don‚Äôt mind having a high availability for each of them. But some consultants I know can‚Äôt stand that low-key background stress of being available at any time for clients.</p>

<p>And be mindful of signing clients for small amounts of money that have high availability expectations.</p>

<p>Ok, so now that we have a more nuanced understanding of the shape of our headspace we can start to do things with it.</p>

<h1 id="part-2-headspace-pricing-and-downtime">Part 2: Headspace, Pricing and Downtime</h1>

<p>Understanding the shape of headspace is a mostly intellectual exercise so let‚Äôs look at some practical applications - and see how headspace and total capacity relate to the shape of independent work (which is most definitely not stable and predictable!).</p>

<h2 id="pricing-in-the-pain">Pricing in the Pain</h2>

<p>One of the best non-obvious pieces of pricing advice I was given is that <strong>you should always price projects so that you‚Äôre happy if they say yes</strong>.</p>

<p>What does this mean? It means pricing in the drag on your headspace - taking into account the factors above and beyond simply the time commitment, but looking further to the headspace commitment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think the client is going to be a nightmare to work with? Charge more.</li>
  <li>The organization‚Äôs structure and complexity is opaque to you? Charge more.</li>
  <li>Slammed with work right now and this will be your 5th client? Charge more.</li>
  <li>The work is going to be high-availability? Charge more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer back to the ideas above around what causes a client to take up additional headspace and you‚Äôll find a set of factors that you should consider when pricing up a project.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs OK to put yourself at or over your max capacity if you deliberately choose to, but doing it accidentally or doing it with underpriced work is a huge mistake that leads to burnout. Make sure you‚Äôre getting paid for sprinting at max capacity.</p>

<p>And speaking of max capacity‚Ä¶ what is the shape of independent work? Turns out it‚Äôs not at all stable and consistent.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-yourself-for-the-peaks">Preparing Yourself for the Peaks</h2>

<p>One of the defining features of independent work is the variable nature of clients. How much work you have at any point is variable ‚Äî how much money you‚Äôre earning is variable too.</p>

<p>Because your client load and income are going to fluctuate, it‚Äôs important to consider your total base capacity and your burst capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Total base capacity</strong> is how much work you can comfortably manage over long periods of time. Understanding this will give you a sense of your baseline income and the sustainability of your consulting model.</p>

<p><strong>Burst capacity</strong> is how much work you can handle at a sprint for a limited time (think one to three months) at absolute maximum capacity without burning out.</p>

<p>While it might seem that total base capacity is more important, in reality most indie consultants spend their months at 50-80% base capacity so the number is not that meaningful - what <strong>really</strong> impacts and dictates their workload and income is their ability to handle burst capacity.</p>

<p>Look again at this chart:</p>

<p><img src="/images/capped-capacity.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The red dotted line here is roughly equal to my max base capacity. Note how I‚Äôve spent a few periods consistently around this limit but most of my work is 50-80% max base capacity.</p>

<p>Your natural instinct might be to stop accepting work that goes over your max base capacity. After all, what‚Äôs the point of having a max capacity if you‚Äôre going to ignore it? But if I‚Äôd capped my work there I‚Äôd have missed out on a significant chunk of revenue.</p>

<p>Adding a ceiling to your client work has a real impact on your revenue - not only do you lose out on in the immediate revenue <strong>but almost certainly lose out on the lifetime revenue from that client</strong> (most clients aren‚Äôt particularly flexible on starting date and if you miss that window you‚Äôll most likely lose the client completely).</p>

<p>For example - if you look at the above image where the red line is drawn, in 2018 I would have had 27% less revenue from being unable to take on those projects.</p>

<p>This is a common feature of variable systems - one study showed that if you‚Äôre investing in the stock market and miss the 5 best days a year you lose <a href="https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/tempted-to-sell-missing-just-a-handful-of-the-best-stock-market-days-can-tank-your-returns/">35% of your returns</a>!</p>

<p>Independent consulting can feel the same way - highly variable client leads make your revenue highly variable and attempts to ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù this revenue are mostly tilting at windmills. Instead you should embrace that your workload (and revenue) is going to fluctuate and prepare best you can for the bursts - increasing your burst capacity (without burnout!) is essential.</p>

<p>So if your ability to handle peaks (without burning out!) is directly related to your earning potential, how do you get better at dealing with peaks?</p>

<p>This requires operating outside of traditional time expectations and rejecting deliverables as we saw in the <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/26/kairos/">last chapter</a>. But it also requires learning the skill of efficient context switching.</p>

<h2 id="learning-the-skill-of-context-switching">Learning the Skill of Context Switching</h2>

<p>Just like transaction costs are at the heart of economics for firms, context switching costs are at the heart of indie consulting economics. Learning good context switching, and splicing time from one client into another client, is generally good practice and will serve you well ‚Äî but the skill becomes essential during peak periods.</p>

<p>Context switching is basically the tax you pay for switching between one client and another. People‚Äôs initial idea about context switching is you need to be able to build good onramps - ways to ‚Äúget up to speed quickly‚Äù but actually the secret is building good off ramps - ways to save your current position in a task/project/client and freeze it so you can come back to it later.</p>

<p>For Venkatesh - note taking is a key activity for context switching between clients:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Art of Gig" data-author="Free Cogs" cite="https://artofgig.com/">
<p>Once I started my note-taking, all that changed. Meeting sequences began to feel like steady forward progress with very little&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlash_(engineering)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backlash</a>. Context-switching&nbsp;<em>between&nbsp;</em>clients got much more pleasant (particularly important on days when you have back-to-back meetings with entirely different clients, which I try to avoid, but sometimes happens).</p><p>Clients often don‚Äôt recognize the value of the notes initially. Superficially, it seems like make-work. But as the relationship develops, they realize that it‚Äôs the core of why sparring with an external consultant is valuable at all. Even if you never refer back to the notes, and your client never does either, the very fact of writing them up lends a smooth continuity to the conversation track, and a sense of accumulating insight and value. It is at the heart of the deliberate practice element in executive sparring.</p>

</blockquote>
<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

<p>In my own work  I find a few things provide the ability to ‚Äúsave state‚Äù and perform rapid context switching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keeping personal notes on every meeting - these are distinct from meeting minutes. Personal notes preserve context about things like emotion and include my own commentary on things I noticed or observations about power and status, unexpected actions etc.</li>
  <li>Writing down a clear north star metric for every engagement that maps to the highest level ambition of the client (the key is to actually write this down, not just try and remember it!)</li>
  <li>Communication by default - so that whatever I‚Äôm working on is shared with the client and not a surprise (so we can both get up to speed fast)</li>
  <li>Keeping a mini ‚Äúclient control center‚Äù where I meticulously keep handy all of the links to the key documents, project management login URL etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="just-in-time-downtime">Just-in-Time Downtime</h2>

<p>If preparing yourself for the peaks is important, it‚Äôs just as important to prepare yourself for the troughs. Those slow times can be paralyzing and demoralizing for independent workers.</p>

<p>The best advice I got when I started out consulting (thanks Dave!) was to make the most of your downtime. When you have free time, make sure you use it to recharge and rest. For me this is biking and kung-fu (and blogging!). And it‚Äôs important to give yourself permission to take downtime and recharge ‚Äúon the clock‚Äù during the work week.</p>

<p>Taking a bike ride at 11am on a Tuesday might feel like slacking off but it‚Äôs actually a crucial part of operating as an independent consultant. Because when 3 clients all sign at once and the work peak arrives there‚Äôs no smoothing function and there‚Äôs no team to back you up - you just have to buckle up and dive in.</p>

<p>During these peaks you‚Äôre likely going to be working long hours, nights and weekends and letting client demands walk all over your personal time. If we‚Äôre ok with client work encroaching on our downtime, shouldn‚Äôt we be comfortable letting our downtime encroach on our working time?</p>

<p>This isn‚Äôt theoretical. If we look again at my all-time peak, the only way I handled it without burning out was the rest and downtime I‚Äôd opportunistically taken for myself the previous months:</p>

<p><img src="/images/downtime.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This advice is easier said than done of course - especially when you‚Äôre newly starting out. How do you have confidence in your system to be able to take breaks before you‚Äôre reliably generating income?</p>

<p>This is a tough chicken/egg problem to crack - my best advice is to surround yourself with other independent workers to be able to observe their behavior. Having a desk at a coworking space full of independents in year 2-3 of my indie journey allowed me to absorb the working styles of independents. It‚Äôs all over the place, evenings, weekends, late starts, early starts, weeks without coming into the office. All kinds of behavior - but most crucially everyone takes breaks as needed, not when the breaks are scheduled.</p>

<h1 id="part-3-the-energy-matrix">Part 3: The Energy Matrix</h1>

<p>OK great, we solved the headspace equation and completed the jigsaw of independence! Yes, well, actually no not quite.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs another component ‚Äî your motivation and your energy. Not only how busy you are but how <em>satisfied</em> you are. This is more complicated. You can be ‚Äúat capacity‚Äù but feeling on top of the world, or you can be only partially full with work and feeling despondent and without motivation.</p>

<p>While working with Sunil, my executive coach a few years back, he opened my eyes to this energy matrix - a diagnostic tool to understand where satisfaction comes from. It‚Äôs incredibly simple and adaptable to your needs, but in essence it works like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify a set of ‚Äúthings that are important‚Äù ‚Äî these are types of activity that you find important and/or provide you with energy.</li>
  <li>Score every major project with a score (I use -1 to +3 but it‚Äôs not an exact science).</li>
  <li>Add up the rows to find out which projects are giving you the most energy.</li>
  <li>Add up the columns to find gaps in your satisfaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs a real example from that max capacity period before, when I had six clients at once:</p>

<p><img src="/images/energy-matrix.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>For me, I identified eight core things that provide me value:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Leading others</strong> means aligning teams, providing direction and generally playing a leadership role.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning and being challenged</strong> means pushing myself into new situations, learning new things.</li>
  <li><strong>Giving energy</strong> means motivating and encouraging others, building others up.</li>
  <li><strong>Face to face</strong> means feeling that adrenaline rush of meetings, workshops, and presentations live.</li>
  <li><strong>Creative</strong> means having creative outlets ‚Äî from mocking up landing pages in Figma to outlining a creative strategy in Slides.</li>
  <li><strong>Authoring</strong> means publishing writing to the internet.</li>
  <li><strong>Connecting the dots</strong> means building my network and making good connections between people.</li>
  <li><strong>$$$</strong> means paying the bills and sustaining my family.</li>
</ul>

<p>Identifying these is not trivial, but the good news is you can update them easily!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15lGRi1oM7ZAJz-Ezgo2i5XXWZBXyhf8Fbk9sV1yHJEY/edit">Here‚Äôs the above matrix in a spreadsheet for you to copy</a> (but remember to identify your own values!)</p>

<p>It‚Äôs crucial here to look at the full spectrum of projects, everything that fits inside your ‚Äúindependent identity‚Äù container. Not just the client work but all the side projects, blogging, writing etc. I called this post the ‚ÄúJigsaw of Independence‚Äù because unlike in full time work you get to choose the makeup of projects.</p>

<p>As an independent worker you can assemble a patchwork quilt of client work and personal projects that sum up to a satisfying workload. But this work needs to be intentional and deliberate otherwise you‚Äôll end up at the whims of client work. Instead you need to strategically assemble a patchwork of projects that you can spin up/down just in time, as needed, to scratch your itches and fill up the various buckets.</p>

<p>In fact this is part of the promise of indie consulting - instead of a monolithic single commitment that needs to fulfill all of your needs you can add and subtract commitments to balance, and evolve, your needs as you go. And you can balance revenue generating projects with non revenue generating projects just fine!</p>

<p>This is all part of the never ending process to define your own identity as an indie consultant now that you‚Äôre on your own and no one is telling you who you are anymore‚Ä¶</p>

<h1 id="part-4-grinding-gears-between-chronos--kairos-living">Part 4: Grinding Gears between Chronos &amp; Kairos living</h1>

<p>So far the key to a sustainable independent lifestyle is operating outside of traditional time scales - operating on Kairos time, not Chronos time. We do this by embracing just in time work, dealing with burst capacity and grabbing rest with just in time downtime.</p>

<p>Some things don‚Äôt change though - we still need the same fundamental things as full time workers: identity, vacations, financial security, satisfying work. The key difference is that for full-time workers you re-evaluate these things infrequently - typically when you move from one role to another.</p>

<p>But indie consultants - kairos workers - are able to re-evaluate these things continually with much more flexibility and iteration. This can be a blessing and a curse as we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Understanding and embracing this transition ‚Äî from discrete step changes to an always-on mindset ‚Äî can be difficult. You have to unlearn ways of operating in your personal and professional life that are deeply ingrained. You need to rewire your personal operating system.</p>

<p>And, further ‚Äî there‚Äôs no boss to rail against except yourself. As Venkatesh wrote in the Art of Gig<sup id="fnref:offline"><a href="#fn:offline" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>The key point here is that there‚Äôs less stability and less commitment as an indie consultant. Change is always available - which means your personal development is ‚Äúalways on‚Äù and will change in many small steps vs big discrete jumps. Just like we should adopt a kairos mindset to consulting work we should adopt a kairos mindset to personal development. At the same time however, because everything happens in increments, there‚Äôs very rarely any external validation that ‚Äúyou‚Äôve made it‚Äù in the same way that a promotion or new job might provide this sense of achievement.</p>

<p>I was an indie consultant on day 1 when I quit my job with zero clients and income and I‚Äôm an indie consultant today almost 7 years in with over a million dollars of income from consulting. The path from one to the other has been a meandering adventure with no clear breaks or jumps‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs illustrate this with an imaginary example. Let‚Äôs say I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to do UX design consulting work. I can change my website, update my ‚Äúhire me‚Äù page, change up my creds deck and write a blog post or two about UX design. The same day, I‚Äôve already pivoted my identity. But at the same time all I‚Äôve done is update things directly within my control. The question is how much do I buy my own BS? How much do I feel like a UX designer vs just feeling like a fraud?</p>

<p>The point here is not that one way or the other is better (though, I have some thoughts) but rather there‚Äôs a tradeoff in both directions and you need to understand that being indie is fundamentally, structurally different from being a full time worker. Not just because of the freedom, but because of the lack of support, structure and validation.</p>

<p>The inner game of consulting is all about creating mental models for thinking about time, energy and headspace. You need to learn how to understand and manage your own psychology if you‚Äôre going to survive.</p>

<h2 id="grinding-gears-between-chronos-and-kairos">Grinding Gears between Chronos and Kairos</h2>

<p>One danger for independent consultants ‚Äî trying to match your just-in-time living with chronos workers. I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a kairos household; my partner runs her own business and makes picture books, so we‚Äôre not operating on chronos time.</p>

<p>But trying to line up kairos and chronos living can be tough.</p>

<p>Taking time off is a great example of where gears grind. The mental model of work/rest from chronos living doesn‚Äôt translate well to kairos time</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quote from a fellow independent consultant that articulates some of the angst and psychological gear grinding when chronos and kairos meet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am constantly hearing people say to me - ‚Äúyou work too much. You need to slow down. Take a break. Shouldn‚Äôt you be working less as a consultant? Isn‚Äôt that the
point?‚Äù</p>

  <p>I just about worked from Jan straight through summer, - 7 days always on - even in Cannes, even in pretty beachside places.. and phew, summer is always full on as a consultant. And this year, I paid a hefty price of stress on my body and thus am dealing with it. So now am taking 4 weeks off (as best I can which means just one client vs many - I am, me after all) in the fall. The response is, ‚Äúmust be nice. Wow. Who gets to do that?!‚Äù</p>

  <p>If I change the dialogue to, ‚ÄúI certainly feel I earned some time off‚Äù‚Ä¶ I get the same response. ‚ÄúWow, must be nice to not have to work all the time. Consulting must be great business!‚Äù</p>

  <p>I‚Äôve really struggled with not feeling frustrated with these comments and taking them personally. Taking a set bulk of time off doesn‚Äôt mean I work less. Having flexibility to go to things during the day also doesn‚Äôt mean I work less than others - it‚Äôs a different cadence.</p>

  <p>When we work on our own, or own a small business - we get amazing flexibility. But we also don‚Äôt have fixed incomes and ‚ÄòPTO.‚Äù PTO - ha! On your own, you have to use different muscle and motivation to often work doubly hard and smarter. Over the years, I‚Äôve felt that sometimes the guilt of not working, is so intense it‚Äôs hard to actually commit to a break‚Ä¶ Someone a few weeks ago told me, as solo entrepreneurs - you are always future-minded, and the present can be a challenge sometimes to simply put pencils down and live in it. That resonated with me. Sometimes I think I‚Äôm getting better at it. Sometimes it‚Äôs two steps back.</p>

  <p>But hopefully, finding a way to let go of that judgement I‚Äôve felt when people say - wow must be nice.. and instead just say, YUP IT IS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen to this. The independent life is full of new kinds of tradeoffs, and this can cause a lot of friction when Chronos and Kairos meet. We can return to that chart above to better understand where gears can grind:</p>

<p>Part of the problem here is that it‚Äôs easy to describe the differences between full time (chronos) work and indie (kairos) work - but you don‚Äôt really internalize and understand the differences until you live them. And many of these changes happen to deep rooted concepts like financial stability, identity and our sense of self worth.</p>

<p>Because the indie path removes all sense of validation, credentialing and identity you might have to take some things seriously even if they‚Äôre not client work. Assembling and recreating all the pieces of a full-time career is non trivial and requires a patchwork assemblage of projects - the jigsaw of independence.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-the-only-way-out-is-in">Conclusion: the only way out is in</h2>

<p>The key insight underpinning everything here is that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>As an independent worker your relationship to time, stress, money and rest all need to re-negotiated. To create a sustainable independent path you need to create new routines, new ways of working and new ways of skiving off.</li>
  <li>Navigating these changes requires a deep introspection and self-analysis to notice how you feel when you‚Äôre busy, to notice what kinds of work light you up, to notice how you feel when you‚Äôve got no work.</li>
</ol>

<p>It‚Äôs not that the only way out is through, but rather the only way out is in(side). You need to learn to be self aware in a continual way - to be always keeping track of your stress, motivations, incentives and energy.</p>

<p>Walking the path of an indie consultant you will learn to live an alternative path outside of all kinds of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù structures - this can be disorienting and demoralizing but ultimately it puts you in control of your own time, energy and identity in a way that full-time work can‚Äôt.</p>

<p>I remember clearly in the early days of consulting ‚Äî I met someone I respected who managed a ton of different projects at once ‚Äî it was noon outside Whole Foods. He had his feet up on a bench, sitting in the sunshine and eating some sushi.</p>

<p>I asked him, <em>‚ÄúHow do you do it? You do so much and you‚Äôre sitting here eating sushi!‚Äù</em> He said, <em>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple; you can do it too. The sushi is right inside and it‚Äôs only $10.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Your mindset and your energy dictate your capacity far more than actual time ‚Äî Chronos time. Learn to embrace kairos time and just-in-time living to build a more sustainable independent practice and better understand your own headspace.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>Co-authored by Tom Critchlow &amp; <a href="https://subpixel.space/">Toby Shorin</a>. Toby‚Äôs edits are <span class="contributor">marked in purple</span>.</em></p>

<p>The thing no one tells you when you set out on your own is that you take on the task of managing your own labels. Inventing terms to describe who you are and what you do.</p>

<p>This can feel like <em>‚Äúsoft‚Äù</em> work - somehow less important than the <em>‚Äúreal‚Äù</em> work of finding clients, setting up an LLC, etc. But the truth is that the labels you use to describe yourself are crucial to your self-identity in the world of independent work.</p>

<p>And, counter-intuitively, creating labels is hard not because they have to work for others (clients, friends etc) but because the label has to work for you.</p>

<p>Of course labels are external by design - they play a role in how you position and market yourself. But the struggle for labels happens internally - the real audience is the person looking back at you in the mirror. A label you can feel comfortable and confident with.</p>

<p><em>Do I justify this label?</em></p>

<p><em>Am I really good enough to be X?</em></p>

<p><em>Who am I to charge clients for Y?</em></p>

<p><em>What am I doing?</em></p>

<p><em>What do I want to be?</em></p>

<p>These days I call myself a consultant. But I‚Äôve been doing this 4.5 years and it‚Äôs only recently that I feel comfortable really embracing that label. In this post I‚Äôm going to walk through how labels can help you charge more, where the angst comes from and how to deal with ‚Äúthe question‚Äù as an independent‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="tend-to-your-labels-as-you-grow">Tend to your labels as you grow</h2>

<p>When you‚Äôre fully employed, you get a steady paycheck but you also get a <strong>stable, recognized label</strong>. You say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a product manager at IBM‚Äù (for example).</p>

<p><span class="contributor">Toby Shorin: This label is affirmed in speech and action by your colleagues, who interact with you through and on the terms of your role. You fit into your employer‚Äôs org chart, a map of possible role-labels which exist as constituent pieces within the whole of the business entity. ‚ÄúImposter syndrome,‚Äù then, is simply the neurotic inability to accept others‚Äô recognition and confirmation of your given label.</span></p>

<p>But when you step out on your own you suddenly remove the construct that provides this plug-and-play identity and are left to make one up on your own. When you first leap into this unknown it‚Äôs often easy to describe who you are - you‚Äôre defined by what you just left.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI just quit Google to head out on my own.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúEx-McKinsey Partner.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúWork &amp; Co Alumni.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>This framing is easy and safe - and it‚Äôs totally ok to lean on this. While you will feel the urge to create new labels and framing for yourself it‚Äôs ok for this process to take some time and in the interim you can just tell your story.</p>

<p>As the days turn into weeks and months though, new language will emerge.</p>

<p>When I headed out on my own into the world of independent work I used the word ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù to describe the kind of client work I was doing, largely because I used the term ‚Äòconsulting‚Äô when I was doing client work at the agency Distilled pre-Google.‚Äù But it didn‚Äôt feel right to call myself a ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù yet.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve done client work before, it might feel instinctive to use whatever word you used then.  But now that you‚Äôre out on your own, and you‚Äôll likely wrestle with the kind of language you feel is ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúearned‚Äù:</p>

<p><em>Self-employed</em>? Sure. (though that implies that I‚Äôm paying the bills?)</p>

<p><em>Freelancer</em>? Probably. (though that implies a short term version of full-time work?)</p>

<p>As you head into the unknown of independent work you should worry less about this label - <strong>no one will care about it as much as you do</strong> - and it‚Äôs less an absolute definition of who you are and more a process of growing into the person you want to be.</p>

<h2 id="the-internal-angst-of-labels">The internal angst of labels</h2>

<p>As you journey through the independent adventure you‚Äôll have to invent your own labels. Maybe many labels! As you try them out you‚Äôll likely wrestle with them and lose sleep over them (I know I did!).</p>

<p>Again - labels have the dual property of being external and internal. They‚Äôre external in the sense that you‚Äôll use them on your website<sup id="fnref:website"><a href="#fn:website" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, your twitter bio and in conversation. But from my own experience this external nature of labels takes a backseat to the inner hand-wringing and discomfort that comes with trying to describe who you are and what you do.</p>

<p>This inner angst of labels comes in three ways:</p>

<p>Firstly, <strong>you imagine that this label matters externally</strong>. Positioning is often discussed in the context of ‚Äúmarket positioning‚Äù or ‚Äúpositioning statement‚Äù - something that helps potential clients find and engage with you. That‚Äôs true, to a degree. But for many independents the label is less important externally than it is internally. Clients tend to look for evidence, content, associations and perspective that aligns with theirs. They tend to be indifferent to the specifics of the label you use (e.g. a consultant or a freelancer).</p>

<p>Secondly, <strong>you imagine that you have to earn</strong> your label. That somehow others have the power to <em>grant</em> you use of a label. No one has that power, but a lot is riding on the shared belief that institutions can and do control this power. Part of being untethered and free-floating independent is existing outside of the gatekeeper infrastructure.</p>

<p><span class="contributor">TS: In contemporary society, we are rarely given the opportunity to define for ourself who we are. Schooling and employment are at their essence a series of ‚Äúgates,‚Äù an exercise in conditional label-granting. As youth we are told, with terrorizing frequency, that we cannot do things without first obtaining a title, that we are valueless without some authority giving it to us. As a result of this training, suddenly having the opportunity to define and own one‚Äôs own label can be piercingly uncomfortable. We ask ‚Äúwho am I?‚Äù‚Äîbut there is nobody there to answer us. Faced with this profound discomfort of unboundedness, we instinctively seek limits and obstacles. We project gatekeepers in front of us, to protect us from responsibility for our own identities.</span></p>

<p>Thirdly, you have to reconcile your <strong>personal and professional identities</strong>. Choose a label too whimsical and you‚Äôll worry that people won‚Äôt take you seriously, but choose a label too corporate or commercial and people will think you‚Äôre too boring. Striking a balance here is necessary and will vary wildly from industry to industry. Remember you can have multiple labels just like you have a multi-faceted identity<sup id="fnref:whitman"><a href="#fn:whitman" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><span class="contributor">TS: Just as becoming independent challenges the distinction between work time and personal time, it also challenges the distinction between your professional and personal self-perception. When are you acting as a ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù or ‚Äúfreelancer,‚Äù and when are you acting as ‚Äúfather‚Äù or ‚Äúpartner?‚Äù Lines between networking and making friends blur, and it becomes necessary to get comfortable with these overlapping labels.</span></p>

<h2 id="psychic-armor-for-the-arena-of-capitalism">Psychic Armor for the Arena of Capitalism</h2>

<p>Making labels is not just aspirational and emotional - there‚Äôs one key functional benefit: <strong>helping you charge more money for your work</strong>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll tell you a secret: every time I send an invoice to a client I want to throw up<sup id="fnref:vomit"><a href="#fn:vomit" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If you Google around everyone will tell you to ‚Äúraise your rates‚Äù or ‚Äúcharge more‚Äù. They‚Äôre right. But it‚Äôs also not so easy!</p>

<p>Having the self-confidence and authority to command premium rates is intrinsically linked to a sense of self-worth and identity. And by extension - <strong>any doubt or wavering of self-confidence causes psychic trauma / cognitive dissonance when you attempt to attach dollars to your personal identity</strong></p>

<p>How can you solve this? Through a deliberately professional label.</p>

<p>Once you find a label that you are not terrified of then you can use that label as <strong>psychic armor to create emotional protection from the traumas of capitalism</strong>.</p>

<p>One has a vague sense of what rate feels too low, but almost anything above that seems too high.</p>

<p>You need a construct to do the charging <em>for you</em>.</p>

<p>This quote illustrates it really well (bolding mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At that point, I was charging $25-30 an hour and loved what I was doing, but soon realized that in my work, I‚Äôd often create systems that erased the job I was initially hired to do. <strong>That‚Äôs when I realized I could start calling myself a consultant. Owning the title ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù enabled a psychological shift in the way I thought about the work I was doing. This shift led me to increase my rate again</strong>, and eventually to articulate the skills I could offer new clients in the form of a program, complete with a business name, website, and set of rates. Before I articulated this ‚Äúbusiness offering‚Äù in a clear program, my annual revenue was around $40k. After making it clear exactly what I could offer potential clients, and by shifting my offerings based on what I saw clients finding most useful, my revenue jumped to $60k, then $85k, and last year (2018) it was $110k. (Remember, these numbers are revenue, not net profit.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from the excellent piece <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/on-what-it-takes-to-sustain-a-creative-life-financially/">On what it takes to sustain a creative life financially</a> by Sarah Schulweis.</p>

<p>This quote resonates with me because I went through the exact same journey - struggling to charge well for my time when I viewed myself as a freelancer or self-employed. Once I started using the word consultant (and started to actually believe it!) I felt more comfortable charging more for my work.</p>

<p>For me personally I think not in terms of Tom Critchlow sending you this invoice, but in terms of <em>my consulting business</em> sending you this invoice<sup id="fnref:yesand"><a href="#fn:yesand" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>How do you develop your own capitalist construct? It will vary from industry to industry. For me, it‚Äôs as simple as leaning on the word ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù. For others, creating a ‚Äústudio‚Äù branding might be the construct needed to charge well.</p>

<p>The worst thing to do is to let your personal identity be the thing that does the billing (regardless of whether it comes from ‚Äúyour name LLC‚Äù or not, don‚Äôt let your <strong>personal identity</strong> be the construct you use)<sup id="fnref:timemoney"><a href="#fn:timemoney" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p><span class="contributor">TS: Note that even within our professional construct, different situations call for different behaviors. It can be helpful to think of each of these as a micro-label: the me who deals with difficult client stakeholders; the me who can ask to raise my rates; the me who is good at networking; the me who can give a great sales pitch.</span></p>

<h2 id="the-question--the-identity-crisis">‚ÄúThe Question‚Äù &amp; the identity crisis</h2>

<p>Sooner or later when you‚Äôre independent a client will offer you a full time role.</p>

<p><em>Do you want to join the team full time?</em></p>

<p>I‚Äôve been faced with this question no fewer than 5 times in my consulting life and every single time it throws me for an emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<p>Talking to others I get the same sense - that even when it‚Äôs a company, a role or a salary that is unattractive full-time your mind can‚Äôt stop thinking about taking the role<sup id="fnref:fulltime"><a href="#fn:fulltime" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The reason this question is able to throw you for a loop is because it challenges your self-made identity. It directly confronts and questions your ability to stand behind the labels you‚Äôve chosen - by placing them in contrast to the ‚Äúauthoritative‚Äù and ‚Äúwell-understood‚Äù and ‚Äúrecognizable‚Äù label that they‚Äôre offering you.</p>

<p><span class="contributor">TS: The company has pierced directly through the psychic armour of your professional construct, and made a claim on your identity‚Äîthey are offering a direct challenge to your label structure, your perception of who you are.</span></p>

<p>There‚Äôs two ways to protect yourself from this emotional rollercoaster.</p>

<p>Firstly, Don‚Äôt let their label over-rule your label. You have a seat at the table - and they can‚Äôt take that away from you.</p>

<p><span class="contributor">TS: The client is offering to change its relationship with you, but don‚Äôt forget they still perceive you as a consultant to them. What you have is valuable enough for them to pay the premium rate of an independent consultant. Except for in senior executive roles, joining full time can in fact devalue your work as it becomes more accessible.</span></p>

<p>Secondly, remember that you can retain your identity as a consultant <em>and</em> take a full-time role. Offer to take the role but still bill through your LLC. While this option isn‚Äôt exactly viable for many situations it can help your perspective by thinking through this lens.</p>

<p>I remember a few years ago when my consulting work slowed down slightly and I took a job interview via a friend. I ended up with a job offer to become Creative Director<sup id="fnref:cd"><a href="#fn:cd" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> at a digital innovation studio. Despite  the fact that the salary they offered me was half what I earned that year, I almost took the job! I think it would have been a huge mistake but wow do those identity questions make you lose some sleep.</p>

<h2 id="poetry-over-power">Poetry over Power</h2>

<p>Many times titles and labels are a show of power. Some display of strength over others. <strong>I have this label</strong> is the same as saying <strong>I have this power</strong>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd encourage you to think of poetry instead of power. No one has claims on anyone else and part of the freedom of being independent is breaking free from some of those traditional power structures.</p>

<p>Use language and labels as a texture to provide as much psychological safety and identity as you need. If you feel less secure - choose labels that are well-understood. If you need to feel like an outsider - choose labels that are unique and unusual<sup id="fnref:weird"><a href="#fn:weird" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. If you want to be weird, be weird. You can hold a poetry over your own identity this way. Bewitching yourself is completely allowed.</p>

<p>From the book <em>Finite &amp; Infinite Games</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúTherefore, poets do not ‚Äòfit‚Äô into society, not because a place is denied them but because they do not take their ‚Äòplaces‚Äô seriously. They openly see its roles as theatrical, its styles as poses, its clothing costumes, its rules conventional, its crises arranged, its conflicts performed and its metaphysics ideological.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So play with labels, understand their power not over others but over ourselves. Understand their ability to provide an inner confidence and provide shelter in the capitalist storm.</p>

  <p><em>‚ÄúI read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I‚Äôve never been able to believe it. I don‚Äôt believe a rose WOULD be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.‚Äù ‚Äï L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The identity and labels you create for yourself as an independent consultant are tricky things. They‚Äôre not fixed but they sure do seem to carry some mystical weight. If we go around calling ourselves a UX designer one week and a storyteller in residence another week we‚Äôre going to suffer a kind of internal angst, or vertigo.</p>

<p>When you have a job - your work label is given to you. Anyone can go see it on your LinkedIn page. <em>‚ÄúProduct manager at Salesforce‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúHead of marketing at Etsy‚Äù</em>. These labels are very clearly defined - and they mean something - ‚Äúproduct manager‚Äù and ‚Äúhead of marketing‚Äù are legible and transferable between companies, they convey a shared sense of knowledge, expertise, seniority, salary and more.</p>

<p>But when you step out on your own‚Ä¶.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-01-09-14-38-55.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>LinkedIn doesn‚Äôt know what to do with you. Freelance strategy consultant employed by tomcritchlow.com‚Ä¶? Sure I guess?</p>

<p>You might think this is a surface level problem - haha ok so LinkedIn doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with me. No biggie - LinkedIn is garbage anyway right.</p>

<p>Except‚Ä¶ the power of labels isn‚Äôt for others, the power of labels is for ourselves.</p>

<p>Good labels give us the power to charge money, they give us confidence and energy. While bad labels can cause psychic anguish and self-sabotage.</p>

<p>When you step out on your own into the world of independence, you‚Äôre suddenly responsible for your own label. For the self employed indie consultant swapping out identities can be as easy as changing the words on LinkedIn or rewriting your landing page.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre simply not designed to switch our sense of identity so quickly or easily.</p>

<p>In part 1 we‚Äôll look at choosing the labels you use - dealing with the disorienting and uncomfortable questions about who you believe you are, who we want to become and how much you believe your own bullshit.</p>

<p>In part 2 we‚Äôll look at evolving and growing your sense of identity over time. Untethered from the world of pay rises, promotions and job titles, how do you create a sense of progress and personal growth?</p>

<h1 id="part-1-narrative-aircover">Part 1: Narrative Aircover</h1>

<p>A defining characteristic of the internet is to rewrite the rules of permission and institutions. This means that the way that identities are formed is changing too - how they are generated, shaped, validated and sustained all change because of the internet.</p>

<p>The old world is full of gatekeepers to impress - but the networked age radically changes the game. It changes who gets to give permission and which parts require permission at all. Now, in 2024, we‚Äôre firmly in an era of permissionless identities.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs no longer sufficient to rely on existing authority and institutions to create your labels - instead you need to create and tend to your own labels.</p>

<p>For independents you feel this acutely when you first step out on your own - how do you describe the work that you do? How do you describe who you are? But no matter the labels and language you choose, to begin with it‚Äôs going to be made up. You don‚Äôt yet have enough of a track record, client history or confidence in who you are or who you will become to state anything with certainty.</p>

<p>And in fact, this is a good thing! This leaping into the chaos of the unknown is one of the things that <strong><em>attracts</em></strong> weirdos, fools and generalists towards the independent lifestyle in the first place.</p>

<p>The first year or two of independent consulting are typically a swirling mixture of trying on labels for size. Are you a product manager? Consultant? Freelancer? Innovation designer? Copywriter? Strategist? Brand strategist? No-code guru?</p>

<p>These labels are going to swirl around you and I‚Äôm going to tell you that it‚Äôs ok to thrash around for a while - try labels on for size. Create new ones! Discard old ones! Come back to the ones you discarded before!</p>

<p>As Herminia Ibarra says in the wonderful book <a href="https://herminiaibarra.com/working-identity-book/">Working Identity</a>, the dangerous thing is to clutch too tightly to a singular introspective idea of ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù. Instead Herminia suggests we should adopt a more iterative, playful idea of ‚Äúwho could I become?‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúHow do we move forward and reinvent ourselves when our very selves have been so shaken? For starters, we must reframe the questions, abandoning the conventional career-advice queries‚Äî‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù‚Äîin favor of more open-ended alternatives‚Äî‚ÄúAmong the many possible selves that I might become, which is most intriguing to me now? Which is easiest to test?‚Äù Getting started depends on whether we are looking to find our one true self or whether, instead, we are trying to test and evaluate possible alternatives.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This process of becoming is entirely natural and in fact can be generative - leading to new ideas.</p>

<p>But this thrashing and cycling through labels can be psychologically exhausting too. For those around us - and for ourselves - how do we maintain some sense of stability in the chaos?</p>

<p>The answer is not to hide our consulting identity, but to protect it and give it some shelter while it‚Äôs still emerging. Enter narrative aircover.</p>

<h2 id="narrative-aircover">Narrative Aircover</h2>

<p>When I quit my last job almost 10 years ago, I didn‚Äôt know that I‚Äôd end up doing so much consulting work, or that I‚Äôd end up identifying so strongly with the label ‚Äúindependent consultant‚Äù.</p>

<p>It turns out when I quit my job I was actually trying to build an art startup with my partner: Fiercely Curious. You can see from this email exchange that <a href="https://www.fiercelycurious.com/">Fiercely Curious</a> is the primary label and identity I‚Äôm using:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-01-09-14-41-34.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It took about 9-12 months of juggling some consulting work and building an art startup to realize that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consulting pays far better than building an art startup (who knew!)</li>
  <li>I actually enjoyed consulting</li>
</ol>

<p>This was about the time that I decided to go ‚Äúall in‚Äù on consulting, to start using that label and identify that way. Importantly by that stage I‚Äôd had 4-5 solid consulting projects and had some confidence that ‚Äúconsultant‚Äù meant something more than just ‚Äúunemployed freelancer‚Äù.</p>

<p>This was all kind of accidental but in hindsight incredibly valuable - the ability to lean on Fiercely Curious as a project with some kind of substance allowed me to show up in the world, to have conversations with people, to network, to tell people what I was up to.</p>

<p>All while I muddled my way through becoming a consultant.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why I call this ‚Äúnarrative aircover‚Äù because it provides shelter and protection to the emerging identity while it‚Äôs still incredibly fragile.</p>

<p>In my case, my narrative aircover was in the shape of an art business. In your case it could be an online food magazine, or a meetup event series, or a podcast.</p>

<p>The key thing for narrative aircover is that it‚Äôs expansive, passionate and unblocked.</p>

<p>I think the following characteristics are most useful for narrative aircover to provide you value in the early stages of starting a consulting business:</p>

<h3 id="1-expansive-to-grow-your-surface-area">1. Expansive to grow your surface area</h3>

<p>While our consulting identity is small and fragile it can be easy to close up - to adopt a stance of safety. ‚ÄúWho am I to talk about being a consultant, I barely have any clients!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat do I have to say on LinkedIn, I‚Äôm not even working right now!‚Äù.</p>

<p>But growing and nurturing your network is essential to building a long term sustainable indie consulting career so in the early days it‚Äôs important to do things that open you up - open you up to opportunities, connections, conversations and clients. So you need to pick something that‚Äôs expansive - something that opens you up to invite connection.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: When Vicky Gu went out as an independent brand and content strategist - she leaned on narrative aircover of her online food magazine <a href="https://staycurrant.com/">Currant</a>. There, she is able to describe herself as a ‚Äúmanaging editor‚Äù (see how easy it is to award yourself labels in a permissionless world!).</p>

  <p>Currant is expansive - it is a way in for Vicky to have conversations with chefs, restaurant owners, writers, designers and all sorts of other folks in the making of a digital publication. But it‚Äôs also expansive in the sense that through sharing editorial pieces about food, she can reach new audiences.</p>
</div>

<p>The idea that your narrative aircover is something that can invite people to lean in allows you to easily have new conversations with new people and expand your surface area. Whether it‚Äôs an email list, event series or non-profit.</p>

<p>You want a project that opens doors - something that gives you an excuse to be public, visible and interesting. Building something that is a permission tool to give yourself permission to reach out to people, to meet people for coffee, to connect and to build your network.</p>

<h3 id="2-passionate-to-show-off-your-vibes">2. Passionate to show off your vibes</h3>

<p>As we saw in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/">Strange Attraction</a>, the value of your network comes from all kinds of weird and wonderful places - it isn‚Äôt always the people you would expect. And as we saw in <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/16/rejecting-specialization/">Rejecting Specialization</a> to secure senior level projects you need to expose your vibes.</p>

<p>So it‚Äôs important to have something <em>interesting</em> that you can talk about. My art startup is a great conversation starter - a lot of people are interested in art and culture. Just like lots of people are interested in Vicky‚Äôs food magazine.</p>

<p>Launching a narrative aircover project that is inherently aligned with your passions will help ensure that people are paying attention, leaning in and taking your meetings.</p>

<h3 id="3-unblocked-so-its-within-your-control">3. Unblocked so it‚Äôs within your control</h3>

<p>Finally, you want your narrative aircover project to be more under your own control than consulting work. One of the primary problems to solve is that you likely don‚Äôt currently have a lot of consulting work to rely on or talk about - you‚Äôre dependent on clients to move things forward.</p>

<p>So you want your narrative aircover project to be <strong>alive by default</strong> - not blocked and relying on others to move forward but something that you can move forward under your own steam. Even a humble blog can fit the requirements here - free to publish as and when you want without any kind of gatekeepers or dependencies on others.</p>

<p>In summary - indie consultants are creatures of momentum and narrative aircover is how you get started. It‚Äôs about creating activation energy in your network to start making something happen - because without that you‚Äôre going to just sit there and worry about finding clients.</p>

<p>Narrative aircover isn‚Äôt about hiding our consulting identity - it‚Äôs about not leaning on it too hard during the early days when it‚Äôs most fragile and still evolving.</p>

<p>Narrative aircover provides you meaning, labels, safety and permission to engage with people while you‚Äôre figuring things out during the first year or so of your journey.</p>

<h1 id="part-2-compound-narrative">Part 2: Compound Narrative</h1>

<p>Eventually, at some point down the road you will successfully manage to generate revenue, find clients and build a consulting practice that <em>works</em> - your next problem is figuring out how to make it sustainable.</p>

<p>Understandably - so much of your focus in the first few years of setting up your practice is on consistently generating clients. That is after all the most important thing you need. One client after another. Line em up.</p>

<p>But at some point you can end up stuck - feeling like every client is simply another spin of the hamster wheel. Trapped in your own constraints of client work you‚Äôre feeling like there‚Äôs a never-ending series of client projects on the treadmill. A feeling that every client is starting from zero again.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-01-09-14-57-47.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="tc f5 i">The never-ending treadmill of client work</div>

<p>One of the biggest downsides of consulting is that there‚Äôs nothing passive about the revenue - nothing compounds. To pay rent each month you have to keep generating clients.</p>

<p>This is why, once you reach some stability with consistently generating clients and revenue, many indie consultants begin to think about ‚Äúscaling themselves‚Äù - either in the form of hiring staff or in building ‚Äúpassive income‚Äù products.</p>

<p>This reflex isn‚Äôt bad per se but it‚Äôs important to recognize that they are avoiding the real problem. They are avoidance of dealing with the root issue of actually enjoying your consulting work. Of finding a way to value and enjoy client work over long periods of time.</p>

<p>Some of the things we‚Äôve talked about in the book can help you enjoy your work: shifting to strategic clients helps keep the work interesting and focusing on being impactful helps the work feel meaningful. But at some point it can start to feel like a grind.</p>

<p>The problem is that outside of the constraints and norms of full time work, a defined career and job progression - there‚Äôs no simple measure for professional advancement.</p>

<p>No one is paying for training, no one is sending you to conferences. No one is giving you a promotion or a new job title.</p>

<p>So you have to find your own personal growth plan - a way to both find intrinsic meaning in growth and development and in externally visible progress towards being ‚Äúmore senior‚Äù and able to move upwards inside client organizations. Otherwise you‚Äôll stagnate, your earnings will plateau and your public image will stall out.</p>

<h2 id="fitting-every-client-into-a-narrative-frame">Fitting every client into a narrative frame</h2>

<p>The trick here is to use each client as a compound build on the last one, not simply another go around the treadmill.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: In my own work - in year 2, after finding some routine in generating clients and steady work - a friend asked for advice on going out on their own, so I wrote up a blog post with some thoughts. That blog post generated a few more blog posts about the practice of independent consulting and before you know it I was writing this book (a project that would creatively sustain me with compound narrative for the next 6+ years!)</p>

  <p>The trick is that every new client isn‚Äôt simply a chance to do the same thing but it‚Äôs a chance to deepen my perspective and experience on the practice of independent consulting. Every client can teach you something.</p>

  <p>Now I gleefully look forward to new clients because I know they can become stories and examples for my book project.</p>
</div>

<p>I call this idea <strong>compound narrative</strong>. You need some way to feel like every client builds on the last one - that you‚Äôre left starting from somewhere new, not starting from the same place every time.</p>

<p>Then - the trick is to view every single client, no matter how ‚Äúboring‚Äù or ‚Äúroutine‚Äù or ‚Äústraightforward‚Äù on the surface - as being part of that compound narrative. What insights or evidence can you gather towards your questions through this client project?</p>

<p>Niko Canner calls this ‚Äú<a href="https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade">mastery of a larger game</a>‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The medium to do this larger work was in writing. In my prior chapter as a founder, building Katzenbach Partners, I‚Äôd never given myself much space to write, because that had never felt as important to my goals as the work of entrepreneurial leadership, rainmaking and advising clients. <strong>I needed to change that, and to recognize that writing would be my vehicle for reaching toward greater mastery of a larger game. Writing wasn‚Äôt in service of building an audience or building a business. Writing as a learning practice was an end in itself</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might seem straightforward but the subtle trick is choosing a narrative frame that you‚Äôre <strong><em>actually interested in</em></strong>. For example, if you‚Äôre a digital PR consultant - the obvious learning frame for your work would be to learn about the practice of digital PR. Sure, this makes sense - except perhaps you‚Äôre not really interested in the idea of ‚Äúdigital PR‚Äù - it‚Äôs too broad and doesn‚Äôt have any kind of hook to it.</p>

<p>The trick is to find a frame that lights up your curiosity - perhaps something like ‚Äúhow digital PR is evolving as new social platforms emerge‚Äù or ‚Äúhow companies measure the effectiveness of digital PR‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy digital PR doesn‚Äôt get a seat at the executive table‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-right-learning-questions">Finding the Right Learning Questions</h2>

<p>Notice that these narrative frames are all open ended questions that possess a measure of <strong>specific curiosity</strong>. These narrative frames can be far more interesting by virtue of being more specific.</p>

<p>Questions are powerful tools for shaping your thinking and perspective. Finding good questions can sustain and nourish your curiosity and help you feel alive. They‚Äôre the antidote to burnout and stagnation.</p>

<p>But how do you find good questions?</p>

<p>A great place to start is to write down a list of questions that you don‚Äôt know the answer to. Questions that might not even have an easy answer. Questions that you can explore over an extended period of time.</p>

<p>The community Huddlecraft calls these <a href="https://medium.com/huddlecraft/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904">learning questions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It‚Äôs important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‚Äòdesigned to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject‚Äôs own knowledge and/or feelings‚Äô. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.</p>

  <p>Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It‚Äôs more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.</p>

  <p>Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they have this lovely 2x2 framework with examples of learning questions:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-01-09-15-00-51.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This 2x2 framework feels right - if you write down 10 ideas for learning questions, you‚Äôll be able to plot them (subjectively) on this 2x2 graph. It‚Äôs not that every single learning question needs to be impossible to answer and open ended, but those questions are going to be the ones with the most potential to nourish and sustain your practice for the longest.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>Example: Behzod Sirjani is an independent consultant with a deep background in user research. To sustain his practice he has been researching and publishing OAE - a learning question around <a href="https://behzod.com/oae">organizations as ecosystems</a>:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>‚ÄúOrganizations as Ecosystems‚Äù is a research and writing project about the ways that organizations sense, react, learn, and change. Some outputs of this project will be regular essays and a corresponding set of readings and references.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is a perfect open ended and impossible to fully answer. It‚Äôs easy to see how this question could sustain years of client work, where each client is an opportunity to explore and deepen your understanding of the question of how companies sense, react, learn and change.</p>
</div>

<p>Finding the right set of learning questions is incredibly powerful because it turns your consulting practice into a sustainable practice. It enables you to stay in the work for long multi-year periods. Because you have to stay in the work - if you‚Äôre an independent consultant there‚Äôs no one to do the work for you - no employees, no colleagues to lean on. So you have to stay in the work.</p>

<h2 id="compound-thinking--publishing">Compound Thinking &amp; Publishing</h2>

<p>The magical thing about finding questions you‚Äôre interested in and pursuing them for a while is that you end up with interesting things to say.</p>

<p>As you deepen your understanding of the questions you‚Äôre interested in you find that these projects turn into generative and useful objects</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>For example, here‚Äôs John V Willshire back in 2015 talking about the famous ‚Äú<a href="https://smithery.com/2015/01/07/three-2015-projects/">Smithery Projects</a>‚Äù that he embarks on each year:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>‚ÄúAh, the famous annual Smithery projects. Well, famous might be pushing it, let‚Äôs go with ‚Äòthe thing that we do at the start of each year‚Äô. 2012 was about Making, 2013 was about Media, and 2014 was about Playing With Ideas, which in hindsight remained gloriously ill-defined but gave rise to August‚Äôs Culture Matrix malarkey, so we‚Äôll let it off.‚Äù</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>One of those projects eventually turned into a delightful foundational framework and approach called <a href="https://smithery.com/2020/12/01/starting-with-zenko-mapping/">Zenko mapping</a> that is core to how Smithery operates.</p>
</div>

<p>It‚Äôs part of why publishing is such a rich pursuit for indie consultants - it‚Äôs a culmination and focus on the act of <strong><em>accumulated insights</em></strong>. Turning your compound narrative into a published artefact is incredibly powerful - it positions you as an expert, builds an audience and is incredibly satisfying!</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a rich vein of self-publishing by indie consultants:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ux consultant writing <a href="https://4dthinking.studio/ux-book">a book about UX design</a>.</li>
  <li>The designer writing <a href="https://shapeofdesignbook.com/">a book about design</a>.</li>
  <li>The security consultant publishing <a href="https://www.spartan9.com/publications/crisis-simulations.html">emergency extraction guides</a>.</li>
  <li>The ethnographic researcher publishing <a href="https://www.thefieldstudyhandbook.com/">the fieldguide to ethnographic research</a>.</li>
  <li>The indie consultant publishing the book about independent consulting (coming soon!)</li>
</ul>

<p>But it doesn‚Äôt have to be a book - publishing in all its forms can be an email newsletter, it can be a podcast, it can be a zine, it can be a research report.</p>

<p>Any of these can work and in fact the ongoing nature of something like a podcast can help sustain an interest by becoming a vehicle not for promoting, but for learning! For <strong>continually being interested in the work you‚Äôre doing</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/compound-learning.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And if you do it all correctly, the sky‚Äôs the limit as April Dunford, author of Obviously Awesome, <a href="https://podcast.creatorscience.com/april-dunford/">will testify</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúGetting the book out was absolutely transformational to the business. Like, that‚Äôs what took me from, this is a good business that pays me more than what my salary was in house, you know, yay me, consultant, to holy man. I didn‚Äôt even think it was possible to make this kind of money and work with this kind of clients and do this amazing stuff. And, yeah, the book was a game changer.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>

<p>The challenge of managing your own identity - free from any constraints and expectations of full time work - can be a surprising challenge. Realizing that you can be whoever you want to be comes with a sense of being untethered. Navigating that narrative journey requires anchoring ourselves to things - whether it‚Äôs narrative aircover of a self-directed project or the compound narrative of learning questions.</p>

<p>And eventually, once you find a generative set of questions to explore, it can sustain an independent consulting practice for years - helping you generate interesting clients, enjoy every new client and build a sense of personal growth and progression.</p>
