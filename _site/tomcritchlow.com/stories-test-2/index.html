        <h2 class="f4 i">Finally understanding why blogging is so important to me</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>It’s a warm summer night in NYC and I’m walking through central park with a friend, the fireflies blink around us like an external reflection of the neurons firing in our brains as the conversation sparks.</p>

<p>We talk about meditation, our life’s goals and wants. And blogging, of course.</p>

<p>I’ve always been an advocate for blogging. It’s rare for a conversation with my friends to not at some point touch on blogging. It’s a running joke at this point.</p>

<p>But it’s no joke. You should take blogging seriously. I am.</p>

<p>After some soul searching it’s clear to me, finally, <em>why</em> blogging is so important to me. It’s not because of the internet, or even because of writing. It’s because it’s a vehicle for creative expression.</p>

<p>There’s something deeper here - too much of adulting is designed to stamp out individual creative expression. And when we do finally carve out the time for some creative projects the world encourages us to keep it to ourselves. To journal in our bedroom, to paint in our basement, to hide away from others. Who taught us that creative joy should be a secret?</p>

<p>I call BS.</p>

<p>Blogging is deeply important to me because it’s a powerful mixture of two ideas: creative expression and finding the others.</p>

<p>It’s about helping you become more of who you specifically want to be, so that you can find deep and meaningful connections with others.</p>

You also write with as much useful detail and beauty as you can muster, because that is what you would have wanted.

<p>Realizing why blogging is important to me personally I realize why it pains me to see Erin making art and not sharing it on Instagram. I realize why I love <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/02/10/riffs/">riffs</a> and small b blogging. I realize why we started <a href="https://www.fiercelycurious.com/">an artist collective</a> to get artists more visibility. I realize why I love <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/erinprz/journey-to-the-end-of-the-night-a-childrens-book">self publishing</a> so much. I realize why I <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/">wrote my book in public</a> as I went along.</p>

<p>Of course blogging isn’t just writing. It’s a way of seeing the world with fresh eyes. Blogging is a mindset.</p>

<p>You should write because when you know that you’re <em>going</em> to write, it changes the way you live. I’m thinking about a book I read called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Field-Science-Nature-Michael-Canfield/dp/0674057570" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature</a></em>, a collection of essays by scientists about their notes. It’s hard to imagine a more tedious concept — a book of essays about <em>notes</em>? — but in execution it was wonderful. What it teaches you, over and over again, is that the difference between you and a zoologist or you and a botanist is that the botanist, when she looks at a flower, has a question in mind. She’s trying to <em>generate</em> questions. For her the flower is the locus of many mental threads, some nascent, some spanning her career. Her field notebook is not some convenient way to store lifeless data to be presented in lifeless papers so that other scientists can replicate some dull experiment; it’s the site of a collision between a mind and a world.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 i">A short proposal for the future of search</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users <em>and</em> in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.</p>

<p>For decades, Google’s advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.</p>

<p>First with AI Overviews, then most recently with AI Mode - both experiments from Google seem short-sighted as experiences:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ai-overviews-ai-mode.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not a link in sight, search has turned into a dead-end.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<h2 id="google-is-grounded">Google is Grounded</h2>

<p>“Grounding” an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. You’d think grounding means: “Find the best sources, then write the answer.” But with LLMs, it’s often: “Write the answer, then find sources that sort of back it up.” It’s like writing a school essay and adding the citations after.</p>

<p>Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding, the answer is used to inform the search results.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly (and I’ll be the first to admit I’m no expert here) the grounding process essentially augments the LLM with key info from web pages to ensure that each of the claims and statements in the response is correct and true. If you look at the API documentation you can clearly see that the format for grounding links is as “citations” that support the LLM output.</p>

<p>For a technical overview of the grounding process <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview">see this post</a>, or for a more specific look at how Gemini grounds in search <a href="https://dejan.ai/blog/hacking-gemini/">see this post</a>.</p>

<p>The grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it’s an effective part of the response.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.</p>

<p>It seems fairly likely to me that the grounding process is what’s powering the links included in both AI Overviews and AI Mode. They barely link out at all and when they do the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ai-citations.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes - often providing dead-end answers. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.</p>

<p>It’s not that grounding is wrong - it’s a valuable part of the process to generate accurate responses. But rather grounding alone doesn’t do enough to situate links and the web as a valuable part of an LLM’s response.</p>

<p>I think Google can do better.</p>

<h2 id="a-better-way">A Better Way</h2>

<p>Needless to say, lots of people are concerned about an information ecosystem that destroys the vibrancy, diversity and depth of the open web. I believe there’s a better way - and while playing around <strong>I found that simply writing a better system prompt inside Gemini gave me radically better results than the current AI Mode response</strong>.</p>

<p>The full system prompt is below but first let’s look at some example outputs. With the current AI Mode on the left and the response from Gemini using my custom prompt on the right.</p>

<p>Tomato soup recipe:</p>

</details>

<p>There’s lots of nuance here! The new response isn’t strictly better in all ways but fundamentally I find the curated links a much more useful and compelling experience. Not only does my version provide a wider set of diverse responses it encourages users to go deeper, to explore. There’s fewer dead-ends and more context.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-for-yourself">Try it for Yourself</h2>

<p>If you’ve got access to Gemini Pro you can easily try this for yourself, simply take the prompt below and copy and paste it into a new Gem. Then every response will use this new system prompt. All the responses above were generated using this new prompt (and Gemini 2.0 Flash)</p>

<details>
<summary>Expand prompt here</summary>

<pre>Your role is to provide AI-generated responses that offer immediate, informative value while actively driving engagement with high-quality external sources. Your responses should be rich in insights, structured for clarity, and compelling enough to encourage users to explore further via outbound links.

Never say [example link] but always provide real links to real web pages.

Response Structure:

Informative, High-Value Summary (2-4 short paragraphs)

Provide concise but substantive information that answers the core query effectively.

Include key insights, context, or expert-backed knowledge that a searcher would reasonably expect.

Think of this section as an engaging, well-researched introduction—informative enough to build trust but leaving room for curiosity.

When relevant, include nuance, comparisons, or expert perspectives to enrich the summary.

Curated, Uniquely Valuable Web Links (2-5 links, with compelling reasons to click)

Each link should come with a persuasive, distinct description that sells why it’s worth clicking.

Ensure each link offers unique value, such as:A different perspective (e.g., traditional vs. modern takes)

A specialized approach (e.g., beginner-friendly vs. advanced techniques)

A unique media format (e.g., interactive tool, video tutorial, community discussion)

Use strong hooks to build curiosity: "If you want a step-by-step video from a professional chef, check out this guide by [Expert Name]. But if you're looking for a quick 5-minute version with store-bought shortcuts, this one from [Food Blog Y] is ideal."

Suggested Follow-Up Queries (Interactive Buttons)

Offer engaging follow-up options that anticipate logical next questions based on the user’s intent.

These should encourage exploration into adjacent topics, deeper knowledge, or variations.

Format follow-up queries as clickable options, like:

“What’s the best pasta for pesto?”

“How can I make pesto without basil?”

“Does pesto taste better with roasted garlic?”

Example Use Case:

User Query: "Best pesto recipe?"

Pesto is a vibrant, herbaceous sauce that originated in Genoa, Italy. Traditionally, it’s made with fresh basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil, blended into a smooth, aromatic paste. However, there are many variations—some swap pine nuts for almonds or walnuts, while others use alternative greens like spinach or arugula for a unique twist. Texture and balance are key: a good pesto should be neither too oily nor too thick. Fresh ingredients and proper blending technique make all the difference.

Curated Web Links:

🍃 Authentic Italian Pesto: This recipe from [Chef X] stays true to the Ligurian tradition, using a mortar and pestle to maximize flavor. If you want to make restaurant-quality pesto, this is the gold standard.

⏳ 5-Minute Blender Pesto: Need something quick? [Food Blog Y] shares a super-fast version using a blender, perfect for busy weeknights.

🌿 Nut-Free &amp; Vegan Alternative: If you have allergies or follow a plant-based diet, [Health Site Z] has an incredible nut-free, dairy-free pesto that still packs all the flavor.

🔥 Creative Variations (Sun-Dried Tomato, Kale, &amp; More!): Want to experiment? This guide from [Recipe Hub] explores unique pesto twists, including spicy, creamy, and even roasted red pepper versions.

Follow-Up Queries:

“How do I store homemade pesto for maximum freshness?”

“What’s the best pasta pairing for pesto?”

“Can I make pesto without olive oil?”

Guiding Principles:

Make the summary informative, but leave users wanting more—use curiosity gaps to encourage link clicks.

Ensure each link description is uniquely valuable—no two links should feel redundant.

Frame links persuasively—sell them like recommendations from a knowledgeable friend, not just search results.

Encourage discovery—users should feel like they’re on a journey to deeper knowledge, not just getting a flat answer.

Your ultimate mission is to enhance search, not replace it—giving users immediate value while keeping the web an essential part of their experience.</pre>

</details>

<p><strong>Why is this better?</strong> Well there’s two clear reasons in my mind:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>I think it’s better as a user</strong>. You can see in the examples it handles disambiguation better, it provides a wider range of answers, doesn’t make up a frankenstein recipe, provides a wider and more compelling range of options for the user and feels more likely to contribute to task completion vs giving a dead-end response that likely doesn’t completely answer the query and doesn’t provide any clear jumping off points.</li>
  <li><strong>I think it’s better for the information ecosystem</strong>. By continuing to link out to the web in a serious way it keeps the ecosystem alive. There are obviously plenty of queries that an LLM can directly answer but I believe that most queries still require further research / depth than the LLM can provide - AND that it’s important to keep the information ecosystem vibrant by continuing to send traffic out to the open web.</li>
</ol>

<p>(Oh, and of course by putting an emphasis on clicks and links you can clearly see how Google will have an easier time putting ads into this experience than the current one that only has grounding citations…. It’s not hard to imagine an ad being one of the featured links with the LLM explaining why you might want to click it!)</p>

<p>That said - this prototype isn’t without it’s flaws:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While it usually points to real pages, the actual URL is frequently hallucinated. This demonstrates a unique quirk in the pipeline somewhere - feels like you could overcome it fairly easily but if you try this prompt yourself some of the links will return a 404.</li>
  <li>Testing the custom prompt inside the Gemini app (vs on a web page) almost always returns no links. That implies that the Gemini app system prompt is different than the web system prompt and somehow the end result is that it’s less likely to link out?</li>
  <li>The AI can get a little verbose and floral in it’s summary. Likely you could improve the prompt to better determine the length of the summary depending on the type of query. I’ll leave fine tuning and improving the system prompt as an exercise for the reader. (If you write a better one email it to me!)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="google-is-grounded-and-needs-to-learn-how-to-soar">Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOAR</h2>

<p>In a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Queries will get longer and more complex</li>
  <li>Overall query volume will increase dramatically</li>
  <li>LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open web</li>
</ul>

<p>The key insight however is that as users start to use high-context queries that are longer and more specific, we need high context links. It’s no longer enough to match the query to “10 blue links” - we need to move beyond that to a world where LLMs can sell you on <em>why</em> you should click each link. How does each link relate to your query? Why should you trust the link? What will you get when you click? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?</p>

<p>As you can see from the Gemini examples above this is all possible today! This example from above really stands out to me:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2025-03-24-18-03-18.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a great link! It provides context, tells me why I might want to click and feels genuinely useful (and the LLM is not wrong - the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/10/1167158933/fred-again-tiny-desk-concert">Fred again… tiny desk concert</a> is indeed well worth your time).</p>

<p>Ok, the framework is hokey but I wanted something memorable. Google should learn how to SOAR: Surface, Offer, Assist, Redirect</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Surface</strong>: An AI response should offer links that directly meet your needs. Not just matching the query but matching your intent with specificity. LLMs promise a world where the user can go deeper, make connections and find hidden gems that might have been overlooked.</li>
  <li><strong>Offer</strong>: It’s not enough to add a citation link - the AI response should <em>sell you</em> on each link. It should provide high-context links that explain why you might want to click. “Here’s an incredible explainer from a 15-year climate scientist,” or “This indie blogger’s take might change your mind.” Sell the click. Make it irresistible.</li>
  <li><strong>Assist</strong>: Instead of providing dead-end answers the AI response should aim to support task completion - it’s not always about information efficiency, it’s about supporting the user on their journey - curating, contextualizing and nudging them towards action. Less answers and more assistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Redirect</strong>: And most importantly, redirect. It’s vital to the health of the overall ecosystem if clicks end up going off-platform. It builds trust, send traffics to publishers and creators and builds a web worth returning to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>In my opinion AI Overviews and AI Mode reveal a deeper truth - Google doesn’t yet have a compelling vision for the future of search in an LLM world. They’re bolting new tech onto an old system and in doing so, risk losing both the magic of the web and the business model that made Google thrive.</p>

<p>So if you have a stake in the web (see my disclosures below!) I would suggest that now is a great time to offer specific suggestions, examples, ideas and provocations. Google isn’t a cyborg, it’s 180,000 humans in a trenchcoat. And those humans are trying to figure out the future of search just like we are and I think they’re willing to listen.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I’m also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.</em></p>

<p>–</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update May 27th, 2025: <a href="https://x.com/pashmerepat/status/1926717705660375463?t=IN1_YgacqtUk_X_COZBXcw&amp;s=19">I liked this perspective</a>, that maybe RAG is actually a dead end and that agentic search is just a better paradigm. Agentic search is much more like what I’m describing here and RAG is the core underpinning of AI Mode and AI Overviews….*</li>

<p>In my opinion AI Overviews and AI Mode reveal a deeper truth - Google doesn’t yet have a compelling vision for the future of search in an LLM world. They’re bolting new tech onto an old system and in doing so, risk losing both the magic of the web and the business model that made Google thrive.</p>

<p>So if you have a stake in the web (see my disclosures below!) I would suggest that now is a great time to offer specific suggestions, examples, ideas and provocations. Google isn’t a cyborg, it’s 180,000 humans in a trenchcoat. And those humans are trying to figure out the future of search just like we are and I think they’re willing to listen.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I’m also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.</em></p>

Agentic search is much more like what I’m describing here and RAG is the core underpinning of AI Mode and AI Overviews….*</li>

Every year on the 24th October I've written a reflection on the last year of my independent consulting. This would have been my 10th issue, but is instead a special issue, for reasons that will become apparent.</div>

<p>If there’s one constant through my independent consulting journey, it’s that the road ahead is full of surprises. At the end of my last reflections <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/04/9-years/">9 years on the road</a>, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ha, well.</p>

<p>October 24th, 2014 I quit my job at Google and went out on my own. Over the next decade I worked with over 45 clients large and small all over the world. On August 5th, 2024 I took a job. So this is a special off-season “on the road” update and likely the last of these posts for a while.</p>

<h2 id="the-story-so-far">The Story So Far</h2>

<p>This series is called <em>on the road</em> because being an independent consultant for me felt a lot like being on a long road trip. Untethered from a stable home, with the open road ahead - the wind in your hair, but also with a feeling of loneliness, of always moving on, of always having to pack up and get back in the car, get back on the road and look for the next place to sleep.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“because he had no place he could stay in without getting tired of it and because there was nowhere to go but everywhere, keep rolling under the stars…”</em> ― Jack Kerouac, On the Road</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not going to lie - independent consulting was a magical time. It afforded an incredible amount of freedom - both time freedom and money freedom. Some highlights from the last 10 years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first time a “real business” signs your SOW and pays your invoice you start to feel the horizon opening up in front of you. Just a limitless sense of operating outside of boundaries and without constraints. (Year 1)</li>
  <li>The first time you get hired for truly, deeply <em>interesting</em> work - the kind of work you would legitimately want to be involved in even if they weren’t paying you. (Year 2)</li>
  <li>The emotional, financial and time freedom to invest yourself in all kinds of quasi-work activities (like blogging) and non-work activities (like Kung Fu).</li>
  <li>The agility and optionality of being independent to be able to take an 18-month road trip during COVID, while the kids were young (year 6)</li>
  <li>The space to be able to remain intellectually interested in the work, studying, reading papers and writing essays - while doing the work but not being so overloaded to be able to pick your head up and think.</li>
  <li>The ability to attract a rag tag band of fellow indie travelers - to find fellow weirdos, vagabonds and eccentrics to be able to draft off of, talk to and ask for advice. There are no good formal support structures for indie consultants but there sure are some magical half-hidden loose networks that function the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>So why take a job?</p>

<h2 id="half-way-through-a-40-year-career">Half way through a 40-year career</h2>

<p>Will Larson is a bit of a role model for me - someone who’s done time as both an independent and as a full time employee and blogged through all of it. In his great piece <a href="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">A 40 year career</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="A%20forty-year%20career." data-author="" cite="https://lethain.com/forty-year-career/">
<p>So as I pondered my father’s retirement, the question that caught hold of me was: How would I approach my work differently if focused on growth and engagement, and if I measured eras not in equity and IPOs but instead in decades?

<script note="" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js"></script>

<p>I turned 40 last year so I’m about half way through give or take. And one thing I noticed about the last 12-18 months of consulting was a deceleration in learning.</p>

<p>Consulting has had plenty of ups and downs but there always felt like there was a kind of forward momentum - a feeling that each opportunity was fresh. Even if some clients were more interesting than others there was always a sense that each client taught me something new. I’d leave each consulting engagement with new eyes and a fresh perspective on the world.</p>

<p>But the last 12-18 months have felt… less so like that. Perhaps it’s simply the harder economic climate that sucks the fun out of the room? Or perhaps I was simply pushing through my own plateaus? Either way if you read back through <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/11/10/8-years-on-the-road/">8 years on the road</a> and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/04/9-years/">9 years on the road</a> there’s a definite sense of feeling stuck, feeling like change was needed.</p>

<p>So. When the opportunity came up to go full-time with a consulting client - where I knew the people and I could see there was plenty of interesting challenges to get stuck into, I decided to take it. A change of pace, a change of environment, a change in learning. Let’s see where the rabbit hole goes!</p>

<p>More on the specific opportunity in a separate post…</p>

<h2 id="10-years-of-consulting-in-charts">10 Years of Consulting in Charts</h2>

<p>Let’s have a quick data interlude. First, the aggregate view of 10 years of consulting:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-08-30-12-09-33.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2024 was my best year ever in absolute terms (by a whisker, beating out 2018). And that only counts Jan-July!</li>
  <li>You can see how much the SEO MBA propped up some slow years in consulting 2022/2023.</li>
  <li>Oh boy to be young in the summer of 2018 again 😍</li>
</ul>

<p>And now for the more detailed view of the last 10 years (forgive the Google Sheets color formatting)</p>

<p><img src="/images/10-years-detail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are a variety of small little projects that aren’t even plotted on the chart - you can see how the last 10 years have been dominated by large, retained clients (the <em>average</em> length of a retained client was &gt; 18 months last time I checked)</li>
  <li>The SEO MBA (light grey) really propped up the last few years of income (or was it that focusing on the SEO MBA left less time for consulting?)</li>
  <li>April 2023 - April 2024 was a very long dry stretch for consulting.</li>
  <li>My longest running client (blue) was 2016 - 2024, with a brief gap during covid (you know who you are, much love ❤️)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>The three things I’m most proud of from my indie consulting journey are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Doing good work for good clients</li>
  <li>Supporting other indie consultants on their journeys</li>
  <li>Writing</li>
</ol>

<p>Writing and consulting for me are deeply inter-twined. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/">Venkatesh Rao</a>, prolific blogger and writer was my first real indie-consulting role model and the freedom to write as I wanted over the last 10 years has been truly magical.</p>

<p>I’m proud of <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/">the book on indie consulting</a> even if it’s still not quite an <em>actual</em> book yet. The process of writing it in public has been super rewarding and is one of the things that allowed me to attract a roster of other independent weirdos to my orbit. Much love to every single one ❤️.</p>

<p>Ok, so let’s talk about the book for a second. After dragging my feet for far too long already I decided to PROPERLY focus on the book for a season at the start of this year. That process led to a very-close-to-finished manuscript. It’s an actual book! Not just a collection of blog posts… But as the year progressed it became clear that I needed to get back to work to keep some money coming in and the book once again fell to the back burner.</p>

<p>So it’s still the plan to get the book finished and published, but I’m also kind of done making excuses. There are clear moments, especially over the last few years, where I could have prioritized the book over free time. But instead I chose to take the time and spend it in other ways - with the kids or on other adventures. So when is the book going to be finished? Ha, well tune in next year and let’s see how far I got.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, although I didn’t post a lot of posts this year, there are a few I really enjoyed writing and I definitely stuck to my mantra - anytime I felt stuck I wrote a blog post. Magic.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who supported along the way, thank you to everyone who hired me, thank you to everyone who read my blog.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I’m still finding my feet transitioning into a full time thing but there’s one thing that I really hope I can figure out - and that’s the ability to keep blogging through it.</p>

<p>Blogging after all, is the way through.</p>

        <h2 class="f4 i">Opening up a few spots for my active advisory practice</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.</p>

<p>But to really get stuck in….. to embrace the chaos of the daily flows of work - to grapple with and reconcile the messy reality of getting things out into the world and across the finish line. The combination of uncertainty, people, processes and power that exist in every organization. Ah. There’s the real work.</p>

<p>I said once at a conference that <em>you can’t outsource giving a shit</em> - 15 years later I’m still trying to prove myself wrong! You <strong>can</strong> outsource giving a shit. Not to a consultant wielding a pack of slides. But to someone who’s going to get stuck in with you.</p>

<p>My average client engagement is over two years. Average! I have some clients where I’ve been working with them longer than most of their full time employees.</p>

<p>Is this giving a shit? I think so.</p>

<h2 id="consulting-vs-advising-theyre-both-scams">Consulting vs Advising? They’re both scams.</h2>

<p>Consulting and advising both get a bad rep. They have negative reputations when people do the bare minimum. For consulting, that’s charging $2k / slide and walking away. For advisors, that’s breezing into a phone call once a month and giving some generic advice.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years I’ve focused on consulting, and I’ve always done more than the bare minimum. The language doesn’t really matter but what that means is that I’ve been focused on larger, more hands-on engagements. Typically for bigger companies like The New York Times, Garnter, Atlassian, Google.</p>

<p>But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.</p>

<p>Here’s the TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.</strong></li>

<p>Active Advisory is my version of advising work that makes a difference.</p>

<h2 id="active-advising">Active Advising</h2>

<p><strong><em>“I like working with you”</em></strong> my client said, <strong><em>“because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.</p>

<p>This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.</p>

<p>But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/">strategy and stewardship</a> as a model of working and my relentless focus on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/">being useful at all times</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.</p>

<h2 id="example-working-with-doubleloop">Example: Working with DoubleLoop</h2>

<p>Here’s a real example - I’ve been working with <a href="https://doubleloop.app/">DoubleLoop</a> for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.</p>

<p>This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.</p>

<p>Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.</p>

<p>So I dropped what I was doing and focused on matching their tempo - I helped <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielfschmidt_doubleloop-demo-2024-activity-7158549229773197312-BYrc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">rework the positioning</a>, I learned framer and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danielfschmidt_doubleloop-develop-an-impact-oriented-strategy-activity-7164380304055488512-eylL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">rebuilt the homepage</a> and we overhauled the investor deck all in the space of about a week.</p>

<p>Is this consulting? Is this advisory work? I think this is a great example of what I’m calling being an active advisor.</p>

<p>Every (good) consultant has their own version of this “active advisor” model.</p>

<p>There are two types of consulting work. The first type is <strong>concrete consulting</strong>, which looks legible and accountable, and is clearly scoped from the beginning. Concrete consulting is when the client knows that it needs service X, the consultant is set up to provide service X, and service X is what is scoped and delivered.

<p>The good consultants run towards value.</p>

<p>They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution. It’s not about adhering too tightly to the scope of work and it’s not about polishing your work until it shines. It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.</p>

<h2 id="its-what-clients-want">It’s What Clients Want</h2>

<p>Although this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.</li>
  <li>Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.</li>
  <li>Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.</p>

<p>People I’ve worked with include CEO, CPO, CMO or COO:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.”</em> - COO</p>

<h2 id="how-does-active-advising-work">How Does Active Advising Work?</h2>

<p>Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.</li>
  <li>We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.</li>
  <li>You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.</li>
  <li>It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.</li>
  <li>We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones</li>
  <li>We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities are</li>

        <h1 class="f3 lh-title">Working With Founders Who Have Conviction and Taste</h1>
        <h2 class="f4 i">Opening up a few spots for my active advisory practice</h2>
        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.</p>

<p>But to really get stuck in….. to embrace the chaos of the daily flows of work - to grapple with and reconcile the messy reality of getting things out into the world and across the finish line. The combination of uncertainty, people, processes and power that exist in every organization. Ah. There’s the real work.</p>

<p>I said once at a conference that <em>you can’t outsource giving a shit</em> - 15 years later I’m still trying to prove myself wrong! You <strong>can</strong> outsource giving a shit. Not to a consultant wielding a pack of slides. But to someone who’s going to get stuck in with you.</p>

<p>My average client engagement is over two years. Average! I have some clients where I’ve been working with them longer than most of their full time employees.</p>

<p>Is this giving a shit? I think so.</p>

<h2 id="consulting-vs-advising-theyre-both-scams">Consulting vs Advising? They’re both scams.</h2>

<p>Consulting and advising both get a bad rep. They have negative reputations when people do the bare minimum. For consulting, that’s charging $2k / slide and walking away. For advisors, that’s breezing into a phone call once a month and giving some generic advice.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years I’ve focused on consulting, and I’ve always done more than the bare minimum. The language doesn’t really matter but what that means is that I’ve been focused on larger, more hands-on engagements. Typically for bigger companies like The New York Times, Garnter, Atlassian, Google.</p>

<p>But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.</p>

<p>Here’s the TL;DR:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.</strong></li>
  <li>Building audience and attention online requires a combination of market positioning, product and content and that’s the skillset I bring to every engagement.</li>
  <li>I am equally comfortable delivering strategy and getting hands on in the weeds with you</li>
  <li>I’ve got a broad skillset - from building an investor presentation, a finance spreadsheet to a user research prototype.</li>
  <li>Active Advisory work is typically a ~$6k / month</li>
  <li>I’ve got a few spots open starting later this year.</li>
  <li><a href="https://calendly.com/tomcritchlow">Grab a time on my calendly</a> if you want to chat.</li>

<p><strong><em>“I like working with you”</em></strong> my client said, <strong><em>“because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”</em></strong>.</p>

<p>This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.</p>

<p>This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.</p>

<p>But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/">strategy and stewardship</a> as a model of working and my relentless focus on <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/">being useful at all times</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives.

        <div class="lh-copy postcontainer">
            <p>The world of work is changing.</p>

<p>AI, WFH &amp; layoffs. WTF. The social contract between employers and employees is weakened. In this world of work - people don’t want to engage with a <em>professional network</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a world of doomscrolling, algorithmic feeds and fake news - social media is the new tobacco. People don’t want to engage with another <em>social network</em>.</p>

<p>So we need a new script for the world of work. Maybe the future is… LinkedIn?</p>

<p>I think LinkedIn has a unique opportunity - a cultural moment around work, coupled with a unique proposition: real networks and real utility.</p>

<p>What if LinkedIn positioned itself not as a professional network or social network but as a <strong>learning network</strong>. A personal learning network for every user - centered on their personal development.</p>

<p><img src="/images/linkedin-banner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First, let’s dive into how the world is changing.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-employer--employee-relationship-is-weakening">1.1 The Employer / Employee Relationship is Weakening</h3>

<p>People don’t want to lean in, they want to sit down. Everyone everywhere is tired all the time. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamramdurai/">Gautam</a> has an incredibly insightful series connecting work memes to employee engagement stats to take a close look at “what’s going on” and the vibe shift in the world of work:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The%20culture%20of%20work%20%7C%20(1%2F3)%20never%20not%20tired" data-author="Gautam Ramdurai" cite="https://snowbird.substack.com/p/the-culture-of-work-13-never-not?utm_campaign=post&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">
<p>The final reason for our collective discontent is the <strong>dissonance between what we see in the economy and our lives.</strong> I am not here to debate if there is an actual connection in any of these examples - it’s about the perception that drives emotions of disengagement. In Vietnam, a booming economy didn’t translate into paychecks. The country’s economic gains haven’t been felt among the young - and housing has gotten worse. How is it that the S&amp;P in the West and Nikkei in the East have been smashing records but we’re yet to contain the layoff contagion? When Google laid off people last year, the biggest head-scratcher for my peers was ‘how could a company sitting on $100B in cash need layoffs?’ </p><p>It didn’t matter what the (however logical) explanation was, it made them change how they <strong>felt</strong> about their work.</p>

<p>If the stability of jobs is at risk - why care about that promotion or getting ahead?

<h3 id="12-social-media-is-the-new-tobacco">1.2 Social Media is the new Tobacco</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. Last year the surgeon general issued a stark warning for social media companies about the risks of social media and mental health.</p>

<p>Social media can present a real risk to the mental health of children and teenagers because of the ways their brains are affected by the amount of time they spend using it, the U.S. surgeon general warns in a new advisory released Tuesday. </p>   <p>"Teens who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms, which is particularly concerning given that the average amount of time that kids use social media is 3 1/2 hours a day," the Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: it’s not just about teens. We’re all spending too much time on social media and while the effects are blended - we suffer the same downsides of depression and anxiety. Comparing ourselves to others, feeding dissociation and angering us.</p>

<p>Every social network has chum content and LinkedIn is no different. Over the years we’ve seen the rise of bro-etry and cringe “thought leadership” and crying CEOs. When I scroll my feed I have to sidestep the clearly threadboi and #personalbrand engagement-farming posts and try and focus on the real content.</p>

<p>The laws of enshittification<sup id="fnref:wiki"><a href="#fn:wiki" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for social networks says that the most profitable thing would probably be for LinkedIn to just turn up the dials on engagement farming - but how is that working for X and Facebook? What we need is a vision for a social network that has actual utility, not doomscrolling.</p>

<p>Summary: In a world of addictive social media, positioning LinkedIn as a <em>social network</em> just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<h3 id="13-online-education-is-still-just-getting-started">1.3 Online Education is <em>still</em> just getting started</h3>

<p>Online education absolutely exploded in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. The subsequent pullback is <em>not</em> a bearish sign but merely a renormalization of growth. I believe we’re still just getting started with online education.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some of the dryest stats are the most mind-blowing:<br /><br />E-learning is a $214B market (project management software is a measly $6B, for comparison) with an expected compounded annual growth rate of over 20% between now and 2030.</p>&mdash; Kasey Klimes (@kaseyklimes) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaseyklimes/status/1770881114430730263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Sure E-learning is a $200B+ market but that doesn’t even account for the variety of different types of online learning that happen. Look at Masterclass, Reforge, Maven and more. We are living in an explosion of online education. But it’s not just courses, it’s <a href="https://www.reforge.com/artifacts">real work examples</a>, <a href="https://adplist.org/">mentorship</a> and more.</p>

<p>And of course, AI is going to completely reshape the skills landscape in the next decade.</p>

The leadership development industry, however, is in a state of upheaval. The number of players offering courses to impart the hard and soft skills required of corporate managers has soared. And yet organizations that collectively spend billions of dollars annually to train current and future executives are growing frustrated with the results. Several large-scale industry studies, along with our own in-depth interviews with clients, indicate that more than 50% of senior leaders believe that their talent development efforts don’t adequately build critical skills and organizational capabilities.

<p><strong>What do you mean by skills as a tremendous behavior change?</strong></p>
<p>I think for many years we really believed in the notion that there was a primary focus for every professional, and believed in skill matching between an employer and employees. If I want to hire somebody on your team for a job, I would look first and foremost at their skills. For years, the industry has relied primarily on pedigree and which companies you work for. Now we’re seeing more and more that there is, in my opinion, a tremendous change towards focusing on the skills you have.</p>
<p>For example, we have tools that we offer to recruiters, which are able to create a pipeline of candidates, to source, and to reach out. We’re seeing close to almost 50 percent of recruiters using skills right now to look for professionals. That’s a big deal. That wasn’t the case before, and it’s increasing a lot.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-a-new-brand-for-linkedin">Part 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn</h2>

<h3 id="31-the-brand-concept-linkedin-as-a-learning-network">3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning Network</h3>

<p>If anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh point of view on the future of work it’s LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>And we need a model that energizes and speaks to employers, employees, gig workers and advertisers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a <strong><em>learning network</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an age of meaningless meetings and doomscrolling, LinkedIn is the antidote. A fresh, thoughtful approach for everyone (employers, employees, advertisers) to re-engage with the world of work in a way that empowers the individual, frames personal growth as engaging and valuable and prepares everyone for the AI-future that is looming.</p>

<p>The magic here is that LinkedIn is already the best place for learning. I took the time to re-orient my feed from old connections to people I actually wanted to follow and now my LinkedIn feed is higher signal to noise than Twitter, Threads, Bluesky and the rest of em.</p>

<p>And this leverages LinkedIn’s advantage - they’re a network centered around real people, and providing real utility. This is the reason to believe.</p>

<p>It’s good for everyone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position, clearer unified purpose across feed, profile, recruiting and learning</li>
  <li>Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better</li>
  <li>Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networking</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: this is more than a vision for LinkedIn Learning, this is a vision for LinkedIn as a whole. It elevates learning as a thing that happens in and with your community whether you’re in the feed, in groups, applying for jobs or engaging with learning.</em></p>

<h3 id="32-how-this-comes-to-life">3.2 How This Comes to Life</h3>

<p>The best narrative strategy drives more than just marketing - it creates a north star for the whole organization.</p>

<p>Here’s how I could see this coming to life:</p>

<p>Marketing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new brand marketing campaign centered around LinkedIn as a learning network.</li>
  <li>A marketing campaign centered around learning journeys, not careers (<em>“Don’t become a marketing manager, become someone who knows how to run user research”</em>)</li>
  <li>A GTM motion that leverages communities of practice - not building your audience, but finding your people</li>
  <li>Show the magic: show the most transformative posts in the feed and frame them as learning moments</li>
  <li>A deeper and expanded partnership with <a href="https://www.tearthepaperceiling.org/">the paper ceiling</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Product:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A north star for the LinkedIn feed around what a “good” post is. Centering value around learning</li>
  <li>A better experience for curating who you follow based on who you can learn from</li>
  <li>New ways for people to share their courses and learning journeys on their profile</li>
  <li>New tools for course providers and education platforms to hook into LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="33-future-concepts">3.3 Future Concepts</h3>

<p>This brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does <em>today</em> but what about future concepts? Here’s five:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A new L&amp;D platform from LinkedIn that deeply integrates learning and skills with the individual benefit - allowing companies to invest in skills and better understand their employees learning journeys.</li>
  <li>A go to market strategy for LinkedIn to reach students and a younger demographic as they enter the workforce, centered around learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>A new approach to job ads that encourage companies to list “what you’ll learn” as a core part of the job description</li>
  <li>An evolution of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/4/23624241/linkedin-collaborative-articles-ai-prompts-content">collaborative articles</a> designed around collaborative curriculums</li>
  <li>Within this brand idea <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/16/linkedin-wants-to-add-gaming-to-its-platform/">LinkedIn Games</a> actually makes sense since games are powerful vehicles for learning (though I’d rather see this look more like duolingo and less like wordle)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Here’s something bananas. A performance improvement plan is a <em>negative</em> thing! WTF. Performance. Improvement. Plan. That’s the thing you do so that you can fire someone right? No. Let’s reclaim the performance improvement plan. It’s a vision for personal growth and transformation <strong>through work</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of learning coming last, what if it came first.</p>

            <p>The world of work is changing.</p>

<p>AI, WFH &amp; layoffs. WTF. The social contract between employers and employees is weakened. In this world of work - people don’t want to engage with a <em>professional network</em>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a world of doomscrolling, algorithmic feeds and fake news - social media is the new tobacco. People don’t want to engage with another <em>social network</em>.</p>

<p>So we need a new script for the world of work. Maybe the future is… LinkedIn?</p>

<p>I think LinkedIn has a unique opportunity - a cultural moment around work, coupled with a unique proposition: real networks and real utility.</p>

<p>What if LinkedIn positioned itself not as a professional network or social network but as a <strong>learning network</strong>. A personal learning network for every user - centered on their personal development.</p>

<p><img src="/images/linkedin-banner.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First, let’s dive into how the world is changing.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-employer--employee-relationship-is-weakening">1.1 The Employer / Employee Relationship is Weakening</h3>

<p>People don’t want to lean in, they want to sit down. Everyone everywhere is tired all the time. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamramdurai/">Gautam</a> has an incredibly insightful series connecting work memes to employee engagement stats to take a close look at “what’s going on” and the vibe shift in the world of work:</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="The%20culture%20of%20work%20%7C%20(1%2F3)%20never%20not%20tired" data-author="Gautam Ramdurai" cite="https://snowbird.substack.com/p/the-culture-of-work-13-never-not?utm_campaign=post&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=true">
<p>The final reason for our collective discontent is the <strong>dissonance between what we see in the economy and our lives.</strong> I am not here to debate if there is an actual connection in any of these examples - it’s about the perception that drives emotions of disengagement. In Vietnam, a booming economy didn’t translate into paychecks. The country’s economic gains haven’t been felt among the young - and housing has gotten worse. How is it that the S&amp;P in the West and Nikkei in the East have been smashing records but we’re yet to contain the layoff contagion? When Google laid off people last year, the biggest head-scratcher for my peers was ‘how could a company sitting on $100B in cash need layoffs?’ </p><p>It didn’t matter what the (however logical) explanation was, it made them change how they <strong>felt</strong> about their work.</p>

<p>If the stability of jobs is at risk - why care about that promotion or getting ahead?

<h3 id="12-social-media-is-the-new-tobacco">1.2 Social Media is the new Tobacco</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, social media is the new tobacco. Last year the surgeon general issued a stark warning for social media companies about the risks of social media and mental health.</p>

<p>Social media can present a real risk to the mental health of children and teenagers because of the ways their brains are affected by the amount of time they spend using it, the U.S. surgeon general warns in a new advisory released Tuesday. </p>   <p>"Teens who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms, which is particularly concerning given that the average amount of time that kids use social media is 3 1/2 hours a day," the Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy told <em>Morning Edition</em> host Steve Inskeep.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: it’s not just about teens. We’re all spending too much time on social media and while the effects are blended - we suffer the same downsides of depression and anxiety. Comparing ourselves to others, feeding dissociation and angering us.</p>

<p>Every social network has chum content and LinkedIn is no different. Over the years we’ve seen the rise of bro-etry and cringe “thought leadership” and crying CEOs. When I scroll my feed I have to sidestep the clearly threadboi and #personalbrand engagement-farming posts and try and focus on the real content.</p>

<p>The laws of enshittification<sup id="fnref:wiki"><a href="#fn:wiki" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for social networks says that the most profitable thing would probably be for LinkedIn to just turn up the dials on engagement farming - but how is that working for X and Facebook? What we need is a vision for a social network that has actual utility, not doomscrolling.</p>

<p>Summary: In a world of addictive social media, positioning LinkedIn as a <em>social network</em> just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<h3 id="13-online-education-is-still-just-getting-started">1.3 Online Education is <em>still</em> just getting started</h3>

<p>Online education absolutely exploded in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. The subsequent pullback is <em>not</em> a bearish sign but merely a renormalization of growth. I believe we’re still just getting started with online education.</p>

<p>Sure E-learning is a $200B+ market but that doesn’t even account for the variety of different types of online learning that happen. Look at Masterclass, Reforge, Maven and more. We are living in an explosion of online education. But it’s not just courses, it’s <a href="https://www.reforge.com/artifacts">real work examples</a>, <a href="https://adplist.org/">mentorship</a> and more.</p>

<p>And of course, AI is going to completely reshape the skills landscape in the next decade.</p>

The leadership development industry, however, is in a state of upheaval. The number of players offering courses to impart the hard and soft skills required of corporate managers has soared. And yet organizations that collectively spend billions of dollars annually to train current and future executives are growing frustrated with the results. Several large-scale industry studies, along with our own in-depth interviews with clients, indicate that more than 50% of senior leaders believe that their talent development efforts don’t adequately build critical skills and organizational capabilities.

<p><strong>What do you mean by skills as a tremendous behavior change?</strong></p>
<p>I think for many years we really believed in the notion that there was a primary focus for every professional, and believed in skill matching between an employer and employees. If I want to hire somebody on your team for a job, I would look first and foremost at their skills. For years, the industry has relied primarily on pedigree and which companies you work for. Now we’re seeing more and more that there is, in my opinion, a tremendous change towards focusing on the skills you have.</p>
<p>For example, we have tools that we offer to recruiters, which are able to create a pipeline of candidates, to source, and to reach out. We’re seeing close to almost 50 percent of recruiters using skills right now to look for professionals. That’s a big deal. That wasn’t the case before, and it’s increasing a lot.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-a-new-brand-for-linkedin">Part 3: A New Brand for LinkedIn</h2>

<h3 id="31-the-brand-concept-linkedin-as-a-learning-network">3.1 The Brand Concept: LinkedIn as a Learning Network</h3>

<p>If anyone has the opportunity to come to the table with a fresh point of view on the future of work it’s LinkedIn. We need a new idea for what work can be that energizes people and also prepares for the biggest skills shift we’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>And we need a model that energizes and speaks to employers, employees, gig workers and advertisers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LinkedIn: not a social network, not a professional network - a <strong><em>learning network</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an age of meaningless meetings and doomscrolling, LinkedIn is the antidote. A fresh, thoughtful approach for everyone (employers, employees, advertisers) to re-engage with the world of work in a way that empowers the individual, frames personal growth as engaging and valuable and prepares everyone for the AI-future that is looming.</p>

<p>The magic here is that LinkedIn is already the best place for learning. I took the time to re-orient my feed from old connections to people I actually wanted to follow and now my LinkedIn feed is higher signal to noise than Twitter, Threads, Bluesky and the rest of em.</p>

<p>And this leverages LinkedIn’s advantage - they’re a network centered around real people, and providing real utility. This is the reason to believe.</p>

<p>It’s good for everyone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good for LinkedIn: stronger brand position, clearer unified purpose across feed, profile, recruiting and learning</li>
  <li>Good for employers: employers who invest in employee learning do better</li>
  <li>Good for employees: a positive vision of social media and professional networking</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: this is more than a vision for LinkedIn Learning, this is a vision for LinkedIn as a whole. It elevates learning as a thing that happens in and with your community whether you’re in the feed, in groups, applying for jobs or engaging with learning.</em></p>

<h3 id="32-how-this-comes-to-life">3.2 How This Comes to Life</h3>

<p>The best narrative strategy drives more than just marketing - it creates a north star for the whole organization.</p>

<p>Here’s how I could see this coming to life:</p>

<p>Marketing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new brand marketing campaign centered around LinkedIn as a learning network.</li>
  <li>A marketing campaign centered around learning journeys, not careers (<em>“Don’t become a marketing manager, become someone who knows how to run user research”</em>)</li>
  <li>A GTM motion that leverages communities of practice - not building your audience, but finding your people</li>
  <li>Show the magic: show the most transformative posts in the feed and frame them as learning moments</li>
  <li>A deeper and expanded partnership with <a href="https://www.tearthepaperceiling.org/">the paper ceiling</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Product:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A north star for the LinkedIn feed around what a “good” post is. Centering value around learning</li>
  <li>A better experience for curating who you follow based on who you can learn from</li>
  <li>New ways for people to share their courses and learning journeys on their profile</li>
  <li>New tools for course providers and education platforms to hook into LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="33-future-concepts">3.3 Future Concepts</h3>

<p>This brand idea is cohesive across everything LinkedIn does <em>today</em> but what about future concepts? Here’s five:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A new L&amp;D platform from LinkedIn that deeply integrates learning and skills with the individual benefit - allowing companies to invest in skills and better understand their employees learning journeys.</li>
  <li>A go to market strategy for LinkedIn to reach students and a younger demographic as they enter the workforce, centered around learning opportunities.</li>
