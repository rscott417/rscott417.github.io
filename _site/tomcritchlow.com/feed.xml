        <title>Taking Blogging Seriously</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a warm summer night in NYC and I’m walking through central park with a friend, the fireflies blink around us like an external reflection of the neurons firing in our brains as the conversation sparks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google is Grounded and Needs to Learn How to Soar</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3,573 Days On The Road</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;ba b--black-10 bg-newgreen-light br2 pa3 f5 i&quot;&gt;
Every year on the 24th October I&apos;ve written a reflection on the last year of my independent consulting. This would have been my 10th issue, but is instead a special issue, for reasons that will become apparent.&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Working With Founders Who Have Conviction and Taste</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
