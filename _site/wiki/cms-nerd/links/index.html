<p>I’m such a sucker for the insider baseball of CMS’s. How do they work? What do they look like? Where’s the innovation?</p>

<p>I’ve been involved in consulting for a variety of different CMS projects over the years so I’m always hungry for little details that make a difference.</p>

<p>Also increasingly the enterprise CMS market is getting more advanced and is (finally) outpacing the consumer Wordpress market.</p>

<p>Interesting links and examples:</p>
