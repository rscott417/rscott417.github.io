  <p>In Robert’s account, as in Geoffrey’s Historia, Merlin is created as a demon spawn to become the Antichrist and reverse the effect of the Harrowing of Hell. This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future. Robert lays great emphasis on Merlin’s power to shapeshift,[note 1] on his joking personality, and on his connection to the Holy Grail, the quest for which he foretells.</p>

<p>A universal theory of BusinessMagik</p>

<p>Merlin was the OG consultant
Of kings and queens and consultants (and mages and jesters)
Business functions like a monarchy
There’s a reason we talk about samurai and freelancers</p>

<p>Skills of the mage (consultant):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scrying</li>
  <li>Soothsaying</li>
  <li>Truth-telling</li>
  <li>Divination</li>
  <li>Spells</li>
  <li>Wisdom</li>
</ul>

<p>“Ideas about a person’s place in society, his role, lifestyle, and ego qualities will lose their hold as the cohesive forces in society disintegrate. Subculture values will proliferate to such a bewildering extent that a whole new class of professionals will arise to control them. Such a Transmutation Technology will deal in fashions, in ways of being. Lifestyle consultants will become the new priests of our civilizations. They will be the new magicians.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Magical practices offer heightened expectations and altered experiences of both magicians and participants in a variety of performances and in “qualified places,” from Davos, monetary policy committee rooms, and courts of law, to concept restaurants, fashion runways, and award ceremonies. The study of magic in contemporary society privileges forms of charismatic explanation for phenomena, rather than rationally “explaining away” curiosities. Indeed, “magic is alive and well” (Masquelier 2004: 95) and adds to our growing enchantment of modernity’s—and capitalism’s—global reach.</p>
