<p>A fragment of an idea.</p>

<p>If the city is now cityOS - a networked urban environment - how might it be possible to “crash” the city?</p>

<p>Example ways to crash the city:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call 15 ubers/lyfts to the same location at the same time. Could you freeze a city block with traffic on demand?</li>
  <li>Hiring taskrabbits to “jam” a subway station by carrying large items through it</li>
  <li>Create a fake giveaway to swarm a place (e.g. hamilton ticket giveaway)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the city is now cityOS then “bugs” in the system can “crash” the city.</p>
