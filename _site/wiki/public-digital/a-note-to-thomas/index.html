<p>Below is copy pasted from an email to a good friend who’s teaching a course on entrepreneurship for political science students:</p>

<p>I’m a huge fan of Gary Chou and his entrepreneurial design course. It drives home the making and launching aspect in really fun creative ways. He re-named it to <a href="https://postindustrialdesign.school/">https://postindustrialdesign.school/</a> - but you can find the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Zlq4nQ5BgR-dkOKGqLua7fLkblcLksCNeHnJPkQlvQ/edit">course online here</a>.</p>

<p>For political science students and working with institutions and organizations I highly recommend diving into the work of <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/">Helsinki Design Lab</a>. They have a few books available on print on demand I’d highly recommend: <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/studio-book.html">http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/studio-book.html</a>&amp; <a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/legible-practises.html">http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/legible-practises.html</a></p>

<p>Also - for working with and inside government you should follow the GDS in the UK. They are slightly less radical now but they started as a very radical and interesting group. Their alumni is a list of amazing people. Not quite sure where to start but this is good: <a href="https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/">https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/</a> (and public.digital is the latest venture from some of the original GDS folks)</p>

<p>Lastly - you should put the course online! I’ve been <a href="http://www.wordsinspace.net/mapsmedia/fall2018/">following along remotely with this course</a> since pretty much the whole course is posted online. I think this open access / collaborative / blogging model is really powerful.</p>
