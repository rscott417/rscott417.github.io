  "<p>There’s something deeper here - too much of adulting is designed to stamp out individual creative expression. And when we do finally carve out the time for some creative projects the world encourages us to keep it to ourselves. To journal in our bedroom, to paint in our basement, to hide away from others. Who taught us that creative joy should be a secret?</p>",

She’s trying to <em>generate</em> questions. For her the flower is the locus of many mental threads, some nascent, some spanning her career. Her field notebook is not some convenient way to store lifeless data to be presented in lifeless papers so that other scientists can replicate some dull experiment; it’s the site of a collision between a mind and a world.</p>",

  "<p>Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users <em>and</em> in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.</p>",
  "<p>For decades, Google’s advantage has been the open web. Billions of pages indexed in milliseconds. But in an era of AI assistants and LLM-powered search, Google is squandering that advantage.</p>",
  "<p>First with AI Overviews, then most recently with AI Mode - both experiments from Google seem short-sighted as experiences:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/ai-overviews-ai-mode.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Not a link in sight, search has turned into a dead-end.</p>",
  "<p>How did we get here?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"google-is-grounded\">Google is Grounded</h2>",
  "<p>“Grounding” an LLM in search is a technical process where basically the opposite of what you think happens. You’d think grounding means: “Find the best sources, then write the answer.” But with LLMs, it’s often: “Write the answer, then find sources that sort of back it up.” It’s like writing a school essay and adding the citations after.</p>",
  "<p>Instead of the search results being used to inform the answer - with grounding, the answer is used to inform the search results.</p>",
  "<p>If I understand correctly (and I’ll be the first to admit I’m no expert here) the grounding process essentially augments the LLM with key info from web pages to ensure that each of the claims and statements in the response is correct and true. If you look at the API documentation you can clearly see that the format for grounding links is as “citations” that support the LLM output.</p>",
  "<p>For a technical overview of the grounding process <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview\">see this post</a>, or for a more specific look at how Gemini grounds in search <a href=\"https://dejan.ai/blog/hacking-gemini/\">see this post</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The grounding process improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations! So it’s an effective part of the response.</p>",
  "<p>Unfortunately, I think somewhere along the lines we confused a technical process for a consumer-grade UX.</p>",
  "<p>It seems fairly likely to me that the grounding process is what’s powering the links included in both AI Overviews and AI Mode. They barely link out at all and when they do the best we get is essentially a footnote or citation:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/ai-citations.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Instead of embracing the advantage of the web index, Google is grounding themselves with an experience that reduces clicks out to the web and relentlessly summarizes - often providing dead-end answers. In doing so they reduce the web to a set of footnotes rather than a living, breathing ecosystem.</p>",
  "<p>It’s not that grounding is wrong - it’s a valuable part of the process to generate accurate responses. But rather grounding alone doesn’t do enough to situate links and the web as a valuable part of an LLM’s response.</p>",
  "<p>I think Google can do better.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-better-way\">A Better Way</h2>",
  "<p>Needless to say, lots of people are concerned about an information ecosystem that destroys the vibrancy, diversity and depth of the open web. I believe there’s a better way - and while playing around <strong>I found that simply writing a better system prompt inside Gemini gave me radically better results than the current AI Mode response</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>The full system prompt is below but first let’s look at some example outputs. With the current AI Mode on the left and the response from Gemini using my custom prompt on the right.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Why is this better?</strong> Well there’s two clear reasons in my mind:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li><strong>I think it’s better as a user</strong>. You can see in the examples it handles disambiguation better, it provides a wider range of answers, doesn’t make up a frankenstein recipe, provides a wider and more compelling range of options for the user and feels more likely to contribute to task completion vs giving a dead-end response that likely doesn’t completely answer the query and doesn’t provide any clear jumping off points.</li><br />  <li><strong>I think it’s better for the information ecosystem</strong>. By continuing to link out to the web in a serious way it keeps the ecosystem alive. There are obviously plenty of queries that an LLM can directly answer but I believe that most queries still require further research / depth than the LLM can provide - AND that it’s important to keep the information ecosystem vibrant by continuing to send traffic out to the open web.</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>(Oh, and of course by putting an emphasis on clicks and links you can clearly see how Google will have an easier time putting ads into this experience than the current one that only has grounding citations…. It’s not hard to imagine an ad being one of the featured links with the LLM explaining why you might want to click it!)</p>",
  "<p>That said - this prototype isn’t without it’s flaws:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>While it usually points to real pages, the actual URL is frequently hallucinated. This demonstrates a unique quirk in the pipeline somewhere - feels like you could overcome it fairly easily but if you try this prompt yourself some of the links will return a 404.</li><br />  <li>Testing the custom prompt inside the Gemini app (vs on a web page) almost always returns no links. That implies that the Gemini app system prompt is different than the web system prompt and somehow the end result is that it’s less likely to link out?</li><br />  <li>The AI can get a little verbose and floral in it’s summary. Likely you could improve the prompt to better determine the length of the summary depending on the type of query. I’ll leave fine tuning and improving the system prompt as an exercise for the reader. (If you write a better one email it to me!)</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"google-is-grounded-and-needs-to-learn-how-to-soar\">Google is Grounded and needs to learn how to SOAR</h2>",
  "<p>In a world of LLM-search a few things I believe will be true:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Queries will get longer and more complex</li><br />  <li>Overall query volume will increase dramatically</li><br />  <li>LLM search is a real threat to the information ecosystem of the open web</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>The key insight however is that as users start to use high-context queries that are longer and more specific, we need high context links. It’s no longer enough to match the query to “10 blue links” - we need to move beyond that to a world where LLMs can sell you on <em>why</em> you should click each link. How does each link relate to your query? Why should you trust the link? What will you get when you click? How is each link distinct from the other links presented?</p>",
  "<p>As you can see from the Gemini examples above this is all possible today! This example from above really stands out to me:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2025-03-24-18-03-18.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>This is a great link! It provides context, tells me why I might want to click and feels genuinely useful (and the LLM is not wrong - the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/04/10/1167158933/fred-again-tiny-desk-concert\">Fred again… tiny desk concert</a> is indeed well worth your time).</p>",
  "<p>Ok, the framework is hokey but I wanted something memorable. Google should learn how to SOAR: Surface, Offer, Assist, Redirect</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>Surface</strong>: An AI response should offer links that directly meet your needs. Not just matching the query but matching your intent with specificity. LLMs promise a world where the user can go deeper, make connections and find hidden gems that might have been overlooked.</li><br />  <li><strong>Offer</strong>: It’s not enough to add a citation link - the AI response should <em>sell you</em> on each link. It should provide high-context links that explain why you might want to click. “Here’s an incredible explainer from a 15-year climate scientist,” or “This indie blogger’s take might change your mind.” Sell the click. Make it irresistible.</li><br />  <li><strong>Assist</strong>: Instead of providing dead-end answers the AI response should aim to support task completion - it’s not always about information efficiency, it’s about supporting the user on their journey - curating, contextualizing and nudging them towards action. Less answers and more assistance.</li><br />  <li><strong>Redirect</strong>: And most importantly, redirect. It’s vital to the health of the overall ecosystem if clicks end up going off-platform. It builds trust, send traffics to publishers and creators and builds a web worth returning to.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing Thoughts</h2>",
  "<p>In my opinion AI Overviews and AI Mode reveal a deeper truth - Google doesn’t yet have a compelling vision for the future of search in an LLM world. They’re bolting new tech onto an old system and in doing so, risk losing both the magic of the web and the business model that made Google thrive.</p>",
  "<p>So if you have a stake in the web (see my disclosures below!) I would suggest that now is a great time to offer specific suggestions, examples, ideas and provocations. Google isn’t a cyborg, it’s 180,000 humans in a trenchcoat. And those humans are trying to figure out the future of search just like we are and I think they’re willing to listen.</p>",
  "<hr />",
  "<p><em>Disclosure: I probably have too many conflicts of interest to name individually. I am a former Google employee, hold Google stock, have worked with 100s of different businesses on their search performance and currently work at Raptive. I’m also an un-ashamed advocate for the open web. Consider me biased. However, all opinions here are purely my own.</em></p>",
  "<p>–</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Update May 27th, 2025: <a href=\"https://x.com/pashmerepat/status/1926717705660375463?t=IN1_YgacqtUk_X_COZBXcw&amp;s=19\">I liked this perspective</a>, that maybe RAG is actually a dead end and that agentic search is just a better paradigm. Agentic search is much more like what I’m describing here and RAG is the core underpinning of AI Mode and AI Overviews….*</li><br /></ul><br />"

  "<ul><br />  <li>The first time a “real business” signs your SOW and pays your invoice you start to feel the horizon opening up in front of you.

(Year 2)</li><br />  <li>The emotional, financial and time freedom to invest yourself in all kinds of quasi-work activities (like blogging) and non-work activities (like Kung Fu).</li><br />  <li>The agility and optionality of being independent to be able to take an 18-month road trip during COVID, while the kids were young (year 6)</li><br />  <li>The space to be able to remain intellectually interested in the work, studying, reading papers and writing essays - while doing the work but not being so overloaded to be able to pick your head up and think.</li><br />  <li>The ability to attract a rag tag band of fellow indie travelers - to find fellow weirdos, vagabonds and eccentrics to be able to draft off of, talk to and ask for advice.

Much love to every single one ❤️.</p>",
  "<p>Ok, so let’s talk about the book for a second. After dragging my feet for far too long already I decided to PROPERLY focus on the book for a season at the start of this year. That process led to a very-close-to-finished manuscript. It’s an actual book! Not just a collection of blog posts… But as the year progressed it became clear that I needed to get back to work to keep some money coming in and the book once again fell to the back burner.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s still the plan to get the book finished and published, but I’m also kind of done making excuses.

  "<p>But over the last few years I’ve been building an advisory practice which is lighter touch, designed for earlier stage companies but still has that sense of me being useful and giving a shit about your business.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s the TL;DR:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>I work with founders who have conviction and taste, to reach your next phase of growth.</strong></li><br />  <li>Building audience and attention online requires a combination of market positioning, product and content and that’s the skillset I bring to every engagement.</li><br />  <li>I am equally comfortable delivering strategy and getting hands on in the weeds with you</li><br />  <li>I’ve got a broad skillset - from building an investor presentation, a finance spreadsheet to a user research prototype.</li><br />  <li>Active Advisory work is typically a ~$6k / month</li><br />  <li>I’ve got a few spots open starting later this year.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://calendly.com/tomcritchlow\">Grab a time on my calendly</a> if you want to chat.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p><strong><em>“I like working with you”</em></strong> my client said, <strong><em>“because you’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves”</em></strong>.</p>",
  "<p>This phrase changed my whole approach to consulting. Before then, I’d always been concerned about being perceived as senior - trying hard to stay at the strategic level and not getting involved in the more junior work. Sometimes I would be afraid to do the straightforward tasks, even if they were the most useful thing.</p>",
  "<p>This stemmed from a kind of imposter syndrome - I was worried of becoming “just a freelancer” or low-level outsourced solution instead of being seen as a “consultant” and given permission and access to work on the more strategic, more interesting problems.</p>",
  "<p>But the truth is that clients value clarity and they value momentum. There’s real value in complexity taming. And there’s only so much strategy work that needs doing before you need to start getting your hands dirty (and the best strategy emerges from doing the work). This realization set me on the path to discovering <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/06/28/strategy-stewardship/\">strategy and stewardship</a> as a model of working and my relentless focus on <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/\">being useful at all times</a>.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve spent my career as typically the most creative person in a room of technologists or the most technical in a room full of creatives. This duality means that I can often create clarity and momentum in lots of situations that otherwise would be stuck. I can shortcut the design process or shortcut the scoping process to help teams move faster and get more clarity quickly.</p>",

  "<p>Here’s a real example - I’ve been working with <a href=\"https://doubleloop.app/\">DoubleLoop</a> for about 6 months as an advisor. Initially we had structured this in a typical “growth advisory” capacity: I’ll charge an hourly rate for a phone call once every two weeks.</p>",
  "<p>This was…. fine? But consulting and advising is not smooth - like the poker adage it’s “hours of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror”.</p>",
  "<p>Our conversations would probe at useful growth mechanics and we were making progress but everything suddenly ratcheted up a notch when DoubleLoop suddenly dropped into fund-raising mode. All of a sudden the problems around positioning were concrete, immediate and urgent.</p>",

  "<p>They aren’t afraid of problems that are hard to define or challenges that require strategy and execution. It’s not about adhering too tightly to the scope of work and it’s not about polishing your work until it shines. It’s about running towards the most urgent, important problems for your clients to deliver tangible value.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"its-what-clients-want\">It’s What Clients Want</h2>",
  "<p>Although this is the first time I’m calling it “active advising” my longest running and most impactful consulting work actually looks pretty similar to this. Thinking back on some client projects:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Working with a private equity firm to incubate a new content business, soup to nuts content strategy, commercialization, positioning and more to help them grow from zero to &gt; 150k visits / month and hundred of thousands of email subscribers.</li><br />  <li>Working with Reviews.com to support their growth - getting involved in everything from hiring, operations, strategy and content workflows - guiding them from early growth through to acquisition.</li><br />  <li>Working with Glitch on growth strategy, helping to define the marketing org chart and and figure out their GTM even before they had a revenue model.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Growth is a connected system of product, brand, marketing and data and I’ve spent my career spanning across these disciplines.</p>",
  "<p>People I’ve worked with include CEO, CPO, CMO or COO:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p><em>“Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.”</em> - COO</p><br /></blockquote>",

  "<h2 id=\"how-does-active-advising-work\">How Does Active Advising Work?</h2>",
  "<p>Here are some of the principles that I’ve found necessary to make this active advising model work:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I need enough context to be useful. This typically means regular touchpoints, but also ideally access to the weekly report the executive team reads, or the board meeting deck or whatever artifact is being created on a regular basis so that I can always have context of “what’s going on” right now.</li><br />  <li>We should go towards the work. There’s only so much you can do by talking about the work - you need to actually get stuck in. If we’re talking about hiring, let’s jam on the job description together. If you’re trying to frame something for investors, let’s open up the pitch deck.</li><br />  <li>You have to challenge assumptions. This requires a degree of mutual trust and openness to be able to really re-think assumptions, challenge blindspots and help clients see things in new ways.</li><br />  <li>It requires unlimited access. No one wants to count the hours spent or think twice about reaching out because it might trigger a bill. The best work is done inside fast feedback loops and requires a kind of “always available” mentality.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Because of this:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I’m usually in the client’s slack and/or whatsapp for fast async work.</li><br />  <li>We have a baseline of regular touchpoints, typically bi-weekly but with faster more engaged sprints around key projects and milestones</li><br />  <li>We have a running set of notes that captures what the most important and urgent challenges and opportunities are</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>All in the best way to price this is with a fixed fee. Typically something like $6k / month.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"who-this-is-for\">Who This Is For</h2>",
  "<p>The two archetypes that I’ve done the most work with:</p>",
  "<p>For startups:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>Supporting GTM and marketing strategy</li><br />  <li>Fund raising and developing a vision, thesis and TAM</li><br />  <li>Brand positioning and messaging</li><br />  <li>Hiring, processes and operations</li><br />  <li>Building growth loops, growth teams and growth processes</li><br />  <li>Analytics and reporting</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>For executives:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>Helping to build influence, communicate better and build buy-in across the org</li><br />  <li>Supporting clear strategy development that can be communicated across the company</li><br />  <li>Designing better executive dashboards or quarterly off-sites.</li><br />  <li>Being a sparring partner for the chaos of work</li><br />  <li>Vetting vendors, supporting resource allocation and developing an investment thesis for key channels</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"why-me\">Why me?</h2>",
  "<p>Some things that might be relevant:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Built Distilled an SEO agency into 50+ people across 3 locations</li><br />  <li>Led special projects at Google working with teams like the Creative Lab and BizOps</li><br />  <li>Developed multi-million dollar SEO strategies for brands</li><br />  <li>Created award winning content campaigns</li><br />  <li>Hired, managed and led teams</li><br />  <li>Sold millions of dollars worth of professional services</li><br />  <li>Assembled innovation teams, run customer research, designed product interfaces and built landing pages</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p>Recently I asked myself a question: after working as a consultant for 10 years, across some 40 companies: what makes some companies more successful than others? Is there anything I’ve observed that might predict success?</p>",
  "<p>The answer I’ve arrived at, somewhat surprisingly, is that having a key executive being customer-centric is a key determining factor. Note that this is a more specific insight than merely “having a culture of being customer-centric”, though of course one is related to the other. The key I think is that it’s about decision making. It’s not enough to have customer-centric thinking, you need customer-centric <strong>decisions</strong> - and that requires some kind of senior executive sponsor.</p>",
  "<p>This is of course anecdotal - there are plenty of factors that determine success but this has been validated on a few key consulting projects where I’ve observed first hand the departure of a key customer-centric executive and the subsequence decline of the organization.</p>",
  "<p>Interestingly - <strong>every single company I work with would claim to be customer-centric</strong>. Just like every company claims to be data-driven, it’s become a kind of generic stance that companies adopt. After all - who would claim to <em>ignore</em> their customers?

  "<p>Here’s one definition of being customer-centric: the ability to prioritize things that you can’t immediately measure. This is hard! Many businesses are a slave to their data and so one definition of this is that being customer-centric is being able to prioritize things that customers need/want <strong>above and beyond what is measurable</strong>.

  "<p>Obviously customer behaviors are changing in all kinds of ways, but one fundamental truth that is radically different in the age of the internet is choice. Not just that customer have more choice than ever (somewhat obvious) but a consequence of this is that <a href=\"https://patticus.com/2023/12/16/competitive-research-playbook/#always-cuddle-with-the-chaos\">buyers look at three times more of your competitors than they used to</a>:</p>",

  "<p>My hunch: customer-centric thinking (and executive leadership) <em>only</em> matters for the least commoditized areas.

  "<h1 id=\"part-2-becoming-customer-centric\">Part 2: Becoming Customer Centric</h1>",
  "<p>Ok, so we’ve taken a view across the landscape and explored what it means to be customer centric a little. But how do you <em>become</em> customer centric? In particular, I think the key idea is not <em>“how do you get an organization to be customer centric?”</em> but rather <em>“how do you get a key executive to become customer centric?”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>There are various guides about <em>organizations</em> becoming customer centric like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/resources/how-to-build-customer-centric-culture/\">this good piece by Survey Monkey</a>:</p>",

  "<p>But something about this makes me feel uneasy - internal satisfaction surveys? It all feels a bit like paying lip service to an idea that needs to be deeply ingrained. A measured approach to something unmeasurable, a tangible approach to something intangible…</p>",
  "<p>My lived experience working with founders, CEOs and executives is that the power is in something more personal. It’s not about a company-wide culture of being customer-centric as much as a singular vision, passion and voice for being customer centric that comes from a key executive that enables customer-centric decision making.</p>",

Well, much like a Wardly map is non-confrontational tool to critically discuss strategy, maybe a <strong>customer service map</strong> is a non-confrontational tool to critically discuss customer-centric ideas.

  "<p>When I think about the most successful consulting engagements over the last 10 years, it’s the ones where I could help (in some small way) key executives view the world around them in a different light. To help them become slightly more attuned to the reality of customer experience and to be slightly better at putting themselves in the customer’s shoes.</p>",
  "<p>This rarely happens in a single moment, but rather through a gradual ongoing process of introspection, discussion and surprise. The surprise is key to jolting executives out of their established ways of looking and ways of thinking to consider things anew, to look at things with fresh eyes.</p>",
  "<p>👟👟👟</p>",
  "<p>Let’s wrap this up. I want to keep exploring this idea of customer-centric thinking, so here’s some open questions I have right now:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>What is the distinction between a customer-centric culture and a single customer-centric executive? How are they different and the same? Is it possible for a bottoms-up approach to being customer-centric or can this only happen top down?</li><br />  <li>What are the systemic forces inside an organization that prevent executives from being customer-centric? Why is this a rare skill?</li><br />  <li>What metrics should businesses be measuring around customer experience? In a world where customers look at 3x the competitors they used to, how do you create a customer-first view of the alternatives and options that users have?</li><br />  <li>How might you build a training program like the disney institute designed to create new perspectives for executives, but designed for URL experiences, not IRL experiences?</li><br /></ol>",

A third critical question of internal logic that should be addressed explicitly rather than left to whim and chance is about how <em>personal </em>the business is: to what degree and in what ways the business is <em>for</em> its founders (or <em>for</em> some group of insiders which is meant to grow beyond the founders, as is the case for many partnership firms)?</p><br /><p>There are many things that founders or other key players who have the power to shape a venture’s evolution and to choose whether/how to make the venture meaningfully <em>for</em> them might want. They might aspire to pursue a certain vision of the world or to create wealth, which relate to the points we’ve explored above. They might want to be in charge, or to be able to focus on certain kinds of work they like doing, or to work with particular people whose company they enjoy, or to build their personal brands.</p><br /><p>At one end of a continuum is a business that’s created and fully acknowledged to be a “lifestyle business.” If two brothers want to restore classic cars together, make a certain level of income doing so, and take July and August off, more power to them. Would that every business should be so clear about its commitments.</p><br /><p>The great danger here lies in the middle ground, where the point of the organization isn’t explicitly meant to be the fulfillment of the founders’ vision for their own good lives, but where the personal desires of founders (or other powerful people) in fact shape a range of decisions. The founder who isn’t a strong CEO but who wants to be in charge (perhaps wants to be active in the business and “doesn’t want to have a boss” or perhaps just values being able to call all the shots) not only risks managing poorly, but risks undermining the belief that the organization truly stands for a commitment to something larger than himself. Strong founders and strong leaders make clear that they are accountable to higher goals and to impersonal standards—they create a “government of laws, not men.”</p><br /><footer>@humanenterprise<cite> <a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business\">https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/internal-logic-business</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",

All of the kinds of things that a notebook does for you.</li><br />  <li>Doodling, diagramming and constructing more involved elaborate ideas.

I’ve read so many more academic papers over the last year directly because of my Remarkable.</li><br />  <li>I’ve been working with a client to make a Monthly Business Review packet - it’s 50+ pages of charts and data, Amazon-style, and on a whim I loaded it onto my Remarkable as a PDF and it’s a great way to read all the data (and add little annotations!). Now I load each month on there and sit down and read it front to back.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Fun, quirky uses:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Helping my daughter Roxy with her maths homework! I find that explaining things like mathematical concepts in a space where you can easily erase, switch pages etc is useful.

  "<p>I work with my Remarkable template right next to my laptop screen every day. It functions a lot like a second screen - except getting things onto my tablet is a slightly slow process.

  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-02-09-11-13-02.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p><em>(I just faked this demo with a PDF but a live-calendar view imported from Google Calendar would be awesome - I’d like more room to scribble on my calendar pls)</em></p>",
  "<p>Related to this idea - I’d also love a more formal diary / daily entry system. Kind of like Obsidian’s daily notes. Some kind of date-based notebook inside the Remarkable would be rad (even if it doesn’t sync with your actual calendar!). A daily journaling / diary / planning format would be great. (Yes, right now you can select a day-planner template, but you can’t then see them in a calendar view - the date isn’t a foundational element of the note).</p>",
  "<p>Another thing I’d like - a quick-send feature. When you select an object on your tablet you can cut/copy/paste etc. I’d love one more quick-action to email it to yourself. Right now you have the option to send yourself a full page (as png or pdf etc) but often I have a single diagram/sketch that I want to send to myself - I don’t want the full page.</p>",

  "<p>As we know, <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2024/01/23/advice/\">giving advice is tricky</a>. All these ideas are ignorant of the real challenges and focus areas that Remarkable is thinking about. Maybe Remarkable is gearing up to launch Remarkable 3? Maybe they’re trying to push into enterprise use cases? Maybe they’re trying partner with an ebook platform so you can buy and read books? I know at least that international seems to be a focus for them right now.</p>",
  "<p>If I had to guess though, looking at the outside I think one of the core tensions for Remarkable is that they have their own software and they don’t run a stock android install. This is likely both a benefit (full control) and a curse because it makes things like ebooks, loading web pages, syncing with calendars etc much harder…</p>",

  "<p>What to say about the future of AI and search?</p>",
  "<p>Obviously, we don’t know. But I’m going to jot down a few thoughts.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"clicks-to-websites-will-go-updownsideways\">Clicks to Websites will go up/down/sideways?</h2>",
  "<p>There’s an interesting spectrum of responses to the new “generative search experiences” and what it means for clicks out to websites.</p>",
  "<p>The <strong>super optimistic outlook</strong> says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Generative search &amp; AI is going to absolutely explode the number of search queries per user per day. Just like mobile search and youtube search are largely additive to “regular” search, we’re going to see more search queries than ever and eventually more outbound clicks than ever before”</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>pragmatic positive</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Look, Google’s ads business model relies on showing you links and driving clicks to websites. So however the future interface changes there’s going to be a fundamental notion of links and clicks that will continue to exist. So there will be changes big and small to the number of clicks but ultimately it’s not going to be a “50% decline in all search” scenario”</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>pragmatic pessimist</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“Sure, search click curves are going to change - but actually for A LOT of queries you simply don’t need to click out - the query is well served by an LLM model. While many transactional queries will survive, the informational and exploratory queries will be completely re-shaped. This will lead to broad-scale changes across the media landscape in particular.</em></p>",
  "<p>The <strong>super pessimistic</strong> outlook says:</p>",
  "<p><em>“LLMs are going to fundamentally rewrite how people interact with the web to the point that search itself diminishes as a behavior - leading not only to dramatically fewer clicks to websites but even Google’s core ads business model will come under threat.”</em></p>",
  "<p>Whichever outlook you have, I think one thing is becoming obvious - with how fast open source and small local models are getting - I don’t think search is going to be threatened by a membership model (a la $20 / month for chatGPT). I think search is going to remain free and ad supported for some time to come.<sup id=\"fnref:ads\"><a href=\"#fn:ads\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"just-in-time-interfaces\">Just-in-time Interfaces</h2>",
  "<p>There’s another outlook though - maybe the era of search-first is just over? What I mean is this - you could argue that today we <em>start</em> our queries in search (just like we used to start our search in directories many moons ago). Whether it’s voice search, Google search etc we start there.</p>",
  "<p>But you could argue that we’re entering an era where we <em>start</em> our queries with an LLM/assistant interface. Something that results in search <strong><em>some of the time</em></strong> - but NOT all the time. Some times it results in novel, new interfaces - whether it’s a just-in-time UI that is assembled to support your task completion or whether it’s a collaborative document / code environment.</p>",
  "<p>I’ve been playing around with a workflow that goes something like:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Tell GPT what I want to do</li><br />  <li>Ask GPT to think about what interface would enable that task completion</li><br />  <li>Ask GPT to give me the code for that interface</li><br />  <li>Copy and paste that code into Replit</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>This is all quite manual and a little bit slow today - but when it gets it right, the results are magical and truly novel. I could easily imagine a new OpenAI beta playground environment that tried to build interfaces on the fly for you. It’s all there today.</p>",
  "<p>See: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1724990427756200115\">the tldraw experiment that lets you draw a UI and have GPT build a working version</a>.</p>",
  "<p>(Aside: Google search results are essentially adaptive UI designed for the query at this point! I mean look at the custom ecommerce UI all over a standard <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=green+raincoat+for+men\">shopping query</a> these days.)</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"what-new-kinds-of-queries-will-exist\">What new kinds of queries will exist?</h2>",
  "<p>Ok, so if we have a different kind of box to type or talk into - how will this differ from a search box? Well, I think the affordances of natural language will change the kinds of behaviors that we find ourselves familiar with.</p>",
  "<p>Here’s a simple example. People used to search for things with specific location modifiers - think “restaurants in NYC” but as it became obvious and predictable that Google already knows where the query is coming from, we stopped searching for “restaurants in NYC” and started searching for “restaurants near me”.</p>",
  "<p>The “near me” version of queries became the dominant version <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US-NY&amp;q=restaurant%20in%20nyc,restaurant%20near%20me&amp;hl=en\">about 10 years ago</a>.</p>",
  "<p>So the affordances of the search results changes our behavior.</p>",
  "<p>It’s fun to imagine whole new <em>kinds</em> of search queries / questions that you simply wouldn’t type into Google because it wouldn’t make sense. Things like:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><em>Why am I feeling anxious today?</em></li><br />  <li><em>What should I work on today?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Should I take the job offer I was just sent?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Can I afford a holiday this year?</em></li><br />  <li><em>Give me a poem to start my day</em></li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>I’m betting that as we get comfortable talking to LLMs we’ll slowly get comfortable asking more personal, more spiritual, more emotional, more goal-oriented questions and discussions.</p>",
  "<p><em>(Obviously, I’m guessing the real queries of the future will look nothing like this - it’ll be some other weird second order effect that no one anticipated)</em></p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"were-going-to-need-new-ideas-for-measurement\">We’re going to need new ideas for measurement</h2>",
  "<p>Two things we’re going to need to invent new ideas around measurement for: <strong>search quality</strong> and <strong>search rankings</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Google hasn’t had any serious competition for <strong>decades</strong> - and so collectively I think we’ve all kind of given up on measuring search quality? Even Google I think has become lazy in how they measure search quality in recent years.</p>",
  "<p>But it’s suddenly a serious question to ask who did it better for a particular category of search.</p>",
  "<p><em>(In 10 minutes I built a little side by side for Google and Perplexity. Play around here: <a href=\"https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/\">https://llm-search-comparison.replit.app/</a>)</em></p>",
  "<p>Of course - it’s not quite true that no one is measuring search quality. Daniel S. Griffin has <a href=\"https://danielsgriffin.com/docs/2023/07/05/search-audits/\">a really interesting collection of articles, academic papers and resources around “search audits”</a>. Ok, so I guess we all have some homework to do.</p>",
  "<p>But/and - because the affordances are changing and search behavior is changing we’re still going to need some careful thinking around how we measure the quality of search results.</p>",
  "<p>Meanwhile, in the SEO industry, we’ve been relying on “rank tracking” for a long time (too long?). I’m excited that this new era of generative search experiences might usher in some innovation from the SEO tool providers around how we measure performance in search. It’s needed.</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<p>Actually, there’s a third thing we’re going to need to invent new measurement standards for: clicks. AI-assisted clicks. Do they show in analytics? Do bots declare themselves? When a bot browses on your behalf what user-agent does it use? Are bots allowed to fetch URLs on your behalf if they do it locally? Or only via direct user-initiated command?</p>",
  "<p>🤖🤖🤖</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-skill-of-searching\">The Skill of Searching</h2>",
  "<p>Here’s another way of thinking about the impact of LLMs.</p>",
  "<p>You know how some people are just better at searching than others? If you’re reading this article you’re probably thinking that you’re <em>good at searching</em>. Maybe your significant other turns to you to help you find the right thing, maybe you feel like you’re competent at weeding through 10 blue links to find the most relevant result. You’re fluent and competent at the internet.</p>",
  "<p>Being good at searching is a combination of query formulation, looking for signs, recognizing trusted sites etc.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Persistence</strong> - why can’t I ask GPT to remind me next month about something? Or to notify when some future thing happens? This feels like Google Alerts (or Yahoo Pipes) on steroids and it’s simply a quirk of the technology today that they don’t do this.

  "<blockquote><br />  <p><em>“It is not enough for a professional to be right: An advisor’s job is to be helpful.” David Maister - The Trusted Advisor</em></p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p><em>“I can DO IT!”</em> my 7 year old screams at me. She asked for help with her homework, but now - half way through explaining the place value of numbers - she had enough of my help and was physically and emotionally pushing me away - <em>“I can DO IT already”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Of course, she proceeded to not be able to do it.</p>",
  "<p><em>“Yes I know that!”</em> I shouted in exasperation. I was making pancakes for the kids and had only skim-read the recipe. As a result I had forgotten to melt the butter before adding it to the mixture and it was all lumpy. My partner Erin looked over and said <em>“you should have melted the butter before you put it in, would you like me to give you a recipe?”</em>. I had a recipe, but obviously I hadn’t followed it and knew that I had made a mistake. <em>“I KNOW I should have melted the butter, that’s not helpful to me right now!”</em>.</p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is emotionally fraught and complicated. It’s true for 7 year olds, it’s true for me and it’s true for my clients.</p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is an intensely personal thing. The feeling of learning something new sits right next to the feeling of shame for not knowing it in the first place. And worse, in the client/consultant relationship, the client is at least partially complicit in the situation when they come to you.</p>",
  "<p>So, some of the things that might seem “obvious” to you as a consultant can actually be incredibly delicate and problematic. Consider:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Quickly pointing out potential problems with the situation</li><br />  <li>Immediately offering a solution to these problems</li><br />  <li>Stating that things are easily solved</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>You do these things because you want to be seen as an expert, you want to reassure the client that you have the answer and that the client is in good hands.</p>",
  "<p>But think carefully about how these things make the client feel. They can make the client feel stupid, it can place a fair share of blame on the client for the situation and it can make them feel like you didn’t listen carefully enough to their description of the problem before leaping to solutions.</p>",
  "<p>So in this chapter we’re going to look at ways to <strong>resist the urge to add immediate value</strong>. Instead we have to hold space for a more vulnerable, honest and open relationship with our client - to allow them to open up more fully and to work on things that are useful, even if not in scope.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"from-consultant-to-advisor\">From Consultant to Advisor</h2>",
  "<p>In the book Trusted Advisor by David Maister (highly recommended!) there is a a nice illustration that shows the evolution of client/consultant relationships as you get more senior and more strategic:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/advice.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Giving advice is fraught even if the problem is well defined and you <em>do</em> know the answer. So when you’re working on strategic, ill-defined projects where there isn’t a <em>right</em> answer - giving advice is incredibly delicate, and in some cases not even possible.</p>",
  "<p>Eventually in your career you might even stop thinking of yourself as a consultant and start thinking of yourself as an advisor.</p>",
  "<p>And as we see in the diagram - <strong>in order to get access to the deeper emotional layers of advice giving and receiving we need to formulate a close relationship with our clients</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>While giving advice can help you be seen as knowledgeable, it doesn’t necessarily build trust.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"you-should-is-a-dangerous-phrase\">“You should…” is a dangerous phrase</h2>",
  "<p>One of the biggest mistakes a consultant can make is to think that you’re there to give advice and solve client problems. It’s so easy to let this little phrase creep into your work:</p>",
  "<p><em>“You should…”</em></p>",
  "<p>It’s a simple sounding phrase but it gets you in trouble more often than not. It’s problematic for two reasons: it assumes a control of client resources and it’s too prescriptive in form:</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"1-you-should-assumes-you-can-allocate-client-resources\">1. “You should…” assumes you can allocate client resources</h3>",
  "<p>It’s a fundamental mistake to assume that as a consultant we can allocate client resources. We typically don’t have a complete view of everything that the company is working on, we don’t have a detailed understanding of how long things actually take or the full range of dependencies required for them.</p>",
  "<p>Barging into a client saying that they should do something implies a kind of confidence and bravado that can be arrogant at best and ignorant at worst.</p>",
  "<p>Think about the last time you saw a project through from start to finish - the range of complexities, dependencies, hurdles, different work streams and so on required to get it over the finish line are almost certainly missing from the overly-confident and overly-simplistic “You should…”</p>",
  "<p>The simple way that this phrase goes wrong is by under-estimating the <strong>resource complexity</strong> of a task:</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: working with a client where I wanted to re-design a landing page on their site to improve it. Unfortunately I was under-estimating the number of people who need to be involved since the landing pages were still owned by the product team and are technically part of the same codebase as the full tech product. So a “small” change required detailed security scrutiny and QA before going live. Making “simple” changes was not in fact simple at all here.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>But there’s also under-estimating the <strong>political complexity</strong> of the task:</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: working with the NYTimes cooking team I suggested that they should re-tag their content. This kind of “you should…” recommendation seemed straightforward but neglected the political considerations - the team had just spent 6-figures on re-tagging all their recipes - so to ask for further budget to re-do a task they had just done would lose them face internally. A “straightforward” change that actually carried a bunch of political baggage.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Some other types of complexity that you might be under-estimating with regards resource allocation:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>Regulation/compliance complexity</strong> - which either prevents you even doing your recommendation or makes it slower.</li><br />  <li><strong>Technical complexity</strong> - while something might be technically easy, doing it with the client’s existing technology might be hard.</li><br />  <li><strong>Data complexity</strong> - a simple seeming request on the surface (make a landing page for every neighborhood) might actually depend on a robust, maintained data set that doesn’t yet exist.</li><br />  <li><strong>Maintenance complexity</strong> - even if the initial request to create something or do something is not resource intensive, it might come with an implicit agreement to continue to maintain it - expanding the resources allocated.</li><br />  <li><strong>Production complexity</strong> - where what you’re proposing isn’t that expensive or resource intensive to do, but the client (for whatever reason) has a higher quality threshold, making the recommendation more expensive/slower/harder than you anticipated.</li><br />  <li><strong>Narrative complexity</strong> - where what you’re recommending seems reasonable but either the company has tried it before, or a competitor has tried it before or there’s a general sense that “this doesn’t work”. Which can make your recommendation extremely hard to actually get done.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h3 id=\"2-you-should-is-too-prescriptive-in-form\">2. “You should…” is too prescriptive in form</h3>",
  "<p>In addition to under-estimating the problem, we also over-fit the solution. After all, as we saw in the chapter <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/07/18/the-consultants-grain/\">The Consultant’s Grain</a>, as independent consultants we often bias towards our own natural strengths and areas of expertise.</p>",
  "<p>When we say <em>“You should…”</em> we’re essentially offering a problem diagnosis AND a solution at the same time. The consequence of this is that we’re essentially asking the client to accept or reject both together.</p>",
  "<p>Instead, most of your work would be more effective at actually changing clients if you stopped to clearly separate the diagnosis from the solution. If you don’t properly win over all the necessary stakeholders at the client’s side you’re going to face resistance trying to get anything done.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: I was working with Gartner Digital Markets on some SEO strategy and I felt that we needed to work on some more transformative work than simple technical SEO fixes - their core landing pages were offering a worse user experience than the competition and we were losing ground.</p>",
  "  <p>Persuading the rest of the organization that this was a problem wasn’t straightforward. We’d been saying that these pages needed overhauling and it felt like no one was listening. So we ran a small user survey to ask a series of 10 “Google quality rater questions”. This allowed us to present our findings to the senior leadership team at Gartner and I remember showing something like this:</p>",
  "  <p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-19-16-04-03.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "  <p>Instantly, people leaned in around the table and there was a lot of executive interest. Saying something like “we should improve our pages” is too bland and generic - it only serves to win over people who already agree with you. It lacks any kind of rigor or weight to win someone over who already has their own opinions and roadmap.</p>",
  "  <p>In this situation - the survey allowed us to <em>quantify</em> the problem correctly and provided compelling evidence, we didn’t even need to offer a solution! Articulating the problem was enough to convince the necessary teams to take action and prioritize work.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>So if you’re asking <em>“You should…”</em> to the client, stop and examine if you’ve properly defined the situation and provided evidence for the problem, to help the client deeply internalize the problem and win over the necessary stakeholders before you propose any kind of solution.</p>",
  "<p>A good mental exercise to ensure you’re doing the work here is to ask yourself: what happens if the client takes no action? What is the consequence of the current trajectory, or the null case of no investment? This will help you bring some rigor to the question of what the consequence of the problem truly is and allow the problem to be quantified relative to other projects and investment opportunities.</p>",
  "<p>So, what’s the alternative?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"there-is-an-opportunity-to\">“There is an opportunity to…”</h2>",
  "<p>This phrase is the key - it places the focus correctly on first defining the problem - and then providing evidence - before focusing on the solution. It allows us to articulate and quantify the opportunity while leaving room for the client to have say over resource allocation, for the client to shape the solution and for the client to determine prioritization and timing.</p>",
  "<p>Of course in reality, you’re often involved in shaping the solution too - but it’s crucial to ensure that you’re not skipping over the step of clearly defining the size and shape of the opportunity before getting to the solution.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: Working with an ecommerce site to define an SEO strategy part of my recommendation involved investing in content strategy to drive links, traffic and conversions - but before even getting into the shape of the solution, i.e. <em>how</em> we would invest in content it’s important to articulate what the opportunity is.</p>",
  "  <p>By looking at relevant competitors we can estimate the potential traffic and revenue opportunity:</p>",
  "  <p><img src=\"/images/advice-quantified.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "  <p>By showing what’s possible, clients are able to feel more invested in designing the solution with you, rather than just being told what to do.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>This can also be uncomfortable! There are many situations where quantifying the exact opportunity is difficult, requires estimation or requires a different approach (like we saw with the Gartner surveys).</p>",
  "<p>But consider the alternative - the alternative is recommending something to the client… because we say so?</p>",
  "<p>This isn’t necessarily wrong - there’s value in expert opinion - but in my experience clients deeply appreciate you clearly separating out expert opinion and judgment from evidence-based analysis.</p>",
  "<p>As David Maister says in the Trusted Advisor - the best approach is:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>A good process for the advisor to follow is:</p>",
  "  <ol><br />    <li>Give them their options</li><br />    <li>Give them an education about their options (including enough discussion for them to consider each option in depth)</li><br />    <li>Give them a recommendation</li><br />    <li>Let them choose</li><br />  </ol><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This stance essentially allows you as the consultant to own the diagnosis and quantification of the opportunity and then collaboratively with the client to shape the solution and prioritization.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"lets-look-at-the-problem-together\">Let’s look at the problem together</h2>",
  "<p>Taking a collaborative stance with your client is powerful. There are many aspects of consulting that are almost combative by nature - like pointing out problems the client has (that the client was complicit in creating!).</p>",
  "<p>As we saw in the chapter <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/\">Optimism as an Operating System</a>, walking into a client with a critical eye can create a distance between you and the client.</p>",
  "<p>Instead you want to create a kind of shoulder-to-shoulder stance with the client, facing towards the problems together. This creates a much safer, judgment free way to look at the problems (and opportunities) facing the client.</p>",
  "<p>In fact, for senior executives - sometimes you really <em>can’t</em> give them advice - they’re too type-A and overly confident. The only way to convince them is to help them see the problem in a new light - to see things as you see them.</p>",
  "<p>This idea is demonstrated beautifully by Timothy Gallway in The Inner Game of Tennis where he recounts teaching a senior executive how to improve their backhand:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>One day in the summer of 1971 when I was teaching a group of men at John Gardiner’s Tennis Ranch in Carmel Valley, California, a businessman realized how much more power and control he got on his backhand when his racket was taken back below the level of the ball. He was so enthusiastic about his “new” stroke that he rushed to tell his friend Jack about it as if some kind of miracle had occurred. Jack, who considered his erratic backhand one of the major problems of his life, came rushing up to me during the lunch hour, exclaiming, “I’ve always had a terrible backhand. Maybe you can help me.”</p>",
  "  <p>I asked, “What’s so terrible about your backhand?”</p>",
  "  <p>“I take my racket back too high on my backswing.”</p>",
  "  <p>“How do you know?”</p>",
  "  <p>“Because at least five different pros have told me so. I just haven’t been able to correct it.”</p>",
  "  <p>For a brief moment I was aware of the absurdity of the situation. Here was a business executive who controlled large commercial enterprises of great complexity asking me for help as if he had no control over his own right arm. Why wouldn’t it be possible, I wondered, to give him the simple reply, “Sure, I can help you. L-o-w-e-r y-o-u-r r-a-c-k-e-t!”</p>",
  "  <p>But complaints such as Jack’s are common among people of all levels of intelligence and proficiency. Besides, it was clear that at least five other pros had told him to lower his racket without much effect. What was keeping him from doing it? I wondered.</p>",
  "  <p>I asked Jack to take a few swings on the patio where we were standing. His backswing started back very low, but then, sure enough, just before swinging forward it lifted to the level of his shoulder and swung down into the imagined ball. The five pros were right. I asked him to swing several more times without making any comment. “Isn’t that better?” he asked. “I tried to keep it low.” But each time just before swinging forward, his racket lifted; it was obvious that had he been hitting an actual ball, the underspin imparted by the downward swing would have caused it to sail out. “Your backhand is all right,” I said reassuringly. “It’s just going through some changes. Why don’t you take a closer look at it.” We walked over to a large windowpane and there I asked him to swing again while watching his reflection. He did so, again taking his characteristic hitch at the back of his swing, but this time he was astounded. “Hey, I really do take my racket back high! It goes up above my shoulder!” There was no judgment in his voice; he was just reporting with amazement what his eyes had seen.</p>",
  "  <p>What surprised me was Jack’s surprise. Hadn’t he said that five pros had told him his racket was too high? I was certain that if I had told him the same thing after his first swing, he would have replied, “Yes, I know.” But what was now clear was that he didn’t really know, since no one is ever surprised at seeing something they already know. Despite all those lessons, he had never directly experienced his racket going back high. His mind had been so absorbed in the process of judgment and trying to change this “bad” stroke that he had never perceived the stroke itself.</p>",
  "  <p>Looking in the glass which mirrored his stroke as it was, Jack was able to keep his racket low quite effortlessly as he swung again. “That feels entirely different than any backhand I’ve ever swung,” he declared. By now he was swinging up and through the ball over and over again. Interestingly, he wasn’t congratulating himself for doing it right; he was simply absorbed in how different it felt.</p>",
  "  <p>After lunch I threw Jack a few balls and he was able to remember how the stroke felt and to repeat the action. This time he just felt where his racket was going, letting his sense of feel replace the visual image offered by the mirror. It was a new experience for him. Soon he was consistently hitting topspin backhands into the court with an effortlessness that made it appear this was his natural swing. In ten minutes he was feeling “in the groove,” and he paused to express his gratitude. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate what you’ve done for me. I’ve learned more in ten minutes from you than in twenty hours of lessons I’ve taken on my backhand.” I could feel something inside me begin to puff up as it absorbed these “good” words. At the same time, I didn’t know quite how to handle this lavish compliment, and found myself hemming and hawing, trying to come up with an appropriately modest reply. Then, for a moment, my mind turned off and I realized that I hadn’t given Jack a single instruction on his backhand! “But what did I teach you?” I asked. He was quiet for a full half-minute, trying to remember what I had told him. Finally he said, “I can’t remember your telling me anything! You were just there watching, and you got me watching myself closer than I ever had before. Instead of seeing what was wrong with my backhand, I just started observing, and improvement seemed to happen on its own. I’m not sure why, but I certainly learned a lot in a short period of time.” He had learned, but had he been “taught”?</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This is about tennis (is it?) but equally applies to consulting! I find in my own work that senior executives are often blocked by some inability to see what’s actually going on - and that telling them is useless! Instead you need to help them see it for themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Because of their distance from the day to day work, senior executives are especially prone to replacing some version of reality with a compressed narrative. And when this compressed narrative is wrong in some key way you need to return to first principles to show them (not tell them!).</p>",
  "<p>Much like we saw with the example of the Gartner surveys - helping clients see with fresh eyes what’s really going is powerful and can be profoundly useful before you even begin suggesting solutions.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"understanding-the-problem-in-all-of-its-emotional-and-political-complexity\">Understanding the problem in all of its emotional and political complexity</h2>",
  "<p>Once you adopt this collaborative stance with the client you begin to see that the problems as you thought you understood them, are not in fact the full picture.</p>",
  "<p>Your sense of “what’s going on” with a client is intermediated by your point of contact and it turns out that your client is an unreliable narrator. Remember - best case they have problems they’ve been unable to solve on their own, worst case they were actively responsible for creating the problems in the first place!</p>",
  "<p>So it’s no wonder that clients often down-play, mis-represent and mask the full emotional and political complexity of what’s going on. Especially when you first start working together and haven’t yet earned their trust.</p>",
  "<p>But for you to do your job it’s crucial that you get a full picture of what’s really going on. And further, clients deeply appreciate a consultant that can listen and observe closely enough to see what’s really going on.</p>",
  "<p>As David Maister says in <a href=\"https://davidmaister.com/articles/the-consultants-role/\">The Consultant’s Role</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“It can be unsettling to find that the client is primarily interested in having his or her problem understood, in all its emotional and political complexity, as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>What this is saying is that you need to earn the client’s trust in order to be effective at your job. This isn’t at all obvious! When a client comes to you asking for a “content strategy” or support “hiring a VP marketing” it all seems so straightforward, rational and well defined. But as you unpack the layers of the onion you begin to realize why it’s been so hard for the client to help themselves. And that’s when the emotional and political complexity of the problem starts to come into view.</p>",
  "<p>Developing a sensitivity to the emotional and political context of client problems requires an active listening and sensing instinct on behalf of the consultant - to use your own lived experience inside the client’s organization as a way to sense what the inner work life is like inside your client’s business. As Ruth Orenstein says in her book <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Multidimensional_Executive_Coaching/FVHnN1-O-rQC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\">Multidimensional Executive Coaching</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>For the time he/she is present, the consultant becomes part of the multidimensional system, both influencing it and being influenced by it. To do the work of executive coach- ing, then, the consultant must be able to tolerate, and ultimately make use of, entering a highly complex place-a place that is occupied by neither the individual nor the organization alone but, because of their convergence, both the individual and the organization together; a place that contains both the exigencies of working life and the impulses of the psyche; and a place that engages and, in turn, is engaged by the consultant’s own intrapsychic material. In addition, if the work is done effectively, it requires that the consultant be both involved enough in the dynamics so as to experience their impact and detached enough so as to analyze what is transpiring. These demands make imperative the use of oneself as tool.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>Remember: when clients first come to you, your first instinct might be to dismiss the problem as “easily solved”. But you need to hold space to truly consider that the thing that seems easy is, in this particular situation, with this particular client actually not at all easy. And that’s when the work begins.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-next-most-useful-thing\">The Next Most Useful Thing</h2>",
  "<p>This all builds up to my personal consulting mantra: always work on the next most useful thing.</p>",
  "<p>This mantra helps remind me that consulting isn’t about being right, it’s about being useful.</p>",
  "<p>As a consultant - it’s crucial that you’re generating momentum, that clients can <em>feel a sense of progress in your work</em>. A consultant is typically an expensive investment and without a sense of progress or momentum your engagement will stall out.</p>",
  "<p>Importantly however, a sense of progress and momentum doesn’t have to come from the official SOW or project plan. Actual progress is one thing - but a <em>sense of progress</em> is just that - it’s about your client feeling like things are moving forward.</p>",
  "<p>In fact, depending on the project and the client - moving at the expected pace can be too slow! Even after agreeing on a scope, project plan and set of next steps, moving as fast as you said you would can be disappointing to the client.</p>",
  "<p>Remember - building a great client relationship is about trust. And doing the minimum doesn’t build trust. So it’s important to demonstrate to the client that you’re willing to do the extra work, to go a little further, to do the unexpected.</p>",
  "<p>This doesn’t require a ton of extra time but it does require some deliberate effort and sensitivity - to think about the client’s reality - the meetings, projects, pressures they’re facing right now - and think about how you can proactively support them.</p>",
  "<p>You could re-draw the diagram from up above as follows:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/advice-2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Whether your client is facing an important decision, or preparing for a board meeting or working through a bunch of menial tasks - whatever it is there’s typically a way for you to help out in some small way. And in doing so the client feels a sense of momentum and builds a sense of trust between you.</p>",
  "<p>What’s the next most useful thing?</p>",
  "<p>It’s not about ignoring the SOW or the project plan but it’s about recognizing that there’s value in giving your client a sense of momentum.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: I worked with a B2B saas client a few years ago - they were a small startup looking to raise their series B round and we engaged to create a content strategy.</p>",
  "  <p>On this project I made a mistake and despite the fact the client didn’t have any in-house editorial resources I took their request at face value and we structured the project around a 6-week content strategy.</p>",
  "  <p>I delivered what I think is good quality work with a deeply researched and evidence-based 66-page strategy for producing content and…. Nothing happened? They were happy enough with the work product but it didn’t lead to any material change in their strategy or an ongoing consulting relationship.</p>",
  "  <p>In hindsight the key mistake here was not asking myself enough what the next most useful thing was. I think if I’d been more honest about what would add value and show momentum for the client it would have been either a) condensed one or two slide summary of the content opportunity for their fundraising deck and/or b) supporting their VP marketing recruitment effort.</p>",
  "  <p>Perhaps I should have done both. Either way - it turns out that what the client wanted wasn’t really what the client needed and this mismatch led to a fairly unproductive engagement.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Recognizing that clients are unreliable narrators when it comes to scoping projects and defining timelines allows for a more philosophical view of value when it comes to consulting.</p>",
  "<p>Is a 6 week strategy project really the most useful thing the client needs right now? What happens at that point when we have the strategy defined - then what? By seeking more context, clarity and insight into momentum we can more easily work on things that the client will truly appreciate, not just provide things the client asked for.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-conclusion-about-owls\">A Conclusion About Owls</h2>",
  "<p>There’s an internet meme about giving advice that I love. It’s an image that shows you how to draw an owl:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-19-16-44-52.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Too much bad consulting work looks like either step 1 or step 2. Either you’re telling the client <em>“draw some circles”</em> and the client is frustrated the advice is too basic and high level. Or you’re telling the client to <em>“draw the rest of the fucking owl”</em> and are ignoring the detailed reality of the situation and the limitations of teams, resources and capabilities.</p>",
  "<p>Or worse, the client asked you for help drawing owls but what they’re really doing is painting a woodland scene…</p>",
  "<p>Think about this image next time a client comes to you for help drawing owls - your first response shouldn’t be <em>“Oh, that’s easy, first you draw some circles”</em>, it should be <em>“Show me how your owls look today. What do you think is holding you back from drawing better owls? And why is drawing owls important to you right now?”</em></p>",
  "<p>Remember - it’s about adopting a collaborative, trusted stance with clients. And that might require resisting your initial urge to give advice. Instead you need to listen to the full emotional and political situation and then work with the client to re-examine reality in new and surprising ways.</p>",
  "<p>Always work on the next most useful thing. And that doesn’t always involve doing what the client asked for.</p><br />"

I even ran a cohort based course around non-design uses of Figma called <a href=\"https://figmathinkers.com/\">Figma Thinkers</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Much like the underlying javascript technology of ajax ushered in Gmail and with it a whole paradigm of “apps in the browser” I believe that the technical advances in making the open canvas work will usher in a whole new paradigm of canvas-based apps.</p>",

  "<p>I’m such a fanboy that I’d work with Figma on anything ha. But here’s a few ideas:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Exploring non-design / non-product use cases for Figma. What if we built a new team inside Figma that aimed at winning over McKinsey and all the big consulting firms to use Figma day to day. What would that look like? How would the product need to evolve? How might we open up a whole new segment of the market?</li><br />  <li>How can we do more interesting, adventurous editorial projects? Inspired by <a href=\"https://press.stripe.com/\">Stripe press</a> and <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/IV5AGF2aV75vau327SUKSy/CRYPTO-PHILANTHROPY?node-id=0%3A1&amp;utm_source=figmathinkers&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=figma-thinkers-week-8-creative-figma-uses\">Figma essays</a>. How might we explore a wider, more creative range of publishing and editorial projects to show off what Figma can do?</li><br />  <li>From an SEO perspective, Canva has done a masterful job with templates, tools and content designed for SEO and gets… <em>checks notes</em>… about 3400% more Google traffic<sup id=\"fnref:figma\"><a href=\"#fn:figma\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. What would the Figma equivalent SEO play be here?</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"replit\">Replit</h2>",
  "<p>Tinkering with the web is a foundational part of my identity. I’ve called this <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/\">digital bricolage</a> before. I’m not a real developer, just like I’m not a real designer and yet I build things on Replit all the time!</p>",
  "<p>I’m a huge advocate for tools that lower the bar to entry for more users and help people expand what they think is possible. Couple that with a deep frustration at how most developer tools on board users (see: <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2021/01/14/new-browsers/\">why can’t I code inside my browser</a>) and Replit is a dream client.</p>",
  "<p>I recently built a little bookmarklet and app for a client using Replit that gave an x-ray vision overlay on their website with a bunch of custom analysis and stats - took me a few hours to prototype and opened up a bunch of interesting conversations! I love that kind of thing.</p>",
  "<p>So how might we work together? Some ideas:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Replit has a real search problem - if you search for examples and templates on Google you get stuck in a list of Replit pages that look the same, with many of them being low-quality. There’s a crawling, architecture and internal linking strategy here to dramatically improve the ability for people to find high quality Replit examples and templates.</li><br />  <li>You can import Github repos directly into Replit which feels like magic when it works! Except it’s very hard to know if it’s going to work ahead of time. I think there are opportunities here around better messaging / workflows / community standards to help people better understand whether a github repo can be imported directly into Replit, and if so how to do it.</li><br />  <li>The education play on Replit seems very successful with the 100 days of code in particular. I’d love to expand this idea into potentially more cohort-based models of building projects. Less “learn to code” and more “build something interesting, together”.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"remarkable\">Remarkable</h2>",
  "<p>I bought a Remarkable tablet last year and it really changed my daily knowledge work. It’s a beautiful product that feels like a joy to use. It’s also directly led to me reading a <em>lot</em> more PDFs and academic papers - it’s such a perfect form factor for loading up a PDF and reading/annotating - deep focus work away from my other screens.</p>",
  "<p>At the same time - it’s clearly still early in the “e-ink screen” world, it feels kind of like when I got my first Sonos product 12 years ago. Such a leap forward ahead of everything else but also kind of clunky, we’re still working our way through what this technology can and should do and how we interact with it.</p>",
  "<p>Some things I’d love to work with Remarkable on:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>They’ve done a great job with Instagram content - it’s polished, engaging and clearly converts for them. But remarkable.com is somewhat neglected in terms of content. There’s a big opportunity to really take the web seriously and build an evergreen content library - both to show off the product and to do a better job on the product education and support side.</li><br />  <li>When I’m working on my laptop I keep my Remarkable right next to me but this “passive second screen” use case is completely unexplored. I’d love to work through how you could enable new modes of working - what could you use your e-ink second screen for? There are all kinds of <a href=\"https://github.com/dennisreimann/kindle-display\">kindle jailbreak</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/speedyg0nz/MagInkCal\">raspberry pi examples</a> of second-screens and displays that I think the Remarkable would be perfect for.</li><br />  <li>While generally the Remarkable UX and interactions are well thought through there are a variety of things that would be fun to prototype and play with for example double-tap the power button to take a screenshot, or an “send this” action when you select a region.</li><br />  <li>I’d love to explore different workflows and innovations around web &lt;–&gt; remarkable workflows for saving, reading, sharing content between the browser and the device. There’s lots of unexplored uses here.</li><br /></ul>",

  "<p>Beyond just the feed though, LinkedIn is a social product that actually has a core utility! The value of a professional profile actually has value, distinct from other social sites.</p>",
  "<p>I’d love to work with LinkedIn on:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Positioning LinkedIn as a personal learning environment. Not just “LinkedIn learning” though that’s part of it - but actually everything on LinkedIn culminates in learning - the feed, your network, education content and more. There’s so much unexplored possibility around social learning environments, just-in-time learning, credentialing and more.

I’m not an expert in the AI technology but after working in search for almost 20 years there are a bunch of things that I think we can learn about how people search and searcher behavior that would be relatively easy to build and would help turn these from niche, single-purpose search engines into more complete general-purpose search engines.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>User research studies that focus on people’s searching behavior. Since we’re building something new this isn’t straightforward but I still believe that grounding in user research is useful and would uncover some smaller things that might change user adoption and retention.</li><br />  <li>Benchmarking the user experience of key user journeys against other search tools to better understand where the product excels. One of the defining ideas is that <em>teams don’t know what they’ve built</em> - as Matt Webb says with AI we’re in a <a href=\"https://interconnected.org/home/2023/11/24/digestion\">capability overhang</a>. Or to say another way, we’re in a product marketing overhang - we don’t even know how good the product is that we’ve built!</li><br />  <li>Brand exploration and user messaging to figure out how to educate and convert people into a new daily behavior.

  "<p>The identity and labels you create for yourself as an independent consultant are tricky things. They’re not fixed but they sure do seem to carry some mystical weight. If we go around calling ourselves a UX designer one week and a storyteller in residence another week we’re going to suffer a kind of internal angst, or vertigo.</p>",
  "<p>When you have a job - your work label is given to you. Anyone can go see it on your LinkedIn page. <em>“Product manager at Salesforce”</em> or <em>“Head of marketing at Etsy”</em>. These labels are very clearly defined - and they mean something - “product manager” and “head of marketing” are legible and transferable between companies, they convey a shared sense of knowledge, expertise, seniority, salary and more.</p>",
  "<p>But when you step out on your own….</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-14-38-55.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>LinkedIn doesn’t know what to do with you. Freelance strategy consultant employed by tomcritchlow.com…? Sure I guess?</p>",
  "<p>You might think this is a surface level problem - haha ok so LinkedIn doesn’t know how to deal with me. No biggie - LinkedIn is garbage anyway right.</p>",
  "<p>Except… the power of labels isn’t for others, the power of labels is for ourselves.</p>",
  "<p>Good labels give us the power to charge money, they give us confidence and energy. While bad labels can cause psychic anguish and self-sabotage.</p>",
  "<p>When you step out on your own into the world of independence, you’re suddenly responsible for your own label. For the self employed indie consultant swapping out identities can be as easy as changing the words on LinkedIn or rewriting your landing page.</p>",
  "<p>We’re simply not designed to switch our sense of identity so quickly or easily.</p>",
  "<p>In part 1 we’ll look at choosing the labels you use - dealing with the disorienting and uncomfortable questions about who you believe you are, who we want to become and how much you believe your own bullshit.</p>",
  "<p>In part 2 we’ll look at evolving and growing your sense of identity over time. Untethered from the world of pay rises, promotions and job titles, how do you create a sense of progress and personal growth?</p>",
  "<h1 id=\"part-1-narrative-aircover\">Part 1: Narrative Aircover</h1>",
  "<p>A defining characteristic of the internet is to rewrite the rules of permission and institutions. This means that the way that identities are formed is changing too - how they are generated, shaped, validated and sustained all change because of the internet.</p>",
  "<p>The old world is full of gatekeepers to impress - but the networked age radically changes the game. It changes who gets to give permission and which parts require permission at all. Now, in 2024, we’re firmly in an era of permissionless identities.</p>",
  "<p>It’s no longer sufficient to rely on existing authority and institutions to create your labels - instead you need to create and tend to your own labels.</p>",
  "<p>For independents you feel this acutely when you first step out on your own - how do you describe the work that you do? How do you describe who you are? But no matter the labels and language you choose, to begin with it’s going to be made up. You don’t yet have enough of a track record, client history or confidence in who you are or who you will become to state anything with certainty.</p>",
  "<p>And in fact, this is a good thing! This leaping into the chaos of the unknown is one of the things that <strong><em>attracts</em></strong> weirdos, fools and generalists towards the independent lifestyle in the first place.</p>",
  "<p>The first year or two of independent consulting are typically a swirling mixture of trying on labels for size. Are you a product manager? Consultant? Freelancer? Innovation designer? Copywriter? Strategist? Brand strategist? No-code guru?</p>",
  "<p>These labels are going to swirl around you and I’m going to tell you that it’s ok to thrash around for a while - try labels on for size. Create new ones! Discard old ones! Come back to the ones you discarded before!</p>",
  "<p>As Herminia Ibarra says in the wonderful book <a href=\"https://herminiaibarra.com/working-identity-book/\">Working Identity</a>, the dangerous thing is to clutch too tightly to a singular introspective idea of “Who am I?”. Instead Herminia suggests we should adopt a more iterative, playful idea of “who could I become?”:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“How do we move forward and reinvent ourselves when our very selves have been so shaken? For starters, we must reframe the questions, abandoning the conventional career-advice queries—“Who am I?”—in favor of more open-ended alternatives—“Among the many possible selves that I might become, which is most intriguing to me now? Which is easiest to test?” Getting started depends on whether we are looking to find our one true self or whether, instead, we are trying to test and evaluate possible alternatives.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This process of becoming is entirely natural and in fact can be generative - leading to new ideas.</p>",
  "<p>But this thrashing and cycling through labels can be psychologically exhausting too. For those around us - and for ourselves - how do we maintain some sense of stability in the chaos?</p>",
  "<p>The answer is not to hide our consulting identity, but to protect it and give it some shelter while it’s still emerging. Enter narrative aircover.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"narrative-aircover\">Narrative Aircover</h2>",
  "<p>When I quit my last job almost 10 years ago, I didn’t know that I’d end up doing so much consulting work, or that I’d end up identifying so strongly with the label “independent consultant”.</p>",
  "<p>It turns out when I quit my job I was actually trying to build an art startup with my partner: Fiercely Curious. You can see from this email exchange that <a href=\"https://www.fiercelycurious.com/\">Fiercely Curious</a> is the primary label and identity I’m using:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-14-41-34.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>It took about 9-12 months of juggling some consulting work and building an art startup to realize that:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Consulting pays far better than building an art startup (who knew!)</li><br />  <li>I actually enjoyed consulting</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>This was about the time that I decided to go “all in” on consulting, to start using that label and identify that way. Importantly by that stage I’d had 4-5 solid consulting projects and had some confidence that “consultant” meant something more than just “unemployed freelancer”.</p>",
  "<p>This was all kind of accidental but in hindsight incredibly valuable - the ability to lean on Fiercely Curious as a project with some kind of substance allowed me to show up in the world, to have conversations with people, to network, to tell people what I was up to.</p>",
  "<p>All while I muddled my way through becoming a consultant.</p>",
  "<p>That’s why I call this “narrative aircover” because it provides shelter and protection to the emerging identity while it’s still incredibly fragile.</p>",
  "<p>In my case, my narrative aircover was in the shape of an art business. In your case it could be an online food magazine, or a meetup event series, or a podcast.</p>",
  "<p>The key thing for narrative aircover is that it’s expansive, passionate and unblocked.</p>",
  "<p>I think the following characteristics are most useful for narrative aircover to provide you value in the early stages of starting a consulting business:</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"1-expansive-to-grow-your-surface-area\">1. Expansive to grow your surface area</h3>",
  "<p>While our consulting identity is small and fragile it can be easy to close up - to adopt a stance of safety. “Who am I to talk about being a consultant, I barely have any clients!” or “What do I have to say on LinkedIn, I’m not even working right now!”.</p>",
  "<p>But growing and nurturing your network is essential to building a long term sustainable indie consulting career so in the early days it’s important to do things that open you up - open you up to opportunities, connections, conversations and clients. So you need to pick something that’s expansive - something that opens you up to invite connection.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: When Vicky Gu went out as an independent brand and content strategist - she leaned on narrative aircover of her online food magazine <a href=\"https://staycurrant.com/\">Currant</a>. There, she is able to describe herself as a “managing editor” (see how easy it is to award yourself labels in a permissionless world!).</p>",
  "  <p>Currant is expansive - it is a way in for Vicky to have conversations with chefs, restaurant owners, writers, designers and all sorts of other folks in the making of a digital publication. But it’s also expansive in the sense that through sharing editorial pieces about food, she can reach new audiences.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>The idea that your narrative aircover is something that can invite people to lean in allows you to easily have new conversations with new people and expand your surface area. Whether it’s an email list, event series or non-profit.</p>",
  "<p>You want a project that opens doors - something that gives you an excuse to be public, visible and interesting. Building something that is a permission tool to give yourself permission to reach out to people, to meet people for coffee, to connect and to build your network.</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"2-passionate-to-show-off-your-vibes\">2. Passionate to show off your vibes</h3>",
  "<p>As we saw in <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/03/12/strange-attraction/\">Strange Attraction</a>, the value of your network comes from all kinds of weird and wonderful places - it isn’t always the people you would expect. And as we saw in <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/16/rejecting-specialization/\">Rejecting Specialization</a> to secure senior level projects you need to expose your vibes.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s important to have something <em>interesting</em> that you can talk about. My art startup is a great conversation starter - a lot of people are interested in art and culture. Just like lots of people are interested in Vicky’s food magazine.</p>",
  "<p>Launching a narrative aircover project that is inherently aligned with your passions will help ensure that people are paying attention, leaning in and taking your meetings.</p>",
  "<h3 id=\"3-unblocked-so-its-within-your-control\">3. Unblocked so it’s within your control</h3>",
  "<p>Finally, you want your narrative aircover project to be more under your own control than consulting work. One of the primary problems to solve is that you likely don’t currently have a lot of consulting work to rely on or talk about - you’re dependent on clients to move things forward.</p>",
  "<p>So you want your narrative aircover project to be <strong>alive by default</strong> - not blocked and relying on others to move forward but something that you can move forward under your own steam. Even a humble blog can fit the requirements here - free to publish as and when you want without any kind of gatekeepers or dependencies on others.</p>",
  "<p>In summary - indie consultants are creatures of momentum and narrative aircover is how you get started. It’s about creating activation energy in your network to start making something happen - because without that you’re going to just sit there and worry about finding clients.</p>",
  "<p>Narrative aircover isn’t about hiding our consulting identity - it’s about not leaning on it too hard during the early days when it’s most fragile and still evolving.</p>",
  "<p>Narrative aircover provides you meaning, labels, safety and permission to engage with people while you’re figuring things out during the first year or so of your journey.</p>",
  "<h1 id=\"part-2-compound-narrative\">Part 2: Compound Narrative</h1>",
  "<p>Eventually, at some point down the road you will successfully manage to generate revenue, find clients and build a consulting practice that <em>works</em> - your next problem is figuring out how to make it sustainable.</p>",
  "<p>Understandably - so much of your focus in the first few years of setting up your practice is on consistently generating clients. That is after all the most important thing you need. One client after another. Line em up.</p>",
  "<p>But at some point you can end up stuck - feeling like every client is simply another spin of the hamster wheel. Trapped in your own constraints of client work you’re feeling like there’s a never-ending series of client projects on the treadmill. A feeling that every client is starting from zero again.</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-14-57-47.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<div class=\"tc f5 i\">The never-ending treadmill of client work</div>",
  "<p>One of the biggest downsides of consulting is that there’s nothing passive about the revenue - nothing compounds. To pay rent each month you have to keep generating clients.</p>",
  "<p>This is why, once you reach some stability with consistently generating clients and revenue, many indie consultants begin to think about “scaling themselves” - either in the form of hiring staff or in building “passive income” products.</p>",
  "<p>This reflex isn’t bad per se but it’s important to recognize that they are avoiding the real problem. They are avoidance of dealing with the root issue of actually enjoying your consulting work. Of finding a way to value and enjoy client work over long periods of time.</p>",
  "<p>Some of the things we’ve talked about in the book can help you enjoy your work: shifting to strategic clients helps keep the work interesting and focusing on being impactful helps the work feel meaningful. But at some point it can start to feel like a grind.</p>",
  "<p>The problem is that outside of the constraints and norms of full time work, a defined career and job progression - there’s no simple measure for professional advancement.</p>",
  "<p>No one is paying for training, no one is sending you to conferences. No one is giving you a promotion or a new job title.</p>",
  "<p>So you have to find your own personal growth plan - a way to both find intrinsic meaning in growth and development and in externally visible progress towards being “more senior” and able to move upwards inside client organizations. Otherwise you’ll stagnate, your earnings will plateau and your public image will stall out.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"fitting-every-client-into-a-narrative-frame\">Fitting every client into a narrative frame</h2>",
  "<p>The trick here is to use each client as a compound build on the last one, not simply another go around the treadmill.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: In my own work - in year 2, after finding some routine in generating clients and steady work - a friend asked for advice on going out on their own, so I wrote up a blog post with some thoughts. That blog post generated a few more blog posts about the practice of independent consulting and before you know it I was writing this book (a project that would creatively sustain me with compound narrative for the next 6+ years!)</p>",
  "  <p>The trick is that every new client isn’t simply a chance to do the same thing but it’s a chance to deepen my perspective and experience on the practice of independent consulting. Every client can teach you something.</p>",
  "  <p>Now I gleefully look forward to new clients because I know they can become stories and examples for my book project.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>I call this idea <strong>compound narrative</strong>. You need some way to feel like every client builds on the last one - that you’re left starting from somewhere new, not starting from the same place every time.</p>",
  "<p>Then - the trick is to view every single client, no matter how “boring” or “routine” or “straightforward” on the surface - as being part of that compound narrative. What insights or evidence can you gather towards your questions through this client project?</p>",
  "<p>Niko Canner calls this “<a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade\">mastery of a larger game</a>”:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>The medium to do this larger work was in writing. In my prior chapter as a founder, building Katzenbach Partners, I’d never given myself much space to write, because that had never felt as important to my goals as the work of entrepreneurial leadership, rainmaking and advising clients. <strong>I needed to change that, and to recognize that writing would be my vehicle for reaching toward greater mastery of a larger game. Writing wasn’t in service of building an audience or building a business. Writing as a learning practice was an end in itself</strong>.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>This might seem straightforward but the subtle trick is choosing a narrative frame that you’re <strong><em>actually interested in</em></strong>. For example, if you’re a digital PR consultant - the obvious learning frame for your work would be to learn about the practice of digital PR. Sure, this makes sense - except perhaps you’re not really interested in the idea of “digital PR” - it’s too broad and doesn’t have any kind of hook to it.</p>",
  "<p>The trick is to find a frame that lights up your curiosity - perhaps something like “how digital PR is evolving as new social platforms emerge” or “how companies measure the effectiveness of digital PR” or “why digital PR doesn’t get a seat at the executive table”.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"finding-the-right-learning-questions\">Finding the Right Learning Questions</h2>",
  "<p>Notice that these narrative frames are all open ended questions that possess a measure of <strong>specific curiosity</strong>. These narrative frames can be far more interesting by virtue of being more specific.</p>",
  "<p>Questions are powerful tools for shaping your thinking and perspective. Finding good questions can sustain and nourish your curiosity and help you feel alive. They’re the antidote to burnout and stagnation.</p>",
  "<p>But how do you find good questions?</p>",
  "<p>A great place to start is to write down a list of questions that you don’t know the answer to. Questions that might not even have an easy answer. Questions that you can explore over an extended period of time.</p>",
  "<p>The community Huddlecraft calls these <a href=\"https://medium.com/huddlecraft/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904\">learning questions</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.</p>",
  "  <p>Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.</p>",
  "  <p>Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<p>And they have this lovely 2x2 framework with examples of learning questions:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/2024-01-09-15-00-51.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>This 2x2 framework feels right - if you write down 10 ideas for learning questions, you’ll be able to plot them (subjectively) on this 2x2 graph. It’s not that every single learning question needs to be impossible to answer and open ended, but those questions are going to be the ones with the most potential to nourish and sustain your practice for the longest.</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>Example: Behzod Sirjani is an independent consultant with a deep background in user research. To sustain his practice he has been researching and publishing OAE - a learning question around <a href=\"https://behzod.com/oae\">organizations as ecosystems</a>:</p>",
  "  <blockquote><br />    <p>“Organizations as Ecosystems” is a research and writing project about the ways that organizations sense, react, learn, and change. Some outputs of this project will be regular essays and a corresponding set of readings and references.</p><br />  </blockquote>",
  "  <p>This is a perfect open ended and impossible to fully answer. It’s easy to see how this question could sustain years of client work, where each client is an opportunity to explore and deepen your understanding of the question of how companies sense, react, learn and change.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>Finding the right set of learning questions is incredibly powerful because it turns your consulting practice into a sustainable practice. It enables you to stay in the work for long multi-year periods. Because you have to stay in the work - if you’re an independent consultant there’s no one to do the work for you - no employees, no colleagues to lean on. So you have to stay in the work.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"compound-thinking--publishing\">Compound Thinking &amp; Publishing</h2>",
  "<p>The magical thing about finding questions you’re interested in and pursuing them for a while is that you end up with interesting things to say.</p>",
  "<p>As you deepen your understanding of the questions you’re interested in you find that these projects turn into generative and useful objects</p>",
  "<div class=\"example\"><br />  <p>For example, here’s John V Willshire back in 2015 talking about the famous “<a href=\"https://smithery.com/2015/01/07/three-2015-projects/\">Smithery Projects</a>” that he embarks on each year:</p>",
  "  <blockquote><br />    <p>“Ah, the famous annual Smithery projects. Well, famous might be pushing it, let’s go with ‘the thing that we do at the start of each year’. 2012 was about Making, 2013 was about Media, and 2014 was about Playing With Ideas, which in hindsight remained gloriously ill-defined but gave rise to August’s Culture Matrix malarkey, so we’ll let it off.”</p><br />  </blockquote>",
  "  <p>One of those projects eventually turned into a delightful foundational framework and approach called <a href=\"https://smithery.com/2020/12/01/starting-with-zenko-mapping/\">Zenko mapping</a> that is core to how Smithery operates.</p><br /></div>",
  "<p>It’s part of why publishing is such a rich pursuit for indie consultants - it’s a culmination and focus on the act of <strong><em>accumulated insights</em></strong>. Turning your compound narrative into a published artefact is incredibly powerful - it positions you as an expert, builds an audience and is incredibly satisfying!</p>",
  "<p>There’s a rich vein of self-publishing by indie consultants:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The ux consultant writing <a href=\"https://4dthinking.studio/ux-book\">a book about UX design</a>.</li><br />  <li>The designer writing <a href=\"https://shapeofdesignbook.com/\">a book about design</a>.</li><br />  <li>The security consultant publishing <a href=\"https://www.spartan9.com/publications/crisis-simulations.html\">emergency extraction guides</a>.</li><br />  <li>The ethnographic researcher publishing <a href=\"https://www.thefieldstudyhandbook.com/\">the fieldguide to ethnographic research</a>.</li><br />  <li>The indie consultant publishing the book about independent consulting (coming soon!)</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>But it doesn’t have to be a book - publishing in all its forms can be an email newsletter, it can be a podcast, it can be a zine, it can be a research report.</p>",
  "<p>Any of these can work and in fact the ongoing nature of something like a podcast can help sustain an interest by becoming a vehicle not for promoting, but for learning! For <strong>continually being interested in the work you’re doing</strong>.</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/compound-learning.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>And if you do it all correctly, the sky’s the limit as April Dunford, author of Obviously Awesome, <a href=\"https://podcast.creatorscience.com/april-dunford/\">will testify</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>“Getting the book out was absolutely transformational to the business. Like, that’s what took me from, this is a good business that pays me more than what my salary was in house, you know, yay me, consultant, to holy man. I didn’t even think it was possible to make this kind of money and work with this kind of clients and do this amazing stuff. And, yeah, the book was a game changer.”</p><br /></blockquote>",
  "<h2 id=\"in-summary\">In Summary</h2>",
  "<p>The challenge of managing your own identity - free from any constraints and expectations of full time work - can be a surprising challenge. Realizing that you can be whoever you want to be comes with a sense of being untethered. Navigating that narrative journey requires anchoring ourselves to things - whether it’s narrative aircover of a self-directed project or the compound narrative of learning questions.</p>",
  "<p>And eventually, once you find a generative set of questions to explore, it can sustain an independent consulting practice for years - helping you generate interesting clients, enjoy every new client and build a sense of personal growth and progression.</p><br />"

  "<h2 id=\"i-just-fing-love-consulting\">I just f*(&amp;^)ing LOVE consulting</h2>",
  "<p>One of the things that emerged out of my work with my executive coach was a reminder that I really, truly love consulting work.</p>",
  "<p>There are many indie consultants that like the lifestyle and freedoms it affords, but don’t actually love the client work itself - but I’ve worked so hard over the last 9 years to both attract the right kinds of clients and to hone my approach to working with clients that client work energizes me and lights me up.</p>",
  "<p>More please, I love it.</p>",
  "<p>At the root of this is the idea of consulting being a <strong>conversation with clients</strong>. Niko Canner articulates this beautifully in his piece:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"On%20Human%20Enterprise%20%7C%20One%20Moment%20in%20a%20Decade\" data-author=\"Niko Canner\" cite=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade\"><br /><p>I’d gone back to consulting because I loved doing my work in conversation: both the real-time exchange of ideas and the way that writing down my thoughts for clients created the opportunity for a slower, more extended form of dialogue. Those were practices to deepen every day.</p><br /><footer>@humanenterprise <cite><a href=\"https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade\">https://www.onhumanenterprise.com/one-moment-in-a-decade</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>At one point I think I felt like perhaps my consulting chapter was waning or winding down as I focused on courses and whatnot. But this conversation with clients is too deeply rooted. I think I’ll be doing some version of consulting for the next 20 years. You have no idea how exciting that is to write.</p>",
  "<p>What did consulting work look like this year? Here’s a few vignettes:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>After reading Cedric’s blog post series on <a href=\"https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/\">becoming more data driven</a> and in particular the Amazon Weekly Business Review - I worked with a long term client to create a Monthly Business Review (MBR) packet that has a TON of charts and data in it. The CEO now carries it around with him at all times - scribbling notes in the margins and I love it.</li><br />  <li>As mentioned last year - most of my work is now <strong><em>P&amp;L first</em></strong> which really means that the primary context I’m considering work through is a resource-constrained and financial perspective. This is a continuation of the idea that’s powered my entire consulting career: how to do effective consulting work. Good ideas are worthless if you can’t get them done.</li><br />  <li>Working with <a href=\"https://directiveconsulting.com/\">Directive Consulting</a> on their branding and positioning was very rewarding - Garrett the CEO is an amazing operator with a deep understanding of his own P&amp;L and this positioning work wasn’t just words, it was designed to change the whole delivery cycle from marketing and sales through to operations.</li><br />  <li>I dabbled with some executive coaching - but the biggest realization here is that I’m too much of a consultant to be a pure coach - I want to be like a performance coach, working directly with individuals and executive teams on management performance. My ideal client would be running a management team weekly meeting - getting more operational than coaching typically allows.</li><br />  <li>Surprisingly, I’ve ended up integrating design work into my consulting offering. I’ve ended up designing new page templates, product experiences, landing pages, keynote presentations and more. Design isn’t the main thing people are paying me for but I’m starting to take design more seriously as as thing that I can deliver as part of a strategic project.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Looking ahead to the new year - obviously AI is going to dominate the conversation. I’m involved in a few very interesting client projects around AI and it feels like clients are finally starting to realize they need to get started, you can’t hang around waiting for others to figure it out for you…</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"from-seo-mba---new-mba\">From SEO MBA -&gt; NEW MBA</h2>",
  "<p>At the start of the year I ran a live cohort for the SEO MBA. It was…. fine? The people that went through the experience absolutely loved it, but the cohort was smaller than I wanted it to be and I overloaded the schedule so it was quite exhausting to run.</p>",
  "<p>Partly because of this and partly because of a general desire to broaden and expand the ideas in the SEO MBA I went into hibernation mode. Out of that emerged a new idea - it’s an evolution of the SEO MBA brand, but designed for a much broader audience:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/newmba-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"https://newmba.co/\">NEW MBA</a> is already deeply rewarding and generative. The ability to sit with ideas around business, management and leadership that I’ve been playing around with on the SEO MBA is very exciting. The aspiration here is to reach a much bigger audience with the ideas - and to align the writing and courses more directly with my consulting work.</p>",
  "<p>There aren’t (yet) any courses and classes on the NEW MBA but all of that is coming this year so watch this space. Just like my consulting, I think I can commit to the NEW MBA idea for the next 20 years.</p>",
  "<p>This project is live, but actually is in a kind of “soft launch” state - because there’s something I’ve gotta do first….</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"a-winter-of-word-craft-the-book-is-coming\">A Winter of Word Craft: The book is coming!</h2>",
  "<p>My close friend Brian created a little book of collected testimonials and blurbs for my book and handed it to me on my 40th birthday party. It floored me. I cried. You are the best Brian. And thank you to everyone who included a blurb. The overwhelming support for the book is a real driving force and I love you all.</p>",
  "<p>The good news is that <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/\">the book</a> is coming! I’ve been jamming with fellow indie consultant Tim Casasola on the outline and structure for the book and I think I’m finally arrived at somewhere I’m happy with. But/and I’ve realized that actually getting this book over the finishing line is going to require a period of focused effort and dedication.</p>",
  "<p>My good friend Toby wrote an incredibly moving and lovely December note where he talked about naming seasons and intention setting:</p>",

  "<p>I’ve used the metaphor of a road trip before to describe being an indie consultant. I’ve always imagined it like driving around in a car. But perhaps after almost 10 years it’s time to expand my ways of being in the world. Moving through the world not on wheels but on wings.</p>",

  "<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice is a lot of small bubbles gathering on the surface of the pot. Is that boiling? The water’s not that hot yet; you can still even stick your finger in. Then the bubbles will appear faster and start rising, but they somehow seem ‘unboiling’. Then you’ll start to see little bubble storms in patches, and you start to hear a hissing noise.

  "<p>It turns out there are no “simple” concepts. There’s a surprising amount of detail all around us.</p>",
  "<p>I’d argue that this is a useful mental model for consultants working with clients. (Is the client changing? Sort of? It doesn’t really <em>look</em> like they’re changing): <strong>clients have a surprising amount of detail</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>The idea of providing “recommendations” to a client is like saying “now boil some water” - sometimes this is fine, but oftentimes you’ll find that this advice is insufficient to handle the day to day ambiguity and complexity of tiny streams of bubbles and sort of, kind of boiling water…</p>",
  "<p>So how do you create a strategy when there are infinite details? Well, spoiler alert, it’s hard! It’s why the model of “strategy and stewardship” from the Helsinki Design Lab has been so foundational for my own consulting practice:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Legible Practices\" data-author=\"Helsinki Design Lab\" cite=\"http://helsinkidesignlab.rip/peoplepods/themes/hdl/downloads/Legible_Practises.pdf\"><br />We invoke stewardship in place of words like “implement” and “execute” out of recognition that the latter imply a cleanliness or linear progression which is rarely found when working on a shared proposition in a complex environment. Inside a factory plans can be executed, orders implemented, and outcomes delivered, but innovations that engage with the messy reality of the social sphere do not happen so neatly.<div><br /></div><div>What we describe also goes well beyond “facilitation,” which suggests that others do the important work. Stewardship<br />shapes the course of innovation; it is not a neutral role.</div><div><br /></div><div>Think of stewardship as a form of leadership. One that<br />acknowledges things will change along the way for better or for worse, therefore demanding agility over adherence to a predetermined plan. Many individuals who work in alliances or collaborative endeavors act as stewards almost naturally. If you are used to continually calibrating the goals of a project with the constraints of your context, you are practicing stewardship. If you maintain a constant state of opportunism and a willingness to pivot when progress on the current path is diminishing, you’re a natural steward.</div><br /><footer>Helsinki Design Lab<cite> <a href=\"http://helsinkidesignlab.rip/peoplepods/themes/hdl/downloads/Legible_Practises.pdf\">http://helsinkidesignlab.rip/peoplepods/themes/hdl/downloads/Legible_Practises.pdf</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>The idea of the consultant making a set of recommendations (or a strategy deck) and then walking away is simply a poor model of consulting. Clients don’t want this model, and you don’t want to see your recommendations sit on a shelf either.</p>",
  "<p>Instead the goal is to find a way to get involved in the strategy AND the stewardship. To embrace the idea that “execution” work can be a form of leadership. To roll up your sleeves, do the dirty work, manage the project, grapple with the details.</p>",
  "<p>A good reminder any time, but especially in these economic times, clients want consultants that will actually DO something. Consultants that will help ideas, strategy and recommendations actually come to life.</p>",

  "<p>Most of my consulting work connects to “marketing strategy” in some way - clients come wanting to talk about growing their business. But the funny thing about growth and marketing is that each component is like a thread that, once pulled, unravels the whole spool.</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Struggling with distribution? How’s your analytics?</li><br />  <li>Struggling with SEO? How’s your product?</li><br />  <li>Struggling with content? How’s your narrative?</li><br />  <li>Struggling with margin? How’s your sales?</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Every question seems to open up an interconnected mess.</p>",
  "<p>It’s why I start every consulting engagement asking 1,000 questions. I’m trying to understand the context of the client environment, trying to see how all the threads are interconnected.</p>",
  "<p>So it’s been fun recently to do a few projects that look like a “full business review” where I work with a team on strategy, but <strong>explicitly putting the whole business on the table as context</strong>. I’m thinking about scaling up and formalizing this offering so I’ve been musing about where the value is for these sessions, what clients want, and where clients get stuck.</p>",
  "<p>The format for these business review sessions today is:</p><br /><ul><br />  <li>Initial exploratory kickoff to align on objectives</li><br />  <li>Prep work to get up to speed with the quirks of the business and review existing data and documents</li><br />  <li>Two-day workshop (in a remote world typically spread over 3-4 sessions)</li><br />  <li>A summary presentation that captures the key ideas from the workshop</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Given my background, these sessions typically focus on growth, but the nice thing about expanding the frame from a typical consulting engagement is we deliberately put everything on the table: operations, process, people, funding etc. It’s useful to try and look at the business as a whole so that when we get into the weeds with a particular problem (which we inevitably do) we can keep the broader business context in mind.</p>",
  "<p>It’s surprising how useful this broader company context is - I get the impression that most leadership teams really don’t give themselves permission to zoom in and out from macro to micro in the same session - and this causes a lot of bad decision making.</p>",
  "<p>The tension of course with these workshop sessions is that “strategy” and “roadmaps” are abstract concepts and not particularly useful. What can you accomplish in a two-day session that has real value for a client?</p>",
  "<p>In early conversations with clients we usually settle on “prioritization” as the tangible output, as in - we’ll come out of the two days with “a prioritized roadmap” or a “set of strategic priorities”.</p>",
  "<p>The reality is a bit messier than that - the value from the session typically ends up a mixture of: clarity around the big picture, combined with a few very specific key breakthroughs which unlock immediate action on projects.</p>",
  "<p>This could be a useful insight around content distribution, or an insight about SEO success, or an insight around job responsibility for an upcoming hire, or a key way to separate or integrate different business units.</p>",
  "<p>In the end, prioritization isn’t really the useful thing.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"the-roadmap-is-not-the-territory\">The roadmap is not the territory</h2>",
  "<p>Prioritization sounds concrete but isn’t actually that interesting. Clients already know roughly what to do - and have a prioritized roadmap already. So what’s the problem?</p>",
  "<p>The challenge facing the client is typically some underlying feeling that what is currently on the roadmap today won’t prepare them correctly for tomorrow’s future. There’s a belief that they need to <strong>do things differently</strong> or <strong>do new things</strong> to prepare for the changing future.</p>",
  "<p>The real challenge typically ends up being <strong>“how do we invest in doing NEW things, given our existing prioritized roadmap?”</strong>. The client is looking at an existing roadmap, trying to add brand new things to it and so imagines that a new version of the prioritized roadmap is what they need.</p>",
  "<p>But the challenge runs deeper. Doing things differently, or doing brand new things is HARD for organizations. You have to fight against existing roadmaps, existing biases, existing goals, existing routines and processes.</p>",
  "<p>And, crucially, it’s not about a well defined roadmap where we understand the variables. It’s impossible to forecast and roadmap a future for activities we don’t understand yet. How much will it cost to invest in this new channel? How fast can we see success doing this new thing? How many pieces of content can we create using the new process?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"management-is-prediction-and-its-hard-to-predict-new-things\">Management is prediction, and it’s hard to predict new things</h2>",
  "<p>Businesses are learning engines and management is prediction. Cedric Chin is writing a wonderful series right now on management as prediction and what that actually means in practice:</p>",

Most people think being data driven means looking at charts on a daily basis. Or they attempt to use data in their orgs, and then fall into one of the many traps that come with the territory.

  "<p>The key here is that for a business that wants to do new things - you need to, well DO THINGS before you really understand how they work or what the effects are. They’re new after all!</p>",
  "<p>So here we start to realize that maybe a prioritized roadmap isn’t the real goal - what we need is something that can guide us, but has plenty of room for learning, refinement and experimentation along the way.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"sequencing-is-like-prioritization-with-more-unknowns\">Sequencing is like prioritization with more unknowns</h2>",
  "<p>While not explicitly asked for, during these workshops I often end up creating a kind of sequencing view of their roadmap. If you think of strategy as the most abstract, and a roadmap as the most detailed - then a sequence is somewhere in the middle.</p>",

  "<p>Casey goes on to talk about not making a new strategy, but enforcing better sequencing of their existing strategy. We know what to do, but enforcing some sequencing can bring a sense of clarity to what we’re doing NOW and what we’re doing NEXT. Something weirdly missing from a lot of strategy (which often comes down to 5 things we should be doing right now).</p>",
  "<p>Here’s an example of a sequencing that came out of a consulting engagement with a business that sells online courses (with key details removed obviously):</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/strategy-roadmap.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>There’s a lot here - mostly because what this diagram shows us is what NOT to do. It allows us to choose a lane and focus.</p>",
  "<p>This isn’t really a prioritization (it doesn’t tell us what to do first) and isn’t really a roadmap (it doesn’t tell us when things will happen) but it still adds some clarity by ensuring the various opportunities in front of us are connected and dependent in various ways.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe the real value for a sequencing map like this is to help us understand how to get started with new things, and what we can expect to learn along the way. It’s making the unit of progress <em>learning</em>, not time.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"tradeoffs-and-revealed-values\">Tradeoffs and Revealed Values</h2>",
  "<p>Of course you’re still left with some choice - which things do we pursue first? How do we choose between the various paths we could follow? Once you really start to explore this idea you realize that there’s far more individual belief and values work going on than you might assume for “the world of business”.</p>",
  "<p>I love how Vaughn Tan breaks this down in the description of his Boris workshops:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Unpacking%20Boris\" data-author=\"Vaughn Tan\" cite=\"https://vaughntan.org/unpacking-boris\"><br /><p>Your tradeoff pattern shows more about your values than the goals you’re trying to achieve. A clothing company demonstrates different values if it is willing to use cheaper high-pesticide, water-intensive cotton than if it insists on only using low-input cotton in its products. What you choose to do and not do reveals what is and isn’t important. This is another way of saying that what a person or organization implicitly believes is valuable (or good, or moral, or worthwhile) determines the tradeoffs that are made.</p><br /><p>Different people and organizations have different tradeoff patterns because they have different values, different resources, or different constraints. Usually, all three forms of difference are at work.</p><br /><footer> <cite><a href=\"https://vaughntan.org/unpacking-boris\">https://vaughntan.org/unpacking-boris</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>Revealed values are really important - especially in small teams.</p>",
  "<p>It’s why I’ve started referring to product/market/founder fit instead of product/market fit. Again, the problem with most clients is not that they don’t know what to do - they know what to do, but they don’t really understand why they’re not doing it. This leads to personal frustration and burnout. So it’s key to try and design a strategy that isn’t an abstract ideal but actually aligns with the capabilities, values and beliefs of the team that is going to have to execute them…!</p>",
  "<p>In a two-day workshop, how much can you change beliefs and values? You can’t. But you CAN help with alignment between team members.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"gaining-clarity-on-the-principles\">Gaining clarity on the principles</h2>",
  "<p>Just like values, where there is surface level alignment but once you dig it unravels, there is also principles. Independent of the specific initiatives and measured goals, what are we trying to do?</p>",
  "<p>Most clients cheerfully say something like: we’re trying to grow!</p>",
  "<p>But when you start to unpack that, trouble starts - growth at all costs? No, of course not. Growth via raising capital? Oh lord no.</p>",
  "<p>It turns out there often isn’t a well articulated higher level objective. Nathan articulates that well in his piece on <a href=\"https://every.to/divinations/how-to-prioritize-a-roadmap\">problems with prioritization</a>:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"How%20to%20Prioritize%20a%20Roadmap\" data-author=\"Nathan Baschez\" cite=\"https://every.to/divinations/how-to-prioritize-a-roadmap\"><br /><h2>9. Define an organizing principle</h2><p>When anything goes, it’s impossible to choose between competing alternatives. There must be some strategic frame against which to measure ideas. But too often, the framing of this goal is taken for granted. Startups obsess over weekly growth rates, and public companies obsess over margins—but these are goals, not strategies. The best companies choose narrative frames in addition to measurable goals that help them stay focused.</p><p>For example, at Substack we cared about week-over-week growth like everyone else, but we also had organizing principles like “attract quality writers who are ready to go full-time on paid newsletters” that helped us organize our roadmap. For Lex, our current organizing principle is to build the best “first draft” writing experience in the world. If we only thought about the metrics we would be lost.</p><br /><footer> <cite><a href=\"https://every.to/divinations/how-to-prioritize-a-roadmap\">https://every.to/divinations/how-to-prioritize-a-roadmap</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>When I was more junior in my career I never really understood the idea behind creating a list of principles for a project or team. It all seemed too abstract and management-speak. Of course it IS management-speak. Principles are essentially a compression of a strategy so that they can survive contact with different teams and different team members.</p>",
  "<p>As Nathan mentions here - a narrative frame for a project can be a powerful guiding force as you navigate the unknown roadmap of doing new things.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"in-conclusion-giving-clients-new-ways-of-thinking\">In conclusion: Giving Clients New Ways of thinking</h2>",
  "<p>Ok, so this post is far too long and rambling but here’s the reveal - maybe (maybe!) the real value for these workshops is helping clients find new ways of looking at their business reality.</p>",
  "<p>If we accept the premise that strategy is a fluid, evolving thing - what is the most useful outcome from a moment-in-time intervention? For it to have enduring value I think it must allow us to think through situations we have not yet encountered. New tools for thinking through problems and situations.</p>",
  "<p>Ways for an executive team to upgrade their thinking. Of course, no one is going to buy that directly, but I think it’s the real job to be done for this kind of workshop.</p>",
  "<p>So, with that frame in mind the outcome for this kind of “total business review” workshop is some combination of these four dimensions:</p>",
  "<p><strong>1) New dashboards embed new ways of seeing the world.</strong> A dashboard<sup id=\"fnref:dashboard\"><a href=\"#fn:dashboard\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> is essentially an embedded mental model for how the business works - and if you can help the client create a new dashboard you can help them see the world in new ways. This is often a precursor to doing new things and doing things in new ways - because they suddenly have a measurement framework for it. You manage what you measure after all.</p>",
  "<p><strong>2) Sequencing is about what NOT to do, and what we need to learn.</strong> Roadmaps imbue a false sense of confidence in the future but the reality is that if we want to do new things, or do things in new ways we need to DO things so that we can learn. Learning how they work, learning whether we’re able to pull them off, learning how resources intensive they are. So a sequencing is a middle ground between abstract strategy and detailed roadmap.</p>",
  "<p><strong>3) New narrative frames</strong>. Operating within the context of the individuals, beliefs, cultures and biases of the team you’re working with it’s about seeking new principles, new clarity and new naming for ideas that seem important but hard to gain consensus on.</p>",
  "<p><strong>4) Capabilities &amp; process insights</strong>. There’s often a few key insights that come out of the two day session that help unlock next steps on key projects. Putting this through the lens of learning - these tend to function a bit like accelerated knowledge - you get to skip a few loops of do -&gt; learn -&gt; do by working with someone who knows the space, or has done it before.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe, after all that the real value add is clarity.</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">“ambiguity is the psychological malaise in which both mediocrity and evil thrive – an imperceptible sludge surrounding any endeavor defined by quality and vision",

  "<p>1) If you want the text to export as text, not as an image in the shape of text then you need to uncheck “outline text” when exporting the SVG from Figma.</p>",

  "<p>You know, auto-generating an SVG file from a database (ahem, a spreadsheet) wouldn’t be that hard… Maybe there’s a way to autogenerate some kind of map/web/diagram that spans a few sites at once?</p>",
  "<p>And, for the motivated reader - once you have everything as an SVG you can style it with CSS and make it interactive with JS to your heart’s content - so you if you want to show/hide or add interactions or movement to your SVG it’s as easy as adding a few lines of javascript…!</p>",

Here’s an example quote I used in my “notes on executive dashboards” riff:</p>",
  "<blockquote><br />  <p>But, there’s something deeper here. Over the last few years I basically only work with the C-suite of organizations. Supposedly the “people in charge”.

  "<p>It’s this kind of writing and example that situates your work in the mind of the reader.

  "<p>The trick (for me at least) is to recognize that content can be a gift. A good riff is like a little present. Slide into someone’s DMs and say “Hey I wrote this and thought of you…”.</p>",

  "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>",
  "<p>Imagine you care very much about Japanese woodblock prints, and you love the web. So you decide as an interested amateur to build a website to house your library of 200k+ prints. This of course is a thing that the internet has: <a href=\"https://ukiyo-e.org/\">ukiyo-e.org</a> - Japanese Woodblock Print Search, created by John Resig.</p>",
  "<p>Now, imagine that you’re not THE John Resig, world class web developer and founder of Jquery.</p>",
  "<p>We’ve built many tools for publishing to the web - but I want to make the claim that we have underdeveloped the tools and platforms for publishing collections, indexes and small databases.

  "<p>Here’s the thesis:</p><br /><ol><br />  <li>Independently published and maintained collections are interesting and valuable</li><br />  <li>Publishing them to the modern web is too hard and there are few purpose-built tools that help</li><br />  <li>Collaborating and maintaining them is a tough challenge</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>Sari (building a community index Startupy) has a nice piece exploring this tension:</p>",

  "<p>There ARE tools that allow you to manage collections and indexes, for specialist use cases. Ecommerce is the most obvious example. The core needs of creating a database of products, adding metadata, enabling search and creating collections are all well served by a range of tools (Shopify, Squarespace, etc etc).</p>",
  "<p>Meanwhile, there are many tools that allow independent authors to create content (Wordpress, Substack, Squarespace, Ghost, Webflow etc etc). But these tools place a heavy emphasis on documents and pages and less of an emphasis on collections of objects, links and metadata.</p>",
  "<p>To highlight this tension, consider a couple of examples:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The personal website of Rob Giampietro <a href=\"https://linedandunlined.com/\">lined and unlined</a> has a lovely index-view of content but defaults to a site: search in Google to handle search.</li><br />  <li>The <a href=\"https://cyberfeminismindex.com/\">Cyberfeminism Index</a> is an amazing collection of 828 resources, each with notes and quotes. Although the site has search the whole thing is a single HTML file with 100k+ lines of code.</li><br />  <li>Jarrett Fuller publishes a lovely collection of readings for people interested in design <a href=\"https://readings.design/\">readings.design</a> that has 251 resources but what appear to be manually created tags and no search.</li><br />  <li>My friend Jonah Dragan has been documenting amazing kids picture books, both popular and obscure. He has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jonahdragan/?hl=en\">over 900 archived on his Instagram</a>. How might this archive become, well, an archive?</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>To be clear, I’m not being critical of these resources! I very much enjoy them all and love that they exist. Indie web creators will use <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/\">digital bricolage</a> to use whatever tools they have to build things and that’s great. The Cyberfeminism Index even has an explicit focus on long-term maintainability and lack of dependencies which is great.</p>",
  "<p>But it shows some of the potential use cases where people are looking for “database publishing”.</p>",
  "<p>These are all individuals - personal things. But this challenge applies to institutions too. Here’s the digital art foundation Rhizome on building their archive of digital art projects Artbase:</p>",

  "<p>Let’s think through the kinds of use cases and functionality that is important. I’d say that the core features are:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li>Creating collections of objects</li><br />  <li>Adding and updating metadata for the objects (ideally in bulk if needed)</li><br />  <li>Creating collections, relationships and pathways through the data</li><br />  <li>Collaborating on these with others</li><br />  <li>Publishing to the web in an easy to consume way, with stable URLs, search etc</li><br />  <li>Open standard file formats for export / import / desktop editing</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>I think the last point is key to building an ecosystem of this stuff. We have CSV files as a kind of open standard for any kind of data - possible to open it in all kinds of applications (or even edit directly with a text editor) and yet we have no standard concept for a database file that you can just open and edit in a range of applications?</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"cybernetic-indexes\">Cybernetic Indexes</h2>",
  "<p>Let’s go beyond the simple use cases though - I’m excited about building extensions and automations for these small databases. The magic of the web is that automations (via chrome extensions, bookmarklets, zapier, cloud functions, github actions, replits etc) are becoming simple, easy to build and accessible to hobby-coders, not just professional developers.</p>",
  "<p>In an era of chat GPT, cheap search &amp; web-crawlers how can we make any small database come alive?</p>",
  "<p>Here’s an example of cybernetic database I want to build: I’d like to build an index of all the artists in Brooklyn<sup id=\"fnref:fiercely\"><a href=\"#fn:fiercely\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. This would be a resource for seeing a ton of local artists and their work all in one place. A database that’s searchable, taggable. This doesn’t exist today. How would you build it?</p>",
  "<p>And importantly - after you’ve built it, how would you bring it to life? I’m thinking things like:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Image machine learning to auto-extract tags and classifications around color, medium etc</li><br />  <li>Web-scrapers that can periodically re-crawl the artist’s websites and update the database with new works and new info</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>I could probably build this myself if I was really motivated but it would require building an <em>actual</em> database. There’s no readily available solution (that I know of) that would enable this kind of thing…</p>",

  "<p>I’d like to call out <a href=\"https://datasette.io/\">Datasette</a> in particular. Datasette is “An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data” created and maintained by Simon Willison.</p>",
  "<p>Of all the projects I’ve come across Datasette feels so closely ideologically aligned to what I want. It’s open source, Simon really cares about helping non-developers use it (via a cloud product, a <a href=\"https://datasette.io/desktop\">desktop product</a> etc) - it’s even building out <a href=\"https://github.com/cldellow/datasette-scraper/releases/tag/0.5\">web-scraping functionality</a>! Datasette is like a swiss army knife tool for exploring data but also allows you to publish that data to the web.</p>",
  "<p>Everything about Datasette feels great - the only problem is that it still feels slightly too far out of reach for your average enthusiast / indie publisher. There are still a lot of command line prompts around… This is not criticism of Simon - he’s an indie developer building the whole thing!</p>",
  "<p>Anyway - my point is that I think Datasette is going to get easier over time and may, if you’re more technical than me, be a good tool for this <em>today</em>.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"market-making-small-databases\">Market-making Small Databases</h2>",
  "<p>Actually - maybe this isn’t a real technology problem. Or at least not completely a technology problem. I think Substack is a good analogy here. Substack’s innovation comes in two flavors: firstly it is a lovely UX for creating, publishing and maintaining a paid email list. But secondly it’s also creating social validation and educating people that running a paid email list is a viable business.</p>",
  "<p>I think there might be a similar market-making innovation here for small databases.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a Substack for databases - an easy tool for creating, maintaining and publishing databases with the ability to restrict parts or all of it behind a pay wall. Pair it with the ability to send email updates to your audience about changes and additions. Maybe even roll in some of the data-cleanup and data-collection magic that machine learning and web scraping offers.</p>",
  "<p>Yes, you could assemble this exact business model today using a combination of Memberful and Airtable and Substack but…. it’s clunky. And there isn’t the market-awareness that running a business like this is viable, though there are some examples (e.g. <a href=\"https://2pml.com/\">2pmlinks</a> which is a paid email newsletter but has a set of small-databases attached to it called their Executive Library with collections of things like indie media businesses or an agency index).</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"conclusion-how-can-we-let-a-thousand-small-libraries-bloom\">Conclusion: How can we let a thousand small libraries bloom?</h2>",
  "<p>Depending on your mental model of the world, the shape of the data you want to work with, and your technical aptitude you might have strong reactions to this post. Things like “just use a real database!” or “no way!” or “This is missing the point” but I sincerely believe there is a whole set of publishing use cases waiting in the wings that are underserved today.</p>",

  "<p>This bookmarklet is like x-ray vision. You fire it up on the client’s website and it opens up a bunch of analysis showing things that this client cares about on the page.

  "<p><em>Being self-employed feels a bit like being on an extended road trip. Untethered and free, but lonely and unsupported too. Ultimate freedoms combined with shallow roots. Every year I write a recap, around the anniversary of quitting my last job (Oct 24th, 2014). Here’s my recap of year 8.</em></p>",
  "<p>First you shape your narratives and then your narratives shape you.</p>",
  "<p>Despite writing about the power of narratives and saying things like “the indie consulting journey is all about crafting an identity” in the last year I think I <strong><em>still</em></strong> underestimated the power of narrative.</p>",
  "<p>In 2021/2022 the SEO MBA ramped up, took on a life of it’s own and wrecked my personal narrative like a bull in a china shop. The next year is about picking up the pieces and reformulating my indie career.</p>",
  "<p>But let me back up. First, some highlights:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Roxy is now in first grade - she just started wearing glasses, is sassy and creative and fun.</li><br />  <li>Indy is in pre-school, running around like a maniac wielding his “ninja swords”<sup id=\"fnref:arms\"><a href=\"#fn:arms\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></li><br />  <li>Both kids got their COVID vaccines, what a historic era for science, and what a strange era for kids…</li><br />  <li>We moved house - still in Brooklyn but with more space for the kids to bounce off the walls! Overall probably the right move but this consumed a significant amount of energy and stress this year.</li><br />  <li>This recap is a bit late (my indie-versary is Oct 24th) because I was in Australia for a client’s executive off-site for 10 days. The first time I’ve seen a client in-person since the start of the pandemic.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<h2 id=\"consultant-or\">Consultant, or…..?</h2>",
  "<p>Almost exactly a year ago I launched the first <a href=\"https://seomba.com/\">SEO MBA</a> course. I knew it was broadly speaking a good idea and I knew there was demand for it but it’s still rewarding to look at this chart and see how quickly it dominated my revenue (consulting revenue in blue, course revenue in red):</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/8-years-revenue.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>But/and this came with some psychological cost. I launched the SEO MBA without much of a plan - I just knew there was demand for it and I knew that teaching was something I wanted to do more of.</p>",
  "<p>And now here we are with an almost 50/50 split between consulting and course revenue. Listen, I can’t complain! This is a huge success and I’m super grateful for everyone who’s supported and engaged with the SEO MBA. On the one hand you could view this 50/50 split as <em>healthy</em> - as a way to generate recurring revenue, diversifying revenue streams, becoming less reliant on client work etc etc.</p>",
  "<p>All these things are true.</p>",
  "<p>But on the other hand I feel this 50/50 split very keenly. I’ve clutched to the identity and narrative of “independent consultant” so strongly over the last 8 years that to suddenly find myself split between these identities has caused more internal anguish than I’d like to admit. Well, ok actually let me just admit it. It’s been hard. I’ve felt stuck. Paralyzed. Weirdly conflicted about simple things.</p>",
  "<p>I don’t have the solution yet. But before we think about that let’s stick with the recap a little further.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"consulting-work-recap\">Consulting Work Recap</h2>",
  "<p>I’m kind of a weirdo - I actually enjoy client work. There are a lot of indie consultants and freelancers that I think view client work as a means to an end, but don’t enjoy the rituals, cycles and pressures of the consultant/client dynamic. Not me. I love it! And perhaps the biggest surprise was that between moving house, vacation and growing the SEO MBA, as my client work declined my happiness also declined.</p>",
  "<p>Especially at the start of the year I actively declined client work in favor of sprinting to launch a second course - and looking back I can see that there was a knock-on effect. While teaching is very rewarding (more on that in the next section), it’s not nearly as <em>electric</em> as consulting. At least not the way I’ve been doing it (again, more on that later).</p>",
  "<p>In terms of the actual client work - I’ve done some of my best, and perhaps worst work this last year.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The good</strong>: kind of without noticing it the majority of my work is now P&amp;L-first. What I mean by that is that because I’m working at the executive layer inside organizations every project is a kind of finance-first project. Things like:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>What should our SEO strategy be? Let’s see what size of SEO team we can fit inside this P&amp;L.</li><br />  <li>Which direction should we grow in? Let’s take a look at which business units are high margin/low margin and model out some assumptions about TAM and growth rate.</li><br />  <li>How do we invest in growth, while maintaining positive EBITDA? Let’s sequence the growth initiatives and make sure we’re realizing growth as we go.</li><br />  <li>How do I get clarity on this business? Well, let’s ensure the executive team’s dashboard is closer to profit and margin and combines input and output metrics.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>I’m not sure if I’m getting more of this kind of work because I’m routinely interfacing with executive teams, or whether I’ve become better at this kind of work because of the time spent teaching these skills as part of the SEO MBA? Or, or! Maybe there’s a recession going on and everyone is now concerned about top line <em>and</em> bottom line….?</p>",
  "<p>Probably some combination of the above.</p>",
  "<p>It’s fun though to be able to stretch across a client organization to touch product, brand, marketing, operations and connect the overall strategy back to the reality of a P&amp;L.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The bad</strong>: It wasn’t all rainbows though. In early 2021 I did a content strategy project for a big tech company and I think it was some of my best work. I connected the dots smoothly between brand positioning and content strategy. I loved that project! So this year I tried to adapt the same approach for a much smaller client and… it didn’t work so well.</p>",
  "<p>I’ll probably write a proper post-mortem at some point but in essence I got the balance between strategy and stewardship wrong. The client pushed me to create a strategy, when they didn’t have the team in place to execute on it. The client told me that the strategy was still necessary since they were going to raise money soon. Foolishly I took them at their word - partly because I was excited to roll out my content strategy approach again - when in reality I should have pushed harder for the next most useful thing (which would likely have been a 2-3 slide version of the strategy for their VC investor deck to secure the funds combined with a focus on hiring their marketing team).</p>",
  "<p>I’ve been using this phrase “the next most useful thing” as a guiding light for my consulting work - I’m obsessed with being <em>useful</em> not just right. I’ve <em>always</em> rejected the fancy presentation in favor of the next most useful thing, and I simply took my eye off the ball with this one. I’m not even sure the client views this project as a real disappointment, there was still some value in it, but I’m mad at myself personally for this one. A good reminder not to take your eye off the ball. And to push your clients beyond what they tell you the right answer is.</p>",
  "<p>Anyway, while consulting work over the past year has been very patchy I just signed 3 new clients this week and I’m gonna be busy for a little bit. Feels good to get back into the consulting flow. Let’s crack open some P&amp;Ls.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"seo-mba-recap\">SEO MBA Recap</h2>",
  "<p>I’m going to write a separate full recap for the SEO MBA [<a href=\"https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/the-seo-mba-year-1-recap\">live now!</a>] because there’s a whole world there - but let’s look at some key pieces:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>The email list launched early 2021 and is now 8,000+ subscribers. Unfortunately I think that number is a little off since Substack has been juicing growth aggressively in the last 6 months and I’m not sure those users are high quality. Still, this number is bigger than I would have guessed!</li><br />  <li>The first course, <a href=\"https://seomba.com/executive-presence/\">Executive Presence</a> is truly the flagship course. It’s the most differentiated in the market and has sustained more demand than the second course <a href=\"https://seomba.com/client-management/\">The Art of Client Management</a>. I’m super proud of both courses and think both are deeply valuable, but people want to learn executive presence more than they want to learn client management. One is aspirational in nature, where one is more functional.</li><br />  <li>Learning how to shoot video, produce courses and design teaching programs has been interesting and rewarding.</li><br />  <li>I made a whole 3rd course that I scrapped before launch because I didn’t think it was good enough.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>When I designed the initial SEO MBA program I consciously avoided the live-teaching model of a cohort based course. I didn’t want to chain myself to that cadence and cycle of promotion/waitlist/course event. I think this was the right decision, but it also meant that a lot of my day to day with the SEO MBA is just me in front of a laptop. It’s “teaching” in the abstract but not in practical terms.</p>",
  "<p>So as I think about evolving and next steps I need to think about how to make the teaching a bit more active and electric. I’ll likely dabble with live cohorts as a complement to the self-paced courses.</p>",
  "<p>Meanwhile, the weekly office hours have continued and been a constant source of joy! The people that continue to show up here and invest time with the course really get a deep sense of growth from it. New perspectives, new jobs, new confidence, new clarity. These sessions end up being high value because everyone has a shared grounding from the course. I’m going to keep doing these.</p>",
  "<p>But the future roadmap for the SEO MBA is very unclear. Step on the gas with growth, ads etc? Fold in courses by other teachers? Continue to launch new courses? Double down and focus on the executive presence course? Transition to a membership model? Something else?</p>",
  "<p>We’ll see. I’m actively working my way through these questions right now. Shout if you have ideas.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"writing-recap\">Writing Recap</h2>",
  "<p>2022 was a great year for writing! In addition to the 20 SEO MBA newsletters I sent, I wrote 25 blog posts here on this site.</p>",
  "<p>I even briefly tried to sustain a weekly blogging habit! This flushed the cache for a few of my old drafts, felt energizing and generated two HN homepages. Wild what a little bit of consistent output can do! Then the summer came, buying a house and life etc and I fell off the wagon. I’d like to get back there though (maybe this is the first of my weekly blogging habit again? Let’s check in next year).</p>",
  "<p>My fave SEO MBA pieces I wrote this year:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><a href=\"https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/is-seo-worth-it\">Is SEO worth it?</a> - taking a little 20% beef with the SEO industry over how we talk about “SEO” investment (spoiler alert, most of the benefit of SEO doesn’t come from the SEO team).</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/nerding-out-on-nerdwallet\">Nerding out on Nerdwallet</a> - I loved writing this piece dissecting the Nerdwallet S-1 filing in detail. Helped me understand P&amp;Ls a bit more and helped me deepen my understanding of commerce content.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://newsletter.seomba.com/p/the-seo-skills-maturity-matrix\">The SEO skills maturity matrix</a> - hopefully a very concrete and tangible career map for SEO folks, and also a rallying cry for the “soft skills” that the SEO MBA teaches.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>My fave personal blog posts this year:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/01/06/jan-22-map-inquiry/\">Jan 2022 - Map of Inquiry</a> - trying to expose the questions that are alive and interesting for me right now. This helped create some through lines across various pieces of work and writing.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/01/26/electric-tables/\">Electric Tables V0.1</a> - some personal R&amp;D work! I absolutely <em>loved</em> creating Electric Tables. It was a great way to manifest a point of view through a prototype. Really proud of how this came out. I’d love to carve out more time for this kind of tinkering.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/04/06/teaching/\">Notes on teaching &amp; chairs</a> - pondering my relationship to teaching and exploring my personal mental model for creating learning environments (see also <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/07/14/bezier-butts/\">bezier butts</a>).</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/05/06/executive-dashboards/\">Some notes on executive dashboards</a> - you can see how this emerged out of my consulting work this year. I’m very happy with how this post came out and it generated a bunch of conversations behind the scenes<sup id=\"fnref:client\"><a href=\"#fn:client\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/05/12/google-ideas/\">Reflecting on things I failed to get done at Google</a> - personal therapy dealing with my time working at Google a decade ago. I wish I’d written this post a few years ago but I simply wasn’t ready yet.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/03/indie-consulting-map/\">A map for indie living</a> - maybe the best thing I’ve written about the indie consulting journey?! I bashed this out in an afternoon but people still reference this one. I think the “levels” I wrote about here really ring true for people and it comes with a set of practical ideas too. This map is going to make it into the book for sure!</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/06/16/rejecting-specialization/\">Rejecting specialization</a> - while this was the only actual writing I did this year for the book project I’m very happy with how it came out. This was a nice contrarian take and nails a few really important ideas about indie consulting (imho!)</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/07/05/agency/\">Some notes on agency at work</a> - as I’ve wrestled with a way to unify my work and my fragmented identity this idea of “increasing agency” has emerged as a very generative and important throughline. There’s more excavation to be done here but I really like this sense of purpose that sits across all different kinds of things I’ve been doing.</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Just re-reading that list and exploring the writing from the past year I feel energized to keep going. I love writing. And it’s a big win this year that I’ve been able to do so much of it.</p>",
  "<p>What’s that? Oh, <a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/\">the book</a>. Yes! Hmm. I’m still very much gung-ho on the book project but it is becoming ridiculous how much it’s dragging on at this point. Between the house buying, building the SEO MBA and the identity crisis the book has very much taken a backseat. But if I’m honest maybe the book is the right kind of project to crack open the future and find new opportunities, new identities?</p>",
  "<p>I’ve basically written the first draft of the book - what I need now is to find an editor who can be very hands on in helping turn the body of writing into a finished manuscript. Know anyone? Send them my way.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"networks-work\">Networks work</h2>",
  "<p>A huge, truly heartfelt thank you to everyone who’s supported and helped me this year. More than in previous years I’ve had to lean on my network for support, advice, company and feedback. Folks like Brian, Toby, Elan, Behzod, Howard, Sean, John, Jim &amp; the other Jim.</p>",
  "<p>As I write this, Twitter is on the precipice. I’m not going to pretend I know how this plays out but we’ve never seen a platform like Twitter for converting casual internet connections into deep friendships and for all it’s troubles I hope that whatever emerges from this current mess (Twitter or otherwise) can sustain the next decade of internet-friends.</p>",
  "<p>This past year has been a deep reminder of the power of networks. Much love to you all. ❤️❤️❤️</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"so-whats-next\">So, what’s next?</h2>",
  "<p>Oh haha you crazy fool. If you’ve read this far, I <strong><em>obviously</em></strong> have no idea. But, that’s the promise of indie living!</p>",
  "<p>Here’s about all I know:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>I’m not going to go “all-in” on the SEO MBA, at least not yet. Because consulting work is still generative and electric for me. I love it.</li><br />  <li>There is a bunch of relatively basic growth work to be done for the SEO MBA (email funnels, that kind of thing). Tune in next year to see if I can motivate myself to do them.</li><br />  <li>The SEO MBA “as is” has been a wonderful first step into teaching. Deeply rewarding (and lucrative!) but the next phase and evolution has to make teaching feel a bit more electric if it’s going to compete with my consulting work.</li><br />  <li>I’m going to pull myself out of this identity slump by sheer force of will. Watch me (tune in next year to see how that goes).</li><br />  <li>I’m excited to keep up the writing habit! Bloggy-blog-blog!</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>And finally, a big shout out to Paul Millerd. Fellow indie consultant, fellow course creator, fellow book author! Watching from afar I get the sense that Paul is just hitting his stride this year and it’s amazing to see. I love seeing other indie consultants thrive and come alive.</p>",

  "<p>An executive offsite typically tries to <strong>simplify the roadmap</strong> into a small set of top level goals. One problem with this is that it’s incredibly fragile - when reality changes (spoiler alert, it does!) it’s hard to maintain the hierarchy.</p>",
  "<p>Instead John has some thoughts about identifying “points of leverage”. These are single points of leverage that affect multiple top level objectives.

  "<p>There’s a lot of this that resonates with me - many executive strategy planning sessions come out with a nice-sounding strategy which just crumbles as soon as various teams start trying to shoe-horn their own agenda onto it. In fact teams can end up working <strong>against</strong> each other which is the exact opposite outcome you’re trying to get to with a strategy planning session!</p>",
  "<p>👻🎃💀</p>",
  "<p>I’m still working on a formalized process and methodology for running executive off-sites. I have an approach and format that works but I think it can be more opinionated. And obviously the best approach is tailored to the specific company and situation.</p>",
  "<p>But here’s some principles I think are worth aiming for:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li><strong>Pre-work is essential</strong>. There’s a lot of value in holding space for the executive team to come together and review the whole parts of the business. This requires each function preparing a useful deepdive and situation report of how that function works. This pre-work needs to be carefully managed, thought through and you need to enforce that the executive team spends time with the pre-work before the offsite.</li><br />  <li><strong>Don’t stop the deep-dives</strong>. Sometimes executives get confused (or are too afraid) to step on toes and so avoid getting into the weeds. It’s seen as a waste of time or somehow not practical to spend the exec team’s time discussion “lower level” things. But where there are critical initiatives (see John’s point about points of leverage) I think you should get into as much detail as you can.</li><br />  <li><strong>Be explicit about company clocks</strong>. Brian and I <a href=\"https://littlefutures.substack.com/p/little-futures-1-business-time\">wrote about company clocks</a> and I think one of the most useful outputs from an executive team is a sense of how urgent something is. Not everything is equal and agreeing not just on what needs to be done, but <strong>how fast it should be moving</strong> is useful.</li><br />  <li><strong>Make the trade-offs clear</strong>. Cribbing this one from Vaughn - being explicit about tradeoffs helps reveal areas where projects may be unrealistic, or where teams actually have competing values.</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>👻🎃💀</p>",
  "<p>Of course, all of this is trying to make the strategy planning session <strong><em>useful</em></strong>. But it assumes that the strategy is the most important outcome of the session. In reality, a lot of the value for an executive strategy session lies in the communication:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Ensuring that senior leaders <em>feel</em> like they are a part of the executive team and involved in decision making</li><br />  <li>Giving the executives a space to practice defending their decisions and talking about the roadmap</li><br />  <li>Finding shared language between functions so that after the offsite the various teams and functions across the organization feel like the company has a plan and has it’s @!#% together!</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>If the CEO company all-hands is a theatre performance. Then the executive offsite is the dress rehearsal.</p>",
  "<p>I use the language of theatre to suggest that <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>, <strong>language</strong> and <strong>feeling</strong> are important. But don’t be fooled - just because we live in the theatre of work doesn’t make it any less important or useful.</p>",

  "<p>A lot of innovation work revolves around shiny objects - maybe a slick interactive prototype, or a concept video. A lot of innovation projects never see the light of day.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe what’s needed are fewer shiny objects and more trails. Fewer artifacts and more paths. Less high concept innovation and more cabinet of curios.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>The first innovation project I worked on at Google Creative Lab was a 5-year vision for “The future of search”. We ended up creating the shiniest of shiny artifacts - a 15 minute live action video showing a day in the life of this future search world. We filmed some segments at the Museum of Natural History in New York. I almost broke a dinosaur bone carrying a lighting stand. We used the same special effects company as the Star Trek movie.</p>",
  "<p>The Google Creative Lab knows a thing or two about failed innovation. When I worked there in 2012 it seemed like the majority of their innovation projects failed. There was a lot of work that never became more than a slick video and a beautiful presentation. I can only think how many projects have been concepted and shelved in the decade since.</p>",
  "<p>I can’t speak to how the Creative Lab is now but back in 2012 it was very disconnected from the rest of Google. Sat in an ivory tower (almost literally!) this distance and separation was, I think, part of what enabled the team to work on weird and wonderful projects without oversight. But it was also the downfall of many of the projects that tried to bridge the gap and inform the main corporate strategy of Google proper.</p>",
  "<p>From new kinds of shopping ads to a vision for the future of search - things that tried to influence the core direction of Google products inevitably “failed”.</p>",
  "<p>But I put quotes around the word “failed” because innovation is a funny kind of work.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>As a consultant, I worked on an NYT R&amp;D project - I was part of a team that researched, scoped and designed some new travel verticals for the Times. We pitched the project in Feb 2020. Not a great time for a travel project in hindsight…</p>",
  "<p>Like I said, I know a bit about failed innovation.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>I think a lot of people who work in innovation get frustrated. Frustrated that their ideas don’t get absorbed by the main business. Frustrated that their prototypes don’t get funding. Frustrated that their ideas aren’t heard.</p>",
  "<p>The further you are from the core business the more freedom you have, but at the expense of influence. The closer you are to the core business the less freedom and creativity you have, but the more influence you have. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.</p>",
  "<p>Is innovation work just a game of percentages? Take a bunch of swings and eventually some of the ideas might stick? Is your “hit rate” even the right metric for an innovation lab?</p>",
  "<p>The funny thing is that a lot of innovation projects “fail” - they don’t get funding or don’t get built - but some part of the innovation work eventually bleeds out into the world. Sometimes it’s as small as a logo, or a name. Sometimes it’s a unique interaction pattern. Or sometimes the innovation is swallowed whole, consumed and only years later emerges on the product roadmap. Imperceptible, the impact of the innovation work only visible to the team that worked on it.</p>",
  "<p>A lot of innovation work only fails if you measure it the wrong way.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>Managing innovation work is about controlling narrative as much as it’s about controlling cost/timing/project management.</p>",
  "<p>We had a custom-built project management solution at the Creative Lab (I think it was called OTIS?). It basically stripped away any of the kinds of features that you might expect in a project management tool and reduced every project to a weekly 100-character status update, paired with a link to the latest creative work (presentation, design, video, etc). Every Monday morning the Creative Lab leadership team would huddle around and review the status updates for each project.</p>",
  "<p>At the time I don’t think I understood how powerful narrative is inside large organizations. I thought building a business case, modeling out impact and so on were how you got buy-in and budget.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>One of the most interesting innovation projects I was part of was with my friends at <a href=\"https://www.partandsum.com/\">Part+Sum</a>. I was part of a week-long innovation workshop with P+S employees, external advisors, client team members and customers. Essentially, this brings the client <em>into</em> the innovation work for a week<sup id=\"fnref:partandsum\"><a href=\"#fn:partandsum\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>.</p>",
  "<p>Inviting the client into the innovation work itself (vs just showing the shiny object at the end of the sprint) I believe makes the work better but also means the client is more invested in the end result.</p>",
  "<p>Innovation work that fits the client’s business model and constraints. And that the client is invested in bringing to life. Embracing from the beginning the idea that the innovation work is far less likely to be shipped “as is” and more likely to be subsumed and assimilated by the larger organization, the impact bleeding out over time.</p>",
  "<p>And here, in this innovation sprint model, the impact is as much the prototypes created as it is the experience of the employees directly of the innovation process.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>I’ve been reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Informational-City-Economic-Restructuring-Development/dp/0631179372\">The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process</a> in which Manuel explores the idea of a “space of flows”:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Space%20of%20flows%20-%20Wikipedia\" data-author=\"\" cite=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flows\"><br />The <b>space of flows</b> is a high-level cultural abstraction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\" title=\"Space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">space</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\" title=\"Time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time</a>, and their dynamic interactions with digital age society. The concept was created by the sociologist and cybernetic culture theoretician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Castells\" title=\"Manuel Castells\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manuel Castells</a> to \"reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm\"<br /><footer> <cite><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flows\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_of_flows</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",
  "<p>I like this framing. And I think it fits innovation work well. What if we placed less emphasis on the shiny object and more on the “space of flows”?</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>Professional work is all about streams and flows - we’re almost a decade into the stream-ification of work. Slack heralded an era of realtime notifications, channels (as virtual spaces to work in) and flows of work.</p>",
  "<p>And shiny objects aren’t really designed for flows. Once they’re gone, they’re gone.</p>",
  "<p>So a lot of companies are trying to figure out how to adapt their work to flows and streams. How to remember things for longer periods of time. How to capture learnings that compound instead of getting washed away.</p>",
  "<p>How do you adapt innovation work in a post-document / post-shiny-object culture?</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>Talking about the “space of flows”… two new approaches to feeds that caught my eye:</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.campsite.design/\">Campsite.design</a> from Brian Lovin - “The home for your design team’s work-in-progress”. Essentially a feed for your design team. Interesting.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.constellate.team/\">Constellate</a> from Brie Wolfson - “Treating organizations like the (mostly) online communities they now are”. This is early days but I love how Brie articulates the challenges and opportunities for knowledge production and knowledge consumption inside organizations:</p>",
  "<p>I think we’re entering the stream 2.0 era of professional work. Video feeds. Algorithmic feeds. Social feeds. Stock and flow. The next era will feel different from the last - and it’s not just a feeling, the format, approach and narrative for work will change. And it’ll happen fastest for the types of work that are already narrative based. Like innovation.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>Here’s a thesis I’m toying with:</p>",
  "<p><strong>Innovation work should start with narrative</strong>. Create a perspective on the world and from there develop a set of research / data / prototypes / experiments that all ladder back to your narrative.</p>",
  "<p>This narrative-first approach to innovation feels designed for a professional world that is increasingly a “space of flows”.</p>",
  "<p>Of course, it’s harder. Because most innovation teams don’t have a perspective on the world. They don’t have a thesis or core insight about how the world is changing or where things are headed. Instead they get obsessed with new shiny things.</p>",
  "<p>💡</p>",
  "<p>Anyway, I’ve always been interested in innovation work that straddles the venn diagram of business impact, creativity and narrative.

  "<h2 id=\"blogging-as-economic-opportunity\">Blogging as economic opportunity</h2>",
  "<p>The Web 2.0 era created a lot of rich bloggers. But it also cemented this view that making money from blogging is <strong>hard work</strong> (spoiler alert: making money in any way tends to be hard work). But our view of “making money from blogging” is too narrow. When I look across the people I know who are bloggers - I think they tend to have greater economic opportunities than those that don’t.</p>",
  "<p>I only know a handful of people directly making money from blogging (via ads, subscriptions etc) but I know many more who:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li>Got a better career because of blogging (new job, better pay etc)</li><br />  <li>Negotiated better contracts (e.g. with a publisher or platform) because they had “an audience”</li><br />  <li>Sold their own courses / ebooks / books / merchandise / music</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>Blogging is this kind of engine that opens up economic opportunity and advantage. Being visible in the networked economy has real value.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"blogging-as-social-opportunity\">Blogging as social opportunity</h2>",
  "<p>But blogging is more than economic opportunity - it’s an engine for social connection too. As Henrik says:</p>",

  "<p>It’s common to think of blogging as <em>“building an audience”</em>, but this can sound negative, self-serving, sleazy and promotional. Instead we can think of blogging as <em>“finding your people”</em>, which sounds much more wholesome, generative and positive.</p>",
  "<p>The truth is that maybe it’s a bit of both - but that increasing your social surface area can have real positive effects. From finding peers to building friendships to, yes, influence and audience.</p>",
  "<p>So if blogging is a real force for economic and social opportunity, why don’t more people do it?</p>",

  "<p>Craig is a great example of someone who has leveraged online writing into economic and social opportunity. From funding and distributing his books, to paid writing gigs to building a <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/membership/\">special projects</a> revenue stream to enable long walks.</p>",
  "<p>Stripe is interested in the GDP of the internet and Stripe understands that writing is an economic engine. Maybe it’s not so crazy to ask what the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow/status/1512458520188313610\">GDP of blogging is</a>?</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps un-ironically you could invest in growing the small business economy by investing in blogging.</p>",
  "<h2 id=\"teaching-agency-via-blogging\">Teaching Agency via Blogging</h2>",
  "<p>Let’s return to Nadia’s quote from the top - I think this is part of why I’m weirdly passionate and excited about blogging.

  "<p>There’s something here - it’s partly why, despite the narrative that “blogging is dead” we see things like <a href=\"https://writeofpassage.school/\">Write of Passage</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ship30for30.com/\">Ship 30 for 30</a> being incredibly popular.</p>",

  "<p>We used to use the term <em>blogosphere</em> - an organic sounding term. But what if we took the idea of ecosystem seriously. How might we enable our digital gardens to commingle and run wild? How can we build shared community gardens, with co-authors and shared ownership?</p>",

  "<p>I’ve been trying to make sense of my work recently. Launching the SEO MBA kind of bifurcated my possible futures into “consulting” and “course creating” - different types of work with different kinds of audiences. My consulting work is with senior executives and founders while the SEO MBA is aimed at SEO professionals.</p>",
  "<p>How to reconcile these possible futures and possible selves?</p>",
  "<p>Through a bunch of conversations with close friends - maybe the common throughline is increasing agency.</p>",
  "<p>Specifically - the idea of increasing agency for people’s work selves. This feels promising as a potential north star because it neatly aligns with the big things I’m spending my time on:</p>",
  "<ol><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/consulting/\">Consulting work</a>: My consulting work these days is mostly about two things - it’s about bringing strategic clarity to executives and helping organizations build new capabilities. My best client work involves very long engagements where I get to know my point of contact very well. This work blurs the boundaries between consulting and coaching. And it’s all about increasing agency - increasing the clarity and sense of forward momentum.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://seomba.com/\">SEO MBA teaching</a>: The courses I’ve built (especially the course on Executive Presence) help people increase their personal agency. It’s not really about teaching skills as much as it’s providing new vantage points and new ways of conducting yourself so that you can take on more senior work. There are plenty of stories of people taking the course and then getting a new job. This is more than just “upskilling” - it’s about increasing agency.</li><br />  <li><a href=\"https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/\">Indie consulting book</a>: The core thesis for the book is how to build a sustainable independent consulting practice. And much of the writing is about how to maintain autonomy and agency despite pressures to standardize your work and narrow your focus. This is very much in line with an idea of “increasing agency for indie consultants”.</li><br /></ol>",
  "<p>So in effect you could argue that I’ve been focused on increasing agency for: executives, SEO professionals and indie consultants.</p>",
  "<p>Feels right. I certainly get a kick out of this kind of work.</p>",

  "<p>One of the first distinctions to tease apart is the difference between fulfilling work and high-agency work. From David MacIver with some great notes on fulfilling work:</p>",

  "<p>David goes on to suggest that work almost never meets these criteria, and that’s partly why chasing “fulfilling work” might be the wrong objective. Work with purpose and meaning sounds nice but might be impossible to reach? It’s not quite what I’m getting at with increasing agency.</p>",
  "<p>High-agency work is <em>almost</em> independent of work with purpose and meaning. Except my hunch is that these two concepts are actually deeply intertwined…</p>",
  "<p>More to unearth and think about.</p>",
  "<p>🕹️</p>",
  "<p>I sketched out this 2x2 for the kinds of “joy of work” that we might talk about. Just a sketch:</p>",
  "<p><img src=\"/images/work-2x2.svg\" alt=\"\" /></p>",
  "<p>Where:</p>",
  "<ul><br />  <li><strong>High Skills / Inner World</strong>: This is the kind of raw skills of personal productivity. Within your own personal sphere can you optimize your ways of working? This might involve organizing your work, inbox zero, clearing up your calendar, etc. I think this kind of work is appealing when you’re early in your career because it doesn’t require anyone else giving you permission and can be done in almost any context. Level up your own personal systems as a way to control your work.</li><br />  <li><strong>High Skills / Outer World</strong>: This is your ability to create systems of influence. To be able to improve the systems and processes around you. This is appealing as you get more senior and develop more “executive presence”. This kind of work scales all the way up to formal management roles where imposing clarity, systems, process and order onto teams and systems is appealing. Essentially, can you control the world around you?</li><br />  <li><strong>High Meaning / Inner World</strong>: This is the idea of doing day to day work that is stimulating. Are the tasks in front of you energizing? If you like spending time in spreadsheets are you spending time in spreadsheets? If you like designing, are you spending time in Figma? This is where the concept of flow comes in - are you spending chunks of your day in enjoyable focused work.</li><br />  <li><strong>High Meaning / Outer World</strong>: This is the big idea of “work with purpose” - fulfilling work that has meaning in the world around you. This has high ideals of purpose and doing good - but could also be measured as impact. Is the work you’re doing creating a tangible impact in the world?</li><br /></ul>",
  "<p>🕹️</p>",
  "<p>When you put together a course, you’re supposed to focus on the personal transformation, not the skills. Complete the phrase “After taking this course you will <strong>__</strong>_”.</p>",
  "<p>The more aspirational you can make this the better your course will sell I think. People like to aspire to be someone new.</p>",
  "<p>But this brings up a subtle point: what are the boundaries of who you believe you can become? How much personal transformation is possible? This is a very individual and personal question but an important one. As I begin to explore the research literature around this concept of agency I see there’s a term “bounded agency” which investigates personal agency as a complex interwoven set of dependencies:</p>",
  "<blockquote class=\"quoteback\" darkmode=\"\" data-title=\"Bounded Agency in Professional Lives\" data-author=\"Karen Evans\" cite=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-60943-0_2\"><br />Bounded agency is a feature of actors’ engagements in the complex social ecologies of work, learning and social responsibility. The spaces in which human agency is exercised are regulated by professional bodies, through the setting of professional standards and by public policy, through the&nbsp; regulation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; employment&nbsp; relationship&nbsp; and&nbsp; through&nbsp; wider&nbsp; systems&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; management of employment and government interventions directly targeted at the workplace.",

  "The development that takes place through the exercise of human agency is not that  of  the  self-propelled  autonomous  individual  but,  rather,  relational  and  profoundly social in nature.

A percentage of these are long-standing professionals (across a range of practices) who are coming to the end of their full-time or paid working lives. The negotiation of the final period of your working life inside a museum is, I think, worthy of as much attention and support as that emerging / entry period. And yet it is something that is rarely discussed out loud. How to accommodate, enjoy the benefit of, and celebrate people who are late in their careers, who are going through family changes, health changes, financial changes, and for some a massive change in their identity, as they contemplate leaving a career (and sometimes a single institution) to which they have dedicated decades' of mental, physical and emotional energy. Not to mention the subtle (or unsubtle) pressure of the generations behind these people, who - frankly - want the jobs they currently hold. While there's a lot of emphasis on internships, promotion and career development, there aren't similarly strong shared frameworks in place for how to reduce working hours, responsibilities, or shift the emphasis from producing outputs to transferring knowledge.<br /><footer> <cite><a href=\"http://best-of-3.blogspot.com/2022/06/emerging-submerging-sinking-or-swimming.html\">http://best-of-3.blogspot.com/2022/06/emerging-submerging-sinking-or-swimming.html</a></cite></footer><br /></blockquote><br /><script note=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Blogger-Peer-Review/quotebacks@1/quoteback.js\"></script>",

  "<ul><br />  <li>What language do I use to describe this? Is it increasing agency or increasing joy? The joy of work? Is clarity a component of agency?</li><br />  <li>What is the existing literature and research into agency? Is this a field that people are studying?</li><br />  <li>On a spectrum from “working 1:1 with a CEO” to “teaching groups” to “self-paced courses” which formats are most transformative? And which formats do I find most energizing?</li><br />  <li>To what degree is increasing agency a function of skills, experience, perspective and opportunity?</li><br />  <li>Am I most interested in increasing agency for early/mid/late career folks?</li><br /></ul>",
