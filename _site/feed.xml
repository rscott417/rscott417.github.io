        <title>Taking Blogging Seriously</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s a warm summer night in NYC and I’m walking through central park with a friend, the fireflies blink around us like an external reflection of the neurons firing in our brains as the conversation sparks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google is Grounded and Needs to Learn How to Soar</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s the punchline - I think Google is missing the mark with their AI search efforts. In this post I have a concrete proposal and a prototype you can try yourself that shows a different approach for the future of search. An approach that’s better for users &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; in a way that’s beneficial to the open web at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3,573 Days On The Road</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;ba b--black-10 bg-newgreen-light br2 pa3 f5 i&quot;&gt;
Every year on the 24th October I&apos;ve written a reflection on the last year of my independent consulting. This would have been my 10th issue, but is instead a special issue, for reasons that will become apparent.&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Working With Founders Who Have Conviction and Taste</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Consulting can be easy money. Fleecing clients for cheap tricks. Clients have problems, you have powerpoints. It’s easy to flip a few quick slides into a chunk of cash and cackle off into the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Work is a Place</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;My buddy Luke recently started a band called Tattoo Mustache. While we were chatting, his eyes lit up talking about jamming in the studio with his bandmates - his arms were flailing and you could feel the energy coming off him like steam from a hot pan. These weekly jam sessions are something magical - &lt;em&gt;“You can just rent a studio for 3 hours”&lt;/em&gt; he said &lt;em&gt;“it’s like $116 and they have a drum kit and keyboard and everything!”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How do You Cultivate Customer-Centric Executives?</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;div class=&quot;ba b--black-10 bg-newgreen-light br2 pa3 f5&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;ttu black-50 pb2 b tracked&quot;&gt;summary&lt;/div&gt;
After consulting with ~40 companies across a wide range of industries and sizes, I ask the question: what have I observed about the most successful companies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is that the most successful companies have a key executive who is customer-centric - someone who has a rich mental model for what customers want and is able to step into the customer&apos;s shoes.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I theorize that beyond a culture of being customer-centric it&apos;s the ability to make key decisions with a customer-centric mindset that is important. But how do you cultivate this perspective for executives?&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>(Another) Quick Riff on Narrative Strategy</title>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been ruminating on the idea of &lt;strong&gt;narrative strategy&lt;/strong&gt; for a while now. The last time I wrote about it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/02/20/narrative-strategy/&quot;&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
