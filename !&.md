title: The !& community
subtitle: A space for independent consultants
---

The !& community (*pronounced: Yes! And...*) is two things:

- A space for independent consultants to learn and grow
- Regular salon discussions to explore the world of indie consulting

My core ambitions with the space:

- Create a weird space. Embrace the uniqueness of independent workers.
- Create a generative space to create new opportunities and new ways of thinking.

I've removed the open invite link to prevent the space growing too quickly. But if you identify as an independent consultant and want an invite DM me or email me.
