What kinds of problems would be interesting to build?

- Open feed readers (e.g. /feeds)
- Cross-domain blogchains (is oembed the answer here?)
- Better web-mentions
- Aggregators (e.g. newmodels - how do we build these?)

Maybe the answer is... different. Like a Kickstarter campaign to re-brand RSS.

What would it look like to re-build Twitter powered by blogs? That's micro.blog right?

So - something, different? Conversation is the heart of it. Not writing.
