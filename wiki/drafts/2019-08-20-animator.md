In 2019 I have done a few product design projects. Partnering with talented designers to bring concepts and ideas to life.

Reflecting on things learned.

I know enough design to be dangerous and being able to leave notes in 

Exploration is more important than polish.

You can't divorce thinking and design.

## So What's Next?

Where to from here with the next ones? I'm excited to bring together a full media design perspective on projects - thinking of projects not just as products but as systems - designing the CMS hand in hand with the front end, designing the analytics hand in hand with the content. This stuff matters when you think about it as a system to realize the affordances, quirks and nuance.
