## Passing the Torch

There are too many great indie consultants to name them all but some of the best of the best that I've worked with or gotten close with over the years that I'd heartily recommend:

* Elan Miller with his studio [Off Menu](https://www.off-menu.com/). Elan is the best person in the world at weaving brand strategy, product strategy and business strategy together into a cohesive whole.
* 

If you need intros to any of the above reach out.
