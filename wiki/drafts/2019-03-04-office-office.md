We have moved from open-plan physical designs to open-plan digital designs. Always-on always-noisy.

Peripheral work.

Slack buries any notion of thinking.



The office and the office - overlapping contexts for work.

The theatre of work.

Performative noise.

I'm working in an office right now that is largely and oral culture - little slack, few documents. And it's not necessarily better.
