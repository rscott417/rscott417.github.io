books:
 - title: Simulation and its discontents
   author: Sherry Turkle
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16921592W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8126259-L.jpg
   date_finished: 07/07/2025
   notes: An excellent short adventure through the ways computers simulate the world around us and how that changes our perception of the world and computers. Especially relevant for today's world of AI.
 - title: The Lathe of Heaven
   author: Ursula K. Le Guin
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL59858W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/26458-L.jpg
   date_finished: 06/07/2025
   notes: Excellent! Dreams as simulations. The perils of agency. A vivid description of a wonderful unique premise. This could easily have gone off the rails but Ursula is a master and this was amazing. The ending at first gave me pause but I think I've come to terms with it and embrace the taoist reading.. Beautiful writing.
 - title: The maniac
   author: Benjamín Labatut
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL34388805W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14036185-L.jpg
   date_finished: 06/07/2025
   notes: Super engrossing. I had just watched the AlphaGo documentary and AI is of course 100% of the discourse and so this felt very timely but also timeless. I slightly preferred When We Cease to Understand the World but this was a close second. Excellent.
 - title: How the light gets in
   author: Pat Schneider
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19963635W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12180367-L.jpg
   date_finished: 03/07/2025
   notes: Wow. Thank you Brian for this amazing book. Poetry, writing, spirituality, self publishing and so much more. This was part autobiography, part writing manual and part manifesto for creativity and believing in yourself. Magical. Highly recommended.
 - title: When We Cease to Understand the World
   author: Benjamín Labatut
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL28769111W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/11416803-L.jpg
   date_finished: 01/07/2025
   notes: One of my all time faves. What an astonishing book. Mathematics, insanity, creativity. Highly recommended.
 - title: Moonbound
   author: Robin Sloan
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL37620546W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14633560-L.jpg
   date_finished: 12/07/2025
   notes: A fresh new approach! I admire Robin's attempt at something decidedly new and fresh and form-breaking. The writing certainly kept me reading and I overall enjoyed it but it felt a little kitchen-sink-esque with maybe too many new ideas all at once? Also I think there's some core Arthurian analogy that I didn't quite make sense of... But overall an enjoyable read.
 - title: Guest Lecture
   author: Martin Riker
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL28405940W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13346428-L.jpg
   date_finished: 11/15/2024
   notes: A weird little novel that I mostly enjoyed. I think the core message was supposed to land more aspirationally but the anxiety of the main character felt like it got in the way a bit too much?
 - title: Boys
   author: Katie Hafner
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL25586990W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/13346783-L.jpg
   date_finished: 11/07/2024
   notes: Read this on Eliot Peper's recommendation and loved it! A unique kind of setup and really nicely written. Kept me reading and engrossed. Recommended.
 - title: The Space Between Worlds
   author: Micaiah Johnson
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20884745W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10211392-L.jpg
   date_finished: 09/07/2024
   notes: Passable sci-fi with an interesting premise. The world was well crafted and the core mechanic was novel but the characters always felt a bit flat and the romance pretty far contrived!
 - title: The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue
   author: V. E. Schwab
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20796936W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/10092261-L.jpg

   author: Rosemary Kirstein

   date_finished: 10/10/2023
   notes: While I loved the series overall the third book really felt flat and didn't work for me. It's hard to put my finger on why but something really missed here...
 - title: The Obelisk Gate
   author: N. K. Jemisin

   author: Adam Brookes

   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL27160171M-L.jpg
   date_finished: 04/17/2023
   notes: Loved this! I don't read spy novels very often but Robin Sloan recommended it and I loved the story and the fast paced action. Fun change of pace - and there's some great writing in there. Recommended. 
 - title: Mountain in the Sea
   author: Ray Nayler
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL27172785W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL38001523M-L.jpg
   date_finished: 04/05/2023
   notes: Fun to read this against the backdrop of GPT3/GPT4! I enjoyed the book but found it kind of fizzled out at the end. I was hoping it was going to work towards some kind of crescendo but found the ending just kind of weak. But I still enjoyed the read.
 - title: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow
   author: Gabrielle Zevin
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL26004554W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12859975-L.jpg
   date_finished: 03/21/2023
   notes: What a fun read! Poignant, fun and really engrossing. It reminded me of hints of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon at times though I don't think it had quite the same depth. Recommended though!
 - title: Captains of the sands
   author: Jorge Amado
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19709950W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL26923104M-L.jpg

   notes: Love the style and sense of wonder that Jorge writes with. Perhaps I should read the other Bahia books in the series... 
 - title: Suitcase Clone
   author: Robin Sloan

   notes: A lovely novella from Robin Sloan that builds on the Robin Sloan Cinematic Universe...! Fast pasted and full of intrigue. Definitely left me wanting more!
 - title: Popisho
   author: Leone Ross
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL20849886W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL28229066M-L.jpg
   date_finished: 09/21/2022
   notes: What a magical lush book. Ugly, raw, squelchy. The opposite of the Ruth Ozeki book I just read... Popisho is full of exquisite descriptions, magical realism, surreal nonsense and raw, bloody, colorful magic. Full of gods and humans at their best and worst I absolutely loved this book. If you're looking for something that is a riot of color, emotion and humanity then this is it.
 - title: The Book of Form and Emptiness
   author: Ruth Ozeki
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL24197713W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL35354576M-L.jpg
   date_finished: 08/28/2022
   notes: While at times Ruth Ozeki's writing is lyrical and magical, mostly this book felt kind of sterile. Neither of the main characters feel deeply explored and the most interesting characters (the aleph and the bottleman) are really only side events. Overall the book tasted like it had been aged in steel barrels and I was left wanting something more full bodied, more lyrical, more vivid.
 - title: Assassin's Fate
   author: Robin Hobb
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL19098683W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8417258-L.jpg
   date_finished: 06/11/2022
   notes: Oof. That concludes reading all 16 of the realm of the elderlings books. I haven't kept detailed notes on them but I'm so glad that I read them all and read them in order. In many ways Nighteyes is the main character. These last three books tie together so many threads and loose ends - the storyline is dark but the ending is magical. Robin Hobb has such a powerful command of both small characters and giant worlds.

   date_finished: 02/10/2021
   notes: What richness! The first time I've read sci-fi that felt a bit like Iain M Banks. Deep, complex, rich worlds with strong characters. An absolute treat - spanning langauge, poetry, politics, identity, memory and more. I cannot wait for the followup. After reading so much poorly written sci fi recently (Dune, The Ministry of the Future, Exhalation..) this was a refreshing breath of fresh air.

   notes: Abandoned during the free preview. Everyone is raving about this book but honestly the writing felt incredibly flat. I'm tired of sci-fi stories having bad writing :(
 - title: Exhalation

   date_finished: 01/04/2021
   notes: Abandoned 2/3 of the way through :( - while I quite enjoyed some of the provocations in the stories ultimately the writing didn't captivate me. Left me feeling bored so I gave it up.
 - title: Multidimensional Executive Coaching

   date_finished: 01/06/2021
   notes: Some great thought provoking ideas about coaching, consulting and being embedded inside organizations as an outsider. I especially love the concept in the book of overbounded or underbounded organizations.
 - title: The Player of Games
   author: Iain M. Banks
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Player-Games-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/0316005401
   date_finished: 12/01/2020
   notes: I have fond memories of the first time reading this and felt like it left a big impression on me. Re-reading this book I still loved it but the shine has come off a little - I think other culture books are perhaps better. Still, the world building (universe building!) that Iain M Banks does is like no other.
 - title: Dune
   author: Frank Herbert
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert/dp/0441172717
   date_finished: 11/30/2020
   notes: Started reading this while traveling through Utah and Arizona to get a feel for desert living. I enjoyed the book but definitely didn't feel like it lived up to the hype. Inventive but the characters felt a little stale.
 - title: "Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software"

   link: https://www.amazon.com/Working-Public-Making-Maintenance-Software/dp/0578675862
   date_finished: 10/15/2020

   date_finished: 08/22/20
   notes: Classic sci-fi short stories recommended by Matt Webb. Some really lovely ideas and great writing! All the stories are very character-driven and often reflect more strongly on the individual characters motives and identities over the larger sci-fi conceits! Lovely. Thanks Matt!
 - title: East of Eden
   author: John Steinbeck
   link: https://www.amazon.com/East-Eden-Penguin-Orange-Collection/dp/0143129481
   date_finished: 07/29/20
   notes: What a magnificent - truly epic work. I'm a big Steinbeck fan already and I think I even read this one previously but loved immersing myself in this wonderful story. The biblical theme is almost too strong at times but is richly counterbalanced by Steinbeck's incredibly loving character portraits. Amazing.
 - title: Veil

   link: https://www.amazon.com/Veil-Eliot-Peper-ebook/dp/B085PSTJNC   
   date_finished: 06/08/20
   notes: A really great fast-paced read. Eliot has a great knack for constructing plausible near-futures and then situating fully realized human stories within those futures. Thought provoking and enjoyable.
 - title: The Memory Police
   author: Yoko Ogawa
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Police-Novel-Yoko-Ogawa/dp/1101870605
   date_finished: 05/17/20
   notes: While the writing style at times is captivating - like a penny falling into a deep well - often the writing was unremarkable and the plot unfolded fairly slowly. All in the book was, ironically, forgettable. That said - the ending, where bodies start to fade away really resonated during this period of lockdown and isolation - it captures the essence of my embodied self fading away into an infinite series of zoom screens.
 - title: Working Identity- Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career

   link: https://www.amazon.com/Working-Identity-Unconventional-Strategies-Reinventing/dp/1591394139
   date_finished: 05/15/20
   notes: A wonderful meditation on career change (and life change generally) as being a process of iterating and trying on new identities. Has deep implications for independents also. Going to blog this book up. Originally found via Vaughn Tan's newsletter.
 - title: An Introduction to Haiku
   author: Harold Gould Henderson
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Haiku-Anthology-Poems-Poets/dp/0385093764
   date_finished: 03/12/20
   notes: Brian suggested I get into Haiku and pick up this book and I'm glad I did! Beautiful, easy to read intro to Haiku. The author gives great context for what Haiku is, the main poets and how to read Haiku poetry. Recommended!

   link: https://www.amazon.com/Winters-Promise-Mirror-Visitor-Quartet-ebook/dp/B07B8WK17G
   date_finished: 12/30/19
   notes: There are moments when the lavish fantasy world and the magic contained in it sucked me in - but ultimately the character development and plot just didn't hang together to keep me reading. Good escapist reading but there are better fantasy worlds to lose yourself in than this one.
 - title: Less

   link: https://www.amazon.com/Less-Winner-Pulitzer-Prize-Novel/dp/0316316121
   date_finished: 12/20/19

 - title: Infinite Detail
   author: Tim Maughan
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Detail-Novel-Tim-Maughan/dp/0374175411
   date_finished: 12/1/19
   notes: A fun quick read. There's some good language and some nice world-setting but I wish some of the characters had been more fully developed and I wish the central idea had been stronger. The ending kind of fizzles out and there could have been room for so much more here.. Good for a little lightweight-dytopia though.
 - title: Dead Astronauts
   author: Jeff VanderMeer
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Astronauts-Novel-Jeff-VanderMeer/dp/0374276803
   date_finished: 11/15/19
   notes: I think perhaps I made a mistake. I didn't realize until after I'd read it that it was part of the Borne series. Maybe that would have been useful because this book made zero sense. Like a William Burroughs book it was somehow interesting and riveting at times despite literally making no sense. Did I mention it makes no sense? The first section with the three astronauts was the most compelling..... Maybe I should read the other Borne books and it'll make more sense? But I doubt it.
 - title: The Nix

   date_finished: 10/28/19
   notes: Abandoned 500 pages in. I tried to keep going but just couldn't. A Very Bad Book. Highly un-recommended. <a href='https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/how-novelty-ruined-the-novel'>This is a good takedown</a>. So many characters are badly written sexually frustrated males and it's just all round a bad book. Couple sentences worth savoring but.. ugh.

   notes: Amor is a wonderful writer with so many lyrical touches, flourishes and turns of phrase. The feel of the book of politics, culture and acting in the proper way is great. Without posting spoilers there's a few themes in the book that make me feel like the book was written by a man - that some of the more emotionally rich moments are skipped over... But overall highly recommended as a fun, engaging and lyrical book.

   notes: I really should have read this years ago but I really enjoyed this piece. The core ideas around tempo of interactions, narrative time and that the kitchen is the best way to think about time will all stick with me for a while. Recommended.
 - title: Conversation -  How Talk Can Change Our Lives

   date_finished: 09/04/19
   notes: A delightful little book that was a gift from my friend Brian. A little meditation on conversations, how important they are and some of the explicit and implicit ways they can go wrong. At first I thought this was going to offer solutions and ideas but mostly it just offers poetry and provocations. I think it'll stick with me for a long time though - and the art from the author scattered through the book makes a lovely little object. Thanks Brian!

   date_finished: 9/3/19
   notes: A fast-paced, high-action read. A fun time-travel romp with some great characters. Ultimately I thought the premise was smart and the writing handled it well but the whole novel felt a little shallow. There were some really meaty ideas about identity and family wrapped up here that kind of got sidelined for the sake of the technology-driven plot and I thought that was a shame. Fun read though.

   date_finished: 8/25/19
   notes: Lovely vintage sci-fi recommended by Chris Butler. There's aliens, teleporting and... magic? But nothing flashy happens - it's an incredibly human story. This is a really thoughtful and fresh story. Highly recommended.
 - title: Idiots First
   author: Bernard Malamud
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Idiots-First-Bernard-Malamud/dp/0374174202
   date_finished: 8/15/19
   notes: The opening line of Idiot's First is a masterpiece. 'The thin ticking of the tin clock stopped'. Loved a few of the other stories but some were definitely forgettable. I'd recommend dipping your toe in and at the very least reading the title story Idiots First.
 - title: The Scar

   link: https://www.amazon.com/Scar-China-Mi%C3%A9ville/dp/0345460014
   date_finished: 08/06/19
   notes: Ah what delicious sludgy, dark, human texture. China Miéville's descriptive language and world building is unparalleled. This is book two (after reading Perdido Street Station last year). These books are long and luxurious so perhaps not the best entry point if you're new to his writing but if you like this kind of thing there's nothing better. My only quarrel with this book was the ending... It felt somewhat unsatisfying, or rather unfinished - where a typical book resolves this felt like the open sea was still in front of you? But it's a very minor comment as mostly the strength of this book was that every page told a lifetime of texture. Definitely going to read book three of this trilogy after a break.
 - title: Last Night
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Last-Night-Stories-James-Salter/dp/1400078415
   date_finished: 07/14/19
   notes: After reading All That Is I had to wash my palette and get back to some of his delicious writing. This was much more in line with Light Years and contained some lovely moments. None of the short stories will linger with me too long but it's a short read and I'd recommend it.
 - title: Emissaries Guide to Worlding
   author: Ian Cheng
   link: https://serpentine-galleries.myshopify.com/products/coming-soon-ian-cheng-emissaries-guide-to-worlding
   notes: The core idea of the masks - the cartoonist, the director, the hacker and the emissary - is wonderful and a new lens to look at the world through, so overall I'd recommend the book. But there was also an incredible over-indulgence from the author to live inside his own worlds (which feels very finite game like, not infinite game like). And the lack of people anywhere in his worlds is also problematic. That said - the book as an object is beautiful and wonderfully designed.

   author: Thomas M. Disch
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Prisoner-Novel-Thomas-M-Disch/dp/014311722X
   notes: I really enjoyed this - a delightfully British story of being trapped, like a combination of Kafka and PG Wodehouse. The plot derailed itself in a few places and there was a whole Shakespere reference that kind of went over my head but the writing was wonderful. Recommended.

   date_finished: 6/24/19
   notes: I really loved this. Distinctive, fresh writing that captures so much of the present weirdness in society while also somehow feeling timeless. The middle third dragged slightly for me but the descent into ecological weird towards the end is just wonderful and reminds me of the Annihiliation series by Jeff Vandermeer. Oh and the whole book centers on this premise of artists becoming 'consultants' which is magnificent. Recommended. Verdict- 👍🌲
 - title: All That Is
   author: James Salter
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WKFMGS
   date_finished: 06/09/2019
   notes: A wildly disappointing read. Not that it was so bad but that having recently read Light Years I was expecting so much more. There were moments of brilliance in the writing and some of the scenes will linger with me overall the book didn't really make me feel anything. Definitely read Light Years instead.
 - title: Borderless
   author: Eliot Peper
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BM7F9SF
   date_finished: 5/20/2019
   notes: Book two of the Analog series. Overall I connected less with the main character in this one but connected more with the overall premise which is very thought provoking. It feels today that we are actively living through the end (or at least a phase transition) of sovereignty. Compelling and a quick read.

   notes: I completely devoured this book. The characters and pace keeps it flowing but the ideas will stick with me - it's grounded in a very near future and the concepts are well thought through. Excited to keep diving into Borderless next.
 - title: The Gone Away World
   author: Nick Harkaway
   link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EL6R9W/
   date_finished: 5/07/2019
   notes: A majestic feat of imagination - whirlwind story of a gong-fu epic in a world gone mad. Definitely feels like it needed better editing or structuring and was about 100 pages too long but the strength of imagination and grasp of poetry really captivated me. Picked this up off the street on the way home from kung-fu training (approriate!). I'll be reading more of his work.
 - title: Light Years
   author: James Salter

   date_finished: 4/12/2019
   notes: This book completely destroyed me. The writing is dense and poetic like almost no one I've ever read. Did you know glass is a liquid and slowly 'flows'? This book operates on a time horizon and 'flows' through lives in a deeply transformative way.

 - title: Delirious New York
   author: Rem Koolaas

   date_finished: 3/18/2019
   notes: It's architecture writing but lyrical, magical and opinionated. A tour de force through New York's history with tons of interesting characters, ideas, explorations and more. Ideas include congestion as an organizing principle of the city, and every block being an archipelago. Wonderful and highly recommended.

   notes: Abandoned. I think somewhere in this book is buried a wonderful treasure. The looping self-aware story is fundamentally interesting and new but the language that wraps around it chokes it to death. Abandoned about half way through.
