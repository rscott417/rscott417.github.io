title: My Favourite Science Fiction
books:
 - title: The Player of Games
   author: Iain M. Banks
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Player-Games-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/0316005401
   notes: My all time fave book from my all time fave sci-fi author. Delicious, inventive, well-written scifi.
 - title: Use of Weapons
   author: Iain M. Banks
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Use-Weapons-Culture-Iain-Banks/dp/0316030570   
   notes: My second fave book from my all time fave sci-fi author! I'd probably start at the beginning of the culture series but these two stick out as being superb.
 - title: The Sparrow
   author: Mary Doria Russell
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Sparrow-Mary-Doria-Russell/dp/1501247069
   notes: A mind-bending novel of magnificent proportions. Deeply human, deeply weird and challenging to all kinds of ideas. No other book I've read has come close to being like this one.
 - title: Cosmicomics
   author: Italo Calvino
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Cosmicomics-Italo-Calvino/dp/0156226006   
   notes: Magical. Feels like reading poetry. Inventive, playful and just a joy to read.
 - title: Pattern Recognition
   author: William Gibson
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Blue-William-Gibson/dp/0425198685   
   notes: Near-future fiction that probably qualifies as sci-fi. Feels distinctly relevant to our modern age but also timeless. Fantastic writing, plots that intrigue and characters that leave you wanting more.
 - title: The Left Hand of Darkness
   author: Ursula K. Le Guin
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Left-Hand-Darkness-Ursula-Guin/dp/0441478123   
   notes: Deeply human stories told on alien worlds. The closest thing to a culture novel that wasn't written by Iain M Banks.
 - title: Embassytown
   author: China Mi√©ville
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Embassytown-Novel-China-Mi%C3%A9ville/dp/0345524500
   notes: Everything by China Mieville is staggering but this is the only one distinctly sci-fi (that I've read anyway). A story about spaceships and language, with incredible descriptions and memorable characters.
 - title: Flowers for Algernon
   author: Daniel Keyes
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Flowers-Algernon-Daniel-Keyes/dp/015603008X   
   notes: Made me bawl my eyes out. The kind of sci-fi Steinbeck would have written.
 - title: The Dispossessed
   author: Ursula K. Le Guin
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Dispossessed-Hainish-Cycle-Ursula-Guin/dp/0061054887   
   notes: Literary sci-fi that's a joy to read. 
 - title: Annihilation
   author: Jeff VanderMeer
   link: https://www.amazon.com/Annihilation-Novel-Southern-Reach-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00EGJ32A6
   notes: More biology-fiction than science-fiction but a staggering work of damp genius none the less. This whole triology is one of my all time faves from the last few years.
 - title: Light
