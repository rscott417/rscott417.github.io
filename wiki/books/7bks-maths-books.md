 - title: A Mathematician's Apology
   author: G. H. Hardy

   notes: A haunting look at a retiring mathematician who knows he is past his prime. For those who have never experienced advanced maths this is a wonderful short book that hints at the poetry and beauty involved.
 - title: Fermat's Last Theorum
   author: Simon Singh

   notes: This is what rockstar maths looks like - being lonely and scared for 10 years followed by depression and then immortality. The story of how one of the most famous problems ever was solved by a single genius. Fascinating reading. Made me cry.
 - title: GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach
   author: Douglas R. Hofstadter
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL716850W

   notes: This book is sort of about Godel's incompleteness theorem. It also changed my life. I'm not kidding! Technically challenging for most non-maths people I think but still accessible with work. Did I mention it changed my life?
 - title: Logicomix
   author: Apostolos Doxiadis
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL14996971W

   notes: If there was ever a maths superhero, Bertrand Russell might be right up there. This comic is funny, moving, emotional and accessible. Everyone should read this, regardless of how much you like maths.
 - title: Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture
   author: Apostolos Doxiadis
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL8386744W

   notes: A novel by the same guy behind Logicomix. This is a bit more mathsy but also a cracking story. More about sense of purpose, redemption and the quest for knowledge than it is about maths.
 - title: Flatland
   author: Edwin A Abbott
   link: https://openlibrary.org/works/OL118420W
   image: https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/olid/OL22587917M-L.jpg
   notes: A delightful little story about a two dimensional object wrestling with the concept of three dimensions. Poetic.
