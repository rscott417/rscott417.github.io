What we’re seeking to do, is allow the situation, and the ecology of systems
within it, to be our guide and teacher (which, of course, is a lot about
becoming more aware — including aware of the perceptual and
interpretational traps we fall into…). And sure, we’re still going to be stuck
in tunnels of our own perception, if we don’t explore the system *with*
others — who have different experiences and vantage points from which to
perceive the (eco)system (of socio-technical systems), etc. This work can
help with convening and guiding the attention of that work.&nbsp;

A lovely series of diagramming and sketching prompts to dive deeply into systems thinking.
