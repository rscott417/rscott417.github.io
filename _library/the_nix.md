Abandoned 500 pages in. I tried to keep going but just couldn't. A Very Bad Book. Highly un-recommended. <a href='https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/how-novelty-ruined-the-novel'>This is a good takedown</a>. So many characters are badly written sexually frustrated males and it's just all round a bad book. Couple sentences worth savoring but.. ugh.
