<p>Some thoughts on artist publishing:</p><ol><li><p>There are no rules about what can be an artist publication: a zine, a magazine, a book, an art-book, a pamphlet, a poster, a postcard, a set of letters. A website, a newsletter, an app, an e-book, a workshop or webinar, and/or a print on demand book distributed to bookstores (like with <a href="https://www.ingramspark.com/plan-your-book/print/print-on-demand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IngramSpark</a>). What you want to make can determine the right shape.</p></li><li><p><em>Artist publishing</em> is another way to think of it, rather than <em>self-publishing</em>. I’ve been feeling like it’s a more accurate description for a lot of what I’m interested in, and seeing my peers and collaborators do.</p></li></ol>
