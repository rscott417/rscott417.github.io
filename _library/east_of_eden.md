What a magnificent - truly epic work. I'm a big Steinbeck fan already and I think I even read this one previously but loved immersing myself in this wonderful story. The biblical theme is almost too strong at times but is richly counterbalanced by Steinbeck's incredibly loving character portraits. Amazing.
