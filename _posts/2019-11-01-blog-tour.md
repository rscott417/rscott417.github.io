subtitle: It's like cribs but for blogs

As part of [hyperlink.academy](https://awarm.space/learning/adventures/personal-websites) I recorded a video round-table yesterday where I did a blog-tour explaining my blog - from the theory of why I blog to the technical setup I use to post and edit my blog and wiki.

Think of this like cribs but only for blogs and instead of a celebrity you get... me. But this was fun! I think there's some interesting things to explore here if you're interested in blogging (and especially if you run a static site). Check [the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3UPw1zgP_Q):
