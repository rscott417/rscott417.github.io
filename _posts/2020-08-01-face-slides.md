Matt, I've really been enjoying your experiments with a more playful, expressive and distinct approach to virtual presentations. I was really looking forward to this talk (which was supposed to happen in my discord but unfortunately tech issues prevented us from seeing it - sorry!):

Not the most sophisticated setup, but flexible enough for creative experimentation in for-real scenarios <a href="https://t.co/5pxLVCwAPx">pic.twitter.com/5pxLVCwAPx</a></p>&mdash; Matt Webb (@genmon) <a href="https://twitter.com/genmon/status/1288120847484379136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But you inspired me to fiddle around with something similar, and maybe one that doesn't require you to use a virtual webcam (or fry your computer with processing!)

Basically - I had an idea that you could share screen on a tab that is displaying your webcam and have a low fidelity version - which would probably be choppy but could be fun none the less. So I made a glitch app to show the proof of concept using a full screen div with your webcam in it and reveal.js presentation on top:

Play with it yourself here:

Remixing this and making your own is [one click and easy over on Glitch](https://glitch.com/~webcam-reveal).

Have fun!
