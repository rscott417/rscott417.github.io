Toby and I have just released some new stuff for [Quotebacks](https://quotebacks.net):

You can now create quoteback embeds manually on the site - and there's a bookmarklet to quickly generate quotebacks without using the extension. Hopefully this makes the tool even more accessible and simple to use for folks.

This also opens up more customization and fiddling. Hopefully that's all good stuff.

As ever, Chrome & Firefox extensions are still there and working well.

Much love.
