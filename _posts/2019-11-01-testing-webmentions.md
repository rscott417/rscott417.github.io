This post is a test.

Here's the "stack" I'm using for webmentions:

- Set up h-card & h-entry microformat markup
- Create webmention.io account
- Add meta tags from webmention.io
- Sign up for Brid.gy for twitter->webmention.io
- Use webmention.app to post webmentions

If you're following along [this post](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2019/02/adding-webmention-support-to-a-static-site/) is excellent for getting a static site up and running on webmentions.

And apparently there is a good [Wordpress plugin that just makes this easy here](https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/1190277552704589824).
