<p>Hi there, welcome to my digital homestead. This sit covers a range of interests and identities. I have a blog where I write on media theory, consulting, blogging, architecture and other interest.</p>
<p>For the past 4+ years I've been running a boutique consulting firm called Yes! and... which is mostly just me as an embedded strategic consultant for media companies and startups. Read more about that here.</p>
<p>I also run an art collective with my partner Erin called Fiercely Curious.</p>
<p>My tinyletter is infrequent but contains insider baseball.</p>
<p>And finally my site also functions as a digital garden - I have a wiki that I maintain over here.</p>
