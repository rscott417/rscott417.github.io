Inspired by Jack&#8217;s mom&#8217;s famous creamed spinach (a staple at Thanksgiving, Easter, and other family gatherings), it&#8217;s ultra-creamy, rich, and cheesy. If you ask me, it&#8217;s just as good as any steakhouse creamed spinach&#8230;if not better. While many creamed spinach recipes call for frozen spinach, this one uses fresh. I love the silky texture of the whole, just-wilted leaves in the cream sauce. I think it makes this classic side dish feel a bit brighter and fresher.

Unlike my carrot cake cupcakes, which are firmly in dessert territory, these healthy carrot muffins are a great grab-and-go breakfast or snack. I love that they taste like carrot cake while packing in some more nutrition. They freeze perfectly too. When you have time on a weekend, make a big batch and stash it in your freezer.

In this recipe, I top the rich, creamy corn porridge with saut\u00e9ed greens, bursty cherry tomatoes, avocado, and\u2014of course\u2014a fried egg.
