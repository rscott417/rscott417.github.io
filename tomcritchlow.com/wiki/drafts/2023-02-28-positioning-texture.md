Build new marketing capabilities
subsurface: working with executives in new roles, to intentionally blur the boundaries between consulting and coaching.

Howard:
Story driving marketing and story driven employee experiences
Subsurface: production and craft is the difference. Elevating boring experiences (onboarding, training, marketing campaigns) into remarkable magical, games, stories and rich narratives.

Elan:
Help brands build remarkable stories
Subsurface: Elan is often the 4th or 5th agency. For when everyone else failed, Elan has a unique ability to cut through the chaos in difficult situations to create clarity, with positioning that's simply MORE TRUE than the people that tried and failed.

Behzod:
Helping you build research capabilities
