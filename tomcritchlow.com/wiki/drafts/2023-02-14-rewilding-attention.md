Junkfeeds -> Rewilding -> Agency







Rewilding vs monoculture

Algorithmic feeds the worst, not because they are bad feeds (quality is better!) but because they remove your agency.

It's this agency that I think is missing.

Everytime I hear someone bemoan the death of blogs or the death of RSS I simply think that it's an example of someone who has a monoculture feed. They have not tried hard enough to go deeper and go beneath the surface.
