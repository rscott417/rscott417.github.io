I used to speak at conferences all the time. I think my most active period was 2011/2012 when I spoke at about 18 different conferences and meetups all around the world including Sao Paolo, Seattle, Vegas, Munich, London, NYC and more.

Then I went to go work at Google and spoke at zero conferences.

Then I went out on my own and in the last 10 years I've spoken at 4 conferences.

I miss it. So, much like my list of startups I'd like to work with. Don't ask don't tell eh?

## SEO Professional Development

Career paths, skills needed and salary

## A presentation about blogging

I gave a presentation years ago at ianno about using hypothesis as a blogger and *loved* it.

## Digital Bricolage

Hacking, making things etc.

## How To be Indie Consulting Sustainable aka what I've learned over 10 years

No idea what kind of conference this would be 

## Executive Presentation Skills

This is probably less of a conference talk and more of a training session but 

## A Rallying Cry for the SEO industry

Ready to revisit this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsVY10ubnZo&t=292s
