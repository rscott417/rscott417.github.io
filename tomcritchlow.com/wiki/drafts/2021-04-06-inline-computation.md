Notion: backslash /
Slack: backslash / and : for emoji
Excel: =
Roam: [[

Then you have meta-tools like
Textexpander: ;
Alfred: Cmd + space

As computers get more advanced and programs get more sophisticated what if we could standardize this inline computation user pattern.

What kinds of universal patterns might we need?

reference other objects (tweets, spreadsheets, roam pages)
inline compute (manipulate data)
create variable for re-use


And what if... we're increasingly writing with the machine in the future? What's the in-line prompt for "give me some GPT3 riff here"
