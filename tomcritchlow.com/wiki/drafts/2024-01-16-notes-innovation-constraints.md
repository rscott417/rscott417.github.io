The core ideas of TOC (simplified based on my understanding) are:

1. Given a complex system with a fixed goal (like making money now and in the future) and interdependent elements (like a business), local optimizations (e.g. efficiencies) DO NOT add up to the global optimum.
2. Every such system has only a handful of bottlenecks/constraints that prevent the entire system from reaching the global optimum.
3. Any efforts to optimize the non-constraints are wasted because the throughput of the entire system is controlled by the constraints (aka weakest links). So if you try to optimize your sales but the problem is not enough demand, youâ€™re wasting your time and money.

Is the point of innovation to reveal constraints? 

Can this pair with strategic design?


Growth often requires a delicate tradeoff of value. e.g. two sided marketplace
