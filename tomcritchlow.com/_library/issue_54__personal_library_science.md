<p>Personal Library Science is defined as: <em>the discipline concerned with the organization, retrieval, and transformation of an individual's data.</em></p><p>The operative words here are: <strong>organization</strong>, <strong>transformation</strong>, and <strong>individual</strong>. Personal library science is focused on <strong>you and your data</strong>, not the existence of all data itself. More succinctly, personal library science is focused on <strong>your relationship with your information</strong>. How do we <strong>store</strong> information so that it useful at a later date? How do we <strong>transform</strong> our information into new valuable assets in different creative domains? How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of <strong>eight billion distinct individuals</strong>? How do we chronicle the information diet of a single person as they learn new things, interact with the world at different phases in their life? How do we make sure we can pass down our best knowledge to generations below? </p><p><strong>In sum, how do we manage the libraries of us?</strong></p>
