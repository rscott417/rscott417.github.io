What a magical lush book. Ugly, raw, squelchy. The opposite of the Ruth Ozeki book I just read... Popisho is full of exquisite descriptions, magical realism, surreal nonsense and raw, bloody, colorful magic. Full of gods and humans at their best and worst I absolutely loved this book. If you're looking for something that is a riot of color, emotion and humanity then this is it.
