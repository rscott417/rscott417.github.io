Oof. That concludes reading all 16 of the realm of the elderlings books. I haven't kept detailed notes on them but I'm so glad that I read them all and read them in order. In many ways Nighteyes is the main character. These last three books tie together so many threads and loose ends - the storyline is dark but the ending is magical. Robin Hobb has such a powerful command of both small characters and giant worlds.
