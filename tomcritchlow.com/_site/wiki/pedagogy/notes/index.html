<p>Education, teaching &amp; learning increasingly powers everything I work on.</p>

<p>Consulting is education: teaching clients how to do things.</p>

<p>Every consulting client is an education for the consultant.</p>

<p>Brand marketing hinges on educational experiences for users.</p>

<p>In-context, edutainment, powerful education and learning moments.</p>

<p><a href="https://education-trails.glitch.me/">https://education-trails.glitch.me/</a> - this is a stupid little prototype I built to show how a “guided learning” UX could look and feel like. I quite quickly abandoned this because I think it’s an evolutionary dead end (too forced for one thing). The one idea I did like here is using Chrome local-storage to quickly and easily generate your own “side notes” or space for reflection and notes to self while reading which I think is a great deliberate practice for learning.</p>

<p>TODO: a prototype similar to the above from the opposite end of the spectrum i.e. entirely self directed instead of forced linear learning. What would that look like?</p>
