    "content": "Why doesn't deck culture scale?&nbsp;I was talking to a friend who was early at a company that ultimately went public. He told me how the deck and meeting culture that worked at 300 employees started breaking once they reached thousands of employees. They ultimately needed to change their approach.Some of this may sound familiar to anyone who has worked at a big organization: it’s impossible to have everyone in the room for each conversation. Endless meetings don’t seem to drive consensus or clarity. “Immature oral presentations” mean that important information isn’t communicated or absorbed. When information isn't written down and shared widely, you end up with diverging perceptions of what is true. Like the Allegory of the Cave, teams see the shadows cast by ambiguous presentations and ad-hoc conversations, and end up believing a projection of reality.If decks lead to lost context, good writing is near-lossless compression of ideas. https://www.gavinyerxa.com/writing/writing-better",

A website, a newsletter, an app, an e-book, a workshop or webinar, and/or a print on demand book distributed to bookstores (like with IngramSpark). What you want to make can determine the right shape.Artist publishing is another way to think of it, rather than self-publishing.

How do we do all of this while being flexible enough for the idiosyncrasies, proclivities, likes and dislikes of eight billion distinct individuals?

    "content": "What apartment number do I live in?Its an innocent enough question that I would have been able to answer 1.57 seconds ago. Now - my heart is racing and my mind is working faster and slower than it has ever done and I’m trying to figure out if it’s apartment 2A or 2C that I live in.You see - 1.57 seconds ago my access to the net went dark. Offline. Out. Nada. Zip. Zilch. Since birth I’ve had access to the net subcutaneously - implants under the skin just under my scalp able to communicate directly with my brain. Two arrays of gigahertz processors with microtech Bluetooth.At least that’s what I’d have told you 1.57 seconds ago. Now I’m barely keeping my shit together trying to figure out if I can remember which apartment I live in.–I round the corner of Kayes Street and I’ve taken to muttering to myself - the silence in my own brain is a thunderous cacophony and unbearable. Muttering under my breath helps a little. Distracted by my own mumbling, my legs don’t have to question which apartment I live in - they guide me to 2A comfortably and my hands go into auto-pilot, placing the keys in the lock and opening the door. I’m glad at least part of my body has it’s shit together because my brain is an unreliable useless mess right now.–It’s two hours later and I’ve dug up an old iphone - back before the microtech networks were two-way and instantaneous like how we used to use iphones to communicate. Now it seems laughably archaic but holding this slim piece of metal and glass in my hand I’m able to marvel at how slick a device this is and right now it’s a life saver. I rummage for a plug and put it on to charge. While it’s charging I look around my apartment and it’s like my brain is swimming through molasses. All of my memories, thoughts, ideas are like they’re half a second too slow. With access to the net everything happens instantly (or so it feels) - but now it’s like there are little men inside my head who have to go and retrieve files stored in cabinets and some cabinets are further away than others.–I’m back online. The glowing screen of the iphone gazes unflinchingly at me. I’d forgotten what this was like. I fire up blinkchat and am overwhelmed by the constant stream of updates and chatter - everyone is asking where I am, what happened to me and if I’m ok. As soon as I read an update, 6 more pop up on the screen. My stupid regular brain just can’t keep up - everyone else is sending these messages directly from their brains via microtech and all I have are these wet stumps of flesh called hands with which to type (type!) a reply out on.  Am ok. Net went offline. Am home. All ok.This doesn’t seem to appease the beast and my iphone crashes as continuous updates and notifications overwhelm the poor device. Jeez - is that what used to happen inside my brain? No wonder life feels so slow all of a sudden.–I write my apartment number on my hand, just in case, and head out for lunch. My favorite vietnamese place is just around the corner. I walk into the cafe and head up to the counter - somewhere in the back of my brain I’m marveling at the number of things that are happening simultaneously in my body, walking, thinking, looking. See, this old lump of flesh and bones isn’t so useless after all! I’m starting to kind of enjoy this disconnection when the realization hits me like a ton of bricks. I look around the cafe in a panic. All around there are people - people that look like me, eating, drinking talking and being NORMAL. But I’m stuck. I spin around - remembering that a few years ago they got rid of the people working here - everything runs via the net. As I spin around looking around and feeling cut off a roomba spins past me carrying someones food.It’s ok, I’ve got this. I walk up to a couple in their late-20s. They’re eating pho. My favorite dish (I think?).  Hi, excuse me, I’m sorry to interrupt but my access to the net is down. Would you mind ordering me some food?As soon as the words are out of my mouth I realize what this looks like. I’m in a restaurant harassing customers, appearing like a madman, telling weird tales of being cut off from the net. The couple exchanges a glance - barely registering eye contact - and in that split second I realize that they have likely exchanged an entire conversation between them over blinkchat. My brain feels like a bike compared to their Formula 1 race cars. I feel my cheeks blush and I stammer something about being sorry to interrupt and rush out of the restaurant.–Hands deep in my jacket pockets I brace myself to the cold outside and walk fast down the street. I’m trying to make my brain go faster, better, to THINK dammit. What’s wrong with me? I can’t seem to focus at all - the dopamine loops in my brain have been optimized for so long to respond to instant, all knowing, information that I’m basically a nervous wreck without it. I imagine a mess of wires inside my brain all plugged into the wrong slots - connections firing without purpose, data flowing but me being unable to process the output. I imagine those poor guys pulling information out of filing cabinets in my brain. Sound the alarm! Red alert! We’re back in action fellas!–I’m still stung by the experience in the restaurant - the look in their eyes as they looked at me, through me - a horrific sub-human being incapable of ordering via the in-restaurant mesh. What happened to paper menus and human waiters eh? What was so wrong about all that?",

    "content": "Descending into Iceland from orbit is breathtaking if you do it right. Often you can see the northern lights, the glaciers and the glass spires of Reykjavik all contributing to a stunning vista. On my most recent trip however an absence of solar flares and cloud cover meant that I sank into a dull grey fog as the cruiser landed in Reykjavik, as if the city hid some troubled thoughts. I certainly did.I’ve been visiting Iceland for the past 12 months regularly to interview, in person, Layola - the first human being with DNA successfully manipulated via CRISPr technology. In 2018 Layola received advanced recombinant DNA configuration across her whole genome using CRISPr - essentially using natural machines made of proteins and RNA to artificially switch some of her genes on and off. The purpose of the procedure was to cure her severe autism and the procedure took 12 months of intensive treatment.Layola was the first human to receive a CRISPr procedure and the only human to receive the procedure since.There is no question that her autism was cured, and Layola will tell you she is happy with the outcome, but to call the treatment a success requires understanding the full effects of the treatment spanning Layola’s behaviour, her pre-frontal cortex, the inner workings of international medical advisory board (IMAB) and 50 years of quarantine in Iceland in a glass box and with limited contact with the outside world.–In the period 2000 - 2018 Autism was a common diagnosis. Poorly understood, we lumped the condition with ADHD and tried to pinpoint the cause on vaccines, gluten sensitivity in diet, pre-birth oxygen flow, ambient 5G radiation and many more besides.–Layola was born in 2000 in southern New Jersey in a region called south shore - now completely submerged - to two parents, Marshal and Alice. Loving parents, a middle class family and a child with autism. First diagnosed at 4 because of early learning difficulties and later confirmed aged 7 because of extreme sensitivity to touch, a lack of all spoken language and avoidance of eye contact.Aged 14 Layola was sent to a privately funded retreat - where she was supervised 24/7 by carers and given a secure compound to explore, play in and call home. What was going on inside Layola’s mind at the time was largely misunderstood at the time but her externalities were extreme. Severe self harm, extreme aversion to human contact, complete and utter dependency on specific sensory inputs such as sounds and colors.In 2018, 50 years ago this week, Layola was selected and approved for CRISPr gene recombinant therapy.–“I suppose, you could start with the words. That was the first thing I remember coming out of the autism. I had been processing sounds my whole life but never in any organized fashion - but to hear words and speaking as you and I are now - that was something entirely alien and foreign”Layola speaks with a quiet confidence, at once soothing and calculated. Each word carries a pause behind it as if each word is selected based on it’s own merit, no word more or less important than the last.–The facility where Layola lives is difficult to describe favorably - a modest secure building in downtown Reykjavik, once the cutting edge of design, connected grid-living and security but long surpassed by the technology companies now crowding the downtown skyline and subway advertising.Still, every year the IMAB and the CIA renew their contract to secure the building 24/7 with an armed staff and every 5 years a carbon/neutron probing appraisal is made of the 20-foot thick concrete walls surrounding the building. Further security details, habits, quirks and insights that I’ve picked up visiting Layola’s home over the past year are omitted from this article at the request of the CIA.–When I asked if she was happy in her home, there was a pause followed by the measured response of “I suppose I’ve never known more or less but all my needs are met and I remain content.”",

    "content": "I worked as a visual librarian when I was a young man living in Paris. A custodian of all the images, photographs, paintings and media humanity had produced.My job paid pennies and the collection was poorly organized but I enjoyed spending my days unearthing and exploring the image library. Removed from the fast paced urban living this collection of images - most designed to excite and stimulate - were calm and serene. In between boxes of photos I would stumble on advertising slogans and catalogs of rejected logos. Life size prints of magazine covers. Dust motes in the air somehow the disjointed hyper-stimulating collection calmed me.But frustration walked in the door one day in the form of the professor. I never learned his name but I did learn to despise him. Trained in architecture and working at an advertising and communications agency (while painting at night I came to understand) the professor exclaimed that he had seen every kind of image. No new images or visual media were left in his life. And he blamed me for being unable to find him new images.His imagination he claimed was exhausted. There was no more progress possible. And it was my job to satisfy him. To present him with some image or style or visual that he had never seen before.At first, as custodian and, humbly, expert of the visual archives I thought it a fun challenge to find something new.Gaudi. Pointilism. Chinese architecture. A catalog of colors. Pinhole photography.Everytime I brought the professor something he would take it in silence only to return the next week and proclaim that he had seen it before. Or that it was nothing more than a simple recombining of other derivitive forms.A book of germs was my greatest mistake. A rare 1929 thick leather bound book filled with plates painstakingly photographed through a simple microscope I thought the images arresting and fresh and somehow more urgent and important than anything else I’d give him.But when he returned with the book the look on his face was thunderous and he proceeded to lecture me until the sun went down and I missed my train home on the essence of originality and how biology and life was the most banal and reducible forms of image. Everything was biology! He exclaimed. These germs are the very mother of all images! I see them in literally every single visual scene I can imagine!And he proceeded to tear down stacks of books and empty drawers of posters as he pointed and demonstrated what was to him the same image again and again and again.My mind has not seen a new image in 20 years! Everything is but a shadow of what I have already seen! There are no new mediums and no new images! I fear we have reached the end of the visual medium!And clutching his head he rushed from the library leaving me with nothing more or less than settling dust, a single dim light overhead, scattered books and images and the crushing emptiness left behind by the weight of the end of image.Already late at night and with much tidying to be done (and anyhow as mentioned I had missed my train) I resolved to spend the night in the library. I would find an original image. I would search and strain until no image had been left un-looked at.Slowly the library returned to order. I swept and cleaned and tidied as I went but slowly and methodically as I went row by row browsing and considering all materials. I vowed to find the orignal-image-needle in the library-haystack.Eventually. With a tidy library and a fresh stack of items pulled and assembled from the archives I saw the sun peeking up out of the windows and I went home. Over tired and exhausted but quietly confident I had found original image. Surely they were obscure and to my eyes (young though I was) shared no lineage with images before or after.All through that week the stack haunted me. I knew it was a promising collection:A book on pirate flags from 1830 - written and illustrated by a real seafaring pirate.The complete archives of a small accounting firm which included diagrams and doodles in the margins of the paperwork quite unlike anything I had ever seen.A set of photographs that were untagged and unlabelled found nestled in between old magazines. I could not make out the subject or even how they had been taken but they possessed some quality that deeply unsettled me.And finally, fresh the day before, the full rejected suite of marketing materials for a brand of men’s suits that folded before the marketing materials could be unveiled. Created by a young advertising student at a local University the marketing was at once bad and original. Too literal and boring while containing some desirable insight that made me want to question every fashion decision I had ever made.The week passed like agony. Time dragging and my stack of materials taunting me with their immovability. Until eventually the professor returned.He swept in Saturday afternoon. It must have been raining outside because his rain jacket was dripping and he had the air of someone who’s head has been ducked down to avoid the wind and rain.Without stopping to take off his jacket or remove his hat the professor strode confidently into the library and with a small nervous nod from me picked up the stack I had prepared.Perhaps it was the tension in the air. Perhaps it was the rain outside and the professor did not want to leave. Perhaps it was simply the urgency he felt but the professor stopped at one of the tables by the door. My curated images in his hands, the rain dripping from his coat sleeves still he flipped quickly but methodically through the images. Making sure he saw every one.I looked at him without breathing. Waiting with tension for his verdict.Once he had finished the professor slumped back in the chair. A raindrop fell from his hat onto his cheek and rolled mournfully down his face as if the heavens were crying through him.Enough. He said. Almost too quietly for me to hear. And then again. Louder.Enough!ENOUGH! How is it that there are no new images left! How is it that I am able to understand and anticipate and deconstruct every single thing you show me? Nothing here is more interesting than a row of grey bricks on an unremarkable house in a grey city of shallow visual boring nothingness!!He was shouting now. And standing. Arms raised above him clearly aiming his frustration and anger at me but broadcasting at the same time to the gods in case they happened to be watching or listening too.You might think this powerful man with some heroic ability to understand all imagery would have cowed me but something in me snapped. I had been dancing around this library for months attempting to please him and I had worked hard to discover original and obscure works but nothing had been good enough for him.Taking the professors anger as my own I jumped to my feet shouting words that are now lost in history. Like a madman I was screaming. Whatever it was I said it clearly took him by surprise because he staggered back, taking the rain hat from his head with eyebrows raised.But something had changed in me. I stormed to the nearest pile and started ripping and tearing up pages, taking posters and making confetti, turning books into crumpled balls of paper. Scientific papers filled with diagrams from hundreds of years before fell in tatters at my feet.None of this sated my rage though and with temperature rising I continued to destroy and remove images from where they had been filed and bound and organized. I grabbed a pen - whatever had been at the front desk and I scrawled on the back of a shred of poster I had just destroyed:Original never before seen images.And then in a bundle under this “cover” page I shoved scraps of books, photograpsh, canvas, art, science, words, diagrams and every other thing.As I assembled them I kept scribbling and writing putting words on and across and over the images. “Original”, “new”, “image” or on a photograph I would write “boring” and on a painting I recognized as a piece of cubist art on canvas I wrote “lines never seen”.Eventually my whirlwind energy began to die and I felt physical exhaustion setting in. I took two large binding clips and bound my “book” together and thrust it into the professors hands.There! I proclaimed. Original images!And it was my turn to collapse into the nearest chair. Full and utter bone bending tiredness overtook me completely.The silence hung in the air and eventually I looked up at the professor.With a thin firm smile spreading across his face my eyes met his and we knew. Somehow. I had done it.",

    "content": "Gormen is my horizon and my home. This towering city of red rust stuck on the side of a dead asteroid. This crumbling outpost a legacy of a crumbling empire.I am seven when the Computer chooses me as the next Controller of Gormen. Aghast, I rebel in the only way a seven year old can. I run away. Through the corridors and hangers of this decaying city of red rust, I flee. Pursued by a great horror that I can’t name but I can feel - I flee through the great hall where the daily meal is being conducted - hundreds of people dancing in a mad orchestra of routine and tasks to feed the workers - I flee still.Through the lower levels the people of Gormen are covered in red dust, the red rust of this place literally killing them from the outside in.You never truly escape the red dust but as you climb through the the levels of Gormen somehow the air becomes thinner, purer, less dust.I run.I flee through the sleeping chambers, where the bodies of dormant workers appear like hulking beasts. To me, they appeared non-human, grotesque perhaps. Vile. Noises and smells that my seven year old body, as yet, doesn’t understand. I flee past the air vents - constructions so big that I have to crane my neck to comprehend them. Their thundering noise is somehow calming to me - reassuring that this city is still breathing, still alive, still doing what it should. The mechanics of this community are alien to me - workers and machines and servants and the high court and the mess halls and the engineers and the scientists and cooks and… I don’t understand. I can’t understand - just like Gormen the meaning of this place is layered up - layers of people, metal, rust and routine.I run.As I ascend Gormen to the higher levels, the noise retreats and is replaced with the glow of lighting that is too bright. Too false. The people are no longer covered in red rust but their eyes reflect the false light. They are empty and lifeless - motions devoid of the quickness and primal qualities of the workers of the lower levels. And yet here there is less rust. Less dust in everyone’s hair, in everyone’s clothes.The library. A place I’ve been many times for education but never on my own. I see the librarian coming towards me and truly see with my eyes the monstrosity of a creature half man, half machine. Oil sheens on his metal surfaces while his human eyes burn with a look of knowledge that appears demonic. A creature who has traded form for knowledge - to give up his humanity to become all-knowing. All knowing and ponderous. I can easily outpace him and this, finally, gives me my first taste of freedom. These upper levels are steeped so thickly in tradition and etiquette that it is as if the whirling system of people and things move only in regimented movements, a limited finite way of being - destined to repeat infinitely again and again their movements and conversations.Still I run.I lose my way more times than I can count - dead end passages, locked doors, great halls that are colder than death itself. I stumble into a room filled with dancing lights, flickering and beautiful but when I see the faces of the trapped people - wired from every part of their body and a state of rapture on their faces, drooling and muttering and smiling and laughing an empty sickly laugh, I turn and flee. Those faces haunt me as I stumble on - still running and still scared but now I have been running for so long that I am feeling free - the solid pounding of my feet on the metal floors of Gormen reassuring me that this is physical and real.What characters will there be in this story? The spiders of Gormen - the computersâ€™ eyes and ears forever creeping on, and over everything. The rust, of course. Spick who will become my best friend from the miners - his infectious laugh and real human energy in his eyes but lacking the understanding of education. Mervyn - my assistant and mentor forever faithful but forever lacking, bound to the rituals and mechanics of the system. And Braun - the first voice in the senate and the puppet master of the upper levels. But there is plenty of time for that.Still I run.Down a long, narrow corridor I emerge into the observation deck. A hundred windows blazing with the radiance of the carpet of stars in the night sky. It will take me years to find this place again, and the next time I see it somehow it won’t be as beautiful as this time. Seven years old and heir to the whole of Gormen, I am able to put aside the looming dread and gaze out across the surface of the moon. Is the towering construction of metal and people Gormen or is the moon Gormen? Where does one truly end and one truly begin? I can look out over the valleys and mountains of the moon - everywhere tinged the same red color - and look up at the stars. Like pinpricks in the curtain of night, they hang motionless and yet twinkling. I am tired and lie down to rest. Rest perched on the very edge of Gormen - as far from the belly of the beast as I can manage. Many miles overhead the machines we call crows wheel and toss in some imaginary wind buffeted by space and tracing some pattern known only to the Computer. I feel for the crows out there in space with no air and no heat. How can those machines not lose their minds? Already my brain is confusing humans and machines - already my perception of things is losing it’s grip.I will look back many years later, once I have become the Controller truly and know every chamber, every air vent and every crack in this majestic ruined place - once I understand how the rituals work and how the machine functions - the system made of humans and metal, of brains and computers. I will look back and wonder what did I know of Gormen as a seven year old? Gazing out from that observation deck - what did I know of the true nature of Gormen? This spiraling city of red rust. Perhaps, I will think, I knew it better at that age than I ever did again.",

Critics of this method point out that information is hidden from sight in folders that are often within other folders so that we have to remember the exact location of information to access it. Because of this, information scientists suggest other methods: search, more flexible than navigating folders; tags, which allow multiple categorizations; and group information management. Yet Bergman and Whittaker have found in their pioneering personal information management research that these other methods that work best for public information management don’t work as well for personal information management.source: Managing our digital stuff–  Seeking is finding things out and keeping up to date. Building a network of colleagues is helpful in this regard. It not only allows us to “pull” information, but also have it “pushed” to us by trusted sources. Good curators are valued members of knowledge networks.  Sensing is how we personalize information and use it. Sensing includes reflection and putting into practice what we have learned. Often it requires experimentation, as we learn best by doing.  Sharing includes exchanging resources, ideas, and experiences with our networks as well as collaborating with our colleagues.source: The Seek &gt; Sense &gt; Share FrameworkAnd: PKM in 34 pieces–  Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.source: As We May Think - The Atlantic–  Multi-level summaries: A new approach to non-fiction bookssource: Multi-level summaries: A new approach to non-fiction books–  In other words, deliberate practice of knowledge work requires testing knowledge, and that is achieved by doing.

This presentation explores the flipside: large urban plans that were built but never used. These now occur on every continent – the inevitable fallout of a world urbanizing at a staggering pace.

How can we re-energize adoption of RSS4) Re-brand RSSRun a kickstarter to raise funds for a design exploration around RSS to reenvision the RSS icon, workflow, and to create RSS-branded merch (Ben Pieratt would be the DREAM person to work on this)5) Create the “bloggers way” courseA 12-week course and set of cohorts that sign up for learning how to blog.If you give me seed money I’ll get 1,000 new blogs online.Other ideas:  Some kind of small-b analytics.

For that, it must remain free. In a way, I am like Max, and I’ve decided not to go back for my supper from the land of Wild Thoughts. Instead, I’ve pitched a tent inside, and put up a trading post at the periphery. Visiting me in the woods is free. Stuff at the trading post costs money.source: Where the Wild Thoughts Are (from 2011!)–  While reading The Death and Life of Great American Cities, I was struck by how applicable many of her observations were to the internet today, despite being published twenty years before its invention.  One of the most useful concepts I picked up is her treatment of public and private life, which I’d like to break down in this post.

The difficulty and monotony and odd joy of getting better at something. Groggy morning runs. Loving yourself fully and expecting that same standard of love from other people—because God, self-loathing is boring. People who make completely different choices than I do and have completely different values, but are nevertheless very happy. How they think about meaning. The ecology of our changing planet and the adjustments we’ll have to make to adapt and survive. Navigating objectification, and learned self-objectification, in a society that places great value on female beauty and youth. How to communicate clearly and kindly in high-stakes situations. Technology and its effect on productivity. Strange possible worlds. Fear, vulnerability, loss of control. Surprising statistical truths. Small things that give me joy: the smell of lemon, rain and freshly-cut wood, un-sexualized intimacy, inventive and engaging movies, children in motion.

This plot is thwarted when a priest named Blaise immediately baptizes the boy at birth, thus freeing him from the power of Satan and his intended destiny.[14] The demonic legacy invests Merlin with a preternatural knowledge of the past and present, which is supplemented by God, who gives the boy a prophetic knowledge of the future.

    "content": "The management myth - a great rallying cry for the need for humanities and human thinking and some great context on where management consulting comes from in the first place.Strategy as an unfolding network of associations (PDF) - kind of dense but fascinating case study of evaluating strategy within the context of culture:  The evidence from the case suggests that the concept of strategy can be reappraised. From strategy as a static set of choices made at a specific point in time to strategy as an unfolding network of people, shared experiences and artefacts that is constantly being remade.Of strategies, deliberate and emergent - Thanks to Thomas Hogenhaven for pointing me in the direction of this one:  Since strategy has almost inevitably been conceived in terms of what the leaders of an organization ‘plan’ to do in the future, strategy formation has, not surprisingly, tended to be treated as an analytic process for establishing long-range goals and action plans for an organization; that is, as one of formulation followed by implementation. As important as this emphasis may be, we mould argue that it is seriously limited, that the process needs to be viewed from a wider perspective so that the variety of ways in which strategies actually take shape can be considered. For over 10 years now, we have been researching the process of strategy formation based on the definition of strategy as ‘a pattern in a stream of decisions’Small groups and consultancy - by the ever brilliant Matt Webb:  I don’t think strategy can be outsourced, I think it has to emerge from a company’s nature. So when strategy evolves, there has to be organisational change. When an organisation looks outside itself (for answers that should be derived from strategy) that says to me that it’s not thinking straight, that the organisation isn’t put together quite right yet. An organisation has these informal components, and cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave them in.The art of sharing - Jan Chipchase is a master at this and I can’t wait to read the full handbook but this excerpt is especially relevant for the sharing / campaign thinking I mention above.Consultancy, Creativity and Cooking with Sunday Dinner - from the great Lindsey Slaby thinking about new ways of getting creative projects staffed, funded, connected and thought about.

Given my advocacy to getting into clients slack groups you can see why this resonated with me.The Fieldguide to Independent Consulting - ok, I’m gonna sneak one of my own links in here but if you enjoyed this post you should read this little thought-starter around independent consulting.–Venkatesh proposes that consultants get bought in when “monitoring costs” (in the coeasean theory of organization) are too high. I.e. a new type of work or one that the org does infrequently so has no way to efficiently monitor the quality of work.This maps well to my idea of ways of seeing - i.e. teaching clients how to see the work is another way of saying teaching clients how to monitor the work. Dashboards rule everything around me.Clients have problems that they describe as “I don’t know how to build this” when what they mean is “I don’t know how to measure this”.–  Yet beyond being (cognitive) labour saving devices models have another obvious virtue. They provide a shared intellectual scaffolding: a common ground upon which people can interact and engage. In that sense models have communicative virtuosity - they are good to talk with. They allow ideas to be shared.source: Models of Enchantment and the Enchantment of Models - EPIC–  I‚Äôm about to design the connective tissue between research and vision, and I‚Äôm going to use the medium of words. My ability to successfully establish a believable framework rests on my level of craftsmanship with language.source: Strategy is a Game of Language ‚Äì Modernist Studio–  WAR-type statistics track well with the increased emphasis on personal rather than organizational productivity that Melissa Gregg describes in Counterproductive, her study of time-management self-help trends. In that discourse, ‚Äúproductivity isolates and sanctifies the actions of individuals. It elevates an elite class of worker beyond the concerns of mundane others.‚Äù Productivity fetishism suits a society of free agents who must continually renegotiate the terms of their value, their viability, their irreplaceable contributions; it not only provides a rationale for employers to sort contract workers, but it provides those workers a way to frame their achievement in the absence of a stable association to a particular job or a particular set of co-workers. More and more of us are perpetually in the position of a baseball player facing an arbitration hearing. We cast everyone else as the replacement-level people that we are besting with our superior performances. To garner proof of that, we‚Äôre more likely to tolerate increasingly invasive forms of surveillance that can document our accomplishments and chart our personal growth on whatever metric is necessary, whichever seems to give us leverage over the competition, if not the employers.source: Not Relevant for Fantasy Purposes ‚Äî Real Life–High performing teams–What theorizing is not, theorizing is - (pdf)–  Learning results from the adaptive and manipulative interactions between an organization and its environments: experimental actions are important because organizations rarely master their environments so that they can develop lasting optimal responses… Long-term survival calls for surveillance of opportunities, whereas short-term coping concentrates upon problematic search. Most organizations have much of the latter and little of the former (Thompson, 1967). Yet, if organizations are to survive in hostile and changing environments, they must change strategies and pursue new development patterns. Organizational design should encourage experimenting so that organizations attain long-term viability.source: How Organizations Learn and Unlearn (Hedberg, 1981)–Contextual Wireframe Presentation by ùêåùêöùê±ùê¢ùê¶ ùêãùêûùê≤ùê≥ùêûùê´ùê®ùêØùê¢ùêúùê° on Dribbble–  A survey of over 1600 civil servants in Pakistan and India found that ‚Äúsimply presenting evidence to policymakers doesn‚Äôt necessarily improve their decision-making,‚Äù with respondents indicating ‚Äúthat they had to make decisions too quickly to consult evidence and that they weren‚Äôt rewarded when they did.‚Äù No wonder Deloitte‚Äôs Reimagining Measurement initiative, which asked more than 125 social sector leaders what changes they most hoped to see in the next decade, identified ‚Äúmore effectively putting decision-making at the center‚Äù as the sector‚Äôs top priority.source: Why Your Hard Work Sits on the Shelf ‚Äî and What to Do About It–  I think we have trouble justifying architectural investments in software engineering because, unlike in the automotive factory, our systems machinery is hidden away in a data center or ‚Äúin the cloud.‚Äù However, if we demonstrate rigor and get creative about exposing the machinery to the CEO, the justification may become a lot easier.source: Expose the Machinery ‚Äî Resilien–Indy Johar - The boring revolution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XwSZjv2DyQSystems thinking, complex systems.–  You came in as the high end consultant on rarefied air.¬† But then you stick around, and the luster wears off.¬† You eat cheeseburgers for lunch, just like everyone else.¬† And, after a bunch of months, you don‚Äôt seem as special as you used to.¬† Just one of the crew.source: The Siren Song of the Long Term Engagement - DaedTechThis is wrong!

We think at first of drawings and diagrams, but there are other forms of sketching. The OED offers several pertinent uses of the term, none of them earlier than the late 17th century. The first refers to the visual arts: “A rough drawing or delineation of something, giving the outlines or prominent features without the detail, esp. one intended to serve as the basis of a more finished picture, or to be used in its composition; a rough draught or design. Also, in later use, a drawing or painting of a slight or unpretentious nature.” The second extends it to literary creations: “A brief account, description, or narrative giving the main or important facts, incidents, etc., and not going into the details; a short or superficial essay or study, freq[uently] in pl[ural] as a title.” A third, rare usage, makes a sketch simply “[t]he general plan or outline, the main features, of anything”. One can find all three sorts of sketches at work in the formation of the new science of the seventeenth century.Source: Sketching Science in the 17th Centuryhttp://www.xplaner.com/visual-thinking-school/https://twitter.com/nicolasnova/status/1376581318637670400https://davidhoang.substack.com/p/sketching-as-a-strategy?ref=uxdesignweeklyhttps://www.amazon.com/Sketching-User-Experiences-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123740371/https://syllabusproject.org/diagrams/https://www.oarplatform.com/response/cartography-research-process-visual-essay/https://syllabusproject.org/diagrams/https://www.are.na/sim-polism/psychoanalysis-diagrams",

While the concept of co-creation is entering the zeitgeist, it is an ancient and under-reported dynamic. Media co-creation has particular relevance in the face of today’s myriad of challenges, such as the climate crisis and threats to democracy. But it is not without risks and complications. In this study we look at how people co-create within communities; across disciplines; and increasingly, with living systems and artificial intelligence (AI). We also synthesize the risks, as well as the practical lessons from the field on how to co-create with an ethos grounded in principles of equity and justice. This qualitative study reframes how culture is produced, and is a first step in articulating contemporary co-creative practices and ethics. In doing so, it connects unusual dots.source: Collective Wisdom · Works in Progress–  But what about their information architecture? Almost all of them are built in a feed structure, while the information architecture of the Internet is almost completely hidden behind the scene. There is no ‘Facebook homepage’ that presents updates, requiring you to click on the update, go to the update page, and then click back to return to the homepage.source: News media should rethink their website architecture–  “Rappers got their start by releasing rawer, uncut mixtapes to the streets. These tapes were more frequent, less polished, and had samples we knew damn well weren’t cleared! But once the artist got popular, their studio albums were more polished, had radio-friendly singles, big-name producers, and a slow song or two to broaden appeal.  When artists focus on albums and stop making mixtapes (or mixtape-type music), they risk losing the audience that fueled their rise. But if artists stuck only with mixtapes, there’s a higher chance they might never breakout. Doing both allows them to grow while staying true to their roots. That’s why Lil’ Wayne’s run from 2005-2009 was so iconic. He released classic mixtapes and albums to maintain both audiences.”source: How Tyler Perry Built a Customer-Centric Empire - Trapital by Dan Runcie",

When do our social obligations compromise our intellectual aspirations, or vice versa? And when do those social or intellectual aspirations for the library exceed — or fail to fully exploit — the capacities of our architectural and technological infrastructures? Ultimately, we need to ensure that we have a strong epistemological framework — a narrative that explains how the library promotes learning and stewards knowledge — so that everything hangs together, so there’s some institutional coherence.

After all, there is a good chance the gig economy will outgrow the paycheck economy, relegating the latter to a minority sector of the economy overall. Imagining our future in relation to the future of paycheck work would be like early industrial age workers imagining their future in terms of the future of farming. Much of the supposed “future of work” thinking I see around the gig economy strikes me as the equivalent of early factory workers worrying about where to park their cows.  So the gig economy needs to outgrow its origin story in the paycheck world. For the gig economy to grow from limited sideshow to full-blown folkway, we need to talk about a lot more, and develop much deeper internal realities and subjectivities.source: Towards Gigwork as a Folkway–  I think the question of whether or not to outsource curatorial practice is a good opening to discuss the broader practice of outsourcing in general in the cultural heritage sector. It certainly easier for more people to relate to than the question of whether or not we should outsource digital and technology roles. This is a larger debate that we, as a community of practice, should have because I think that one risk of relentless outsourcing is that museums (and friends) will become nothing more than centers of production rather than scholarship.  If we say that our only purpose is to facilitate the assembly of content in the service of culture then it’s no longer clear to me what distinguishes the cultural heritage sector from any other for-profit entertainment company. If we are unable to articulate, even to ourselves, what distinguishes our work from that produced by the private sector then maybe it really is time to admit there’s nothing special about what we do. And importantly there are other people who do it — where it is pure and selfish entertainment — better than we do.source: [this is aaronland] it’s like trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich in a toaster",

    "content": "So much of consulting is not “having the answer” but helping everyone get to the answer together. It’s about exploration and process as much as it’s about expertise and “being right”.To that end - I’m fascinated by this idea of “small groups consultancy” from Matt Webb:  There are a couple of things I’m investigating:  1) That a small group is a powerful way of thinking, and of creating action. That repetition matters, and informality.  2) It might be possible to help with strategy without providing original thought or even active facilitation: To consult without consulting. The answers and even ways of working are inherent in the group itself.  My hunch is this: To answer a business’s strategic questions, which will intrinsically involve changing that business, a more permanent solution than a visiting consultant might be to convene a small group, and spend time with it, chatting informally.You’ve really got to read the whole post here: Small groups and consultancy and coffee mornings.Open questions:  What kind of problems need this “small groups” approach?  How do the commercials work? Who gets paid what? Who has incentive to make this work?  What other models exist outside of traditional consulting?",

    "content": "I had never thought so obsessively about poetry as I did when I was learning about syntactic linguistics.There were different kinds of verbs, my professor had told me. If John threw a ball, that throwing was a doing. But if John loved Mary, my professor stressed that, within the structure of the sentence, John served as what was called an “experiencer” of the emotion of love. Loving was not a doing — syntactically speaking, of course. He drew for us two diagrammatic trees that demonstrated how the nature of a doing or experiencing verb influenced how the sentence was modeled in our internal understanding of language.There is poetry in constellations, and poetry in patterns of birdsong, but this class was how I learned about the poetry that inhabits the formal structures of language. Was the professor aware of the symphony he was plotting out on the blackboard? He was composing out loud a striking thesis on what it meant to perform the act of love, or, indeed, to simply be the experiencer of some cosmic feeling. I was desperate to learn more, especially if the professor continued to explain these concepts in a way that inadvertently sounded like a poetic proclamation. https://pleiadesmag.com/online-exclusive-a-world-encoded-by-katherine-yang/",

Rhymes with Good Conversations Have Doorknobs.And I was thinking, actually, about conversations between my wife and me. I was thinking, more precisely, about conversational “space.” We are two whole universes connected, anchored by very deep connection, but there are a thousand books worth of experiences that belong to one of us alone. You spend 17 years together and we know the easy paths to each other. They are well-marked, assiduously maintained, no poison ivy. But how much more are all of us  — are the hillsides — than the well-worn trails? Every person on this earth is a monstrously huge landscape, and yet, we can drop into any of it with a simple incantation, the right string of words piped through this sparse interface. At a bus stop, taking in two dogs playing, paying for a muffin—you might unveil a secret path to walk for a year or just a few feet. I have been blessed with my mother’s gift of easy connection to others. But what is the nature of that gift? It’s saying: hey, that seems interesting, wanna go there? As simple as stepping off the trail to point out a mushroom.Anything can open up a hillside to explore. But often, it is the components of conversations that open up the rest of me: an unexpected question, someone else’s lingering shower thought, a feral conjecture about the world, free empathy, a true thing offered, a scrambled memory reassembled in real time.Alexis Madrigal https://oaklandgardenclub.substack.com/p/a-life-project-a-simple-conversation?publication_id=1723467&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;r=k&amp;utm_medium=email",

Lots to mull over:One of the reasons I think these considerations are so important to the cultural heritage sector is that the act of revisiting is the bedrock underlying the whole idea of cultural heritage itself. The act of re-reading a book, or re-listening to a piece of music or of going to see the same painting or sculpture again and again and of celebrating the evolution of an understanding about those works is what separates cultural heritage from entertainment. Entertainment, born of the moment, can and does become cultural heritage but it is precisely through the act of revisiting that one becomes the other.The web simply makes those acts of revisiting possible for more people, in more ways, than ever before. When I say these things are possible I mean that the economics of participating in this global network of documents are within the reach of, if not everyone, then more people than ever before. These things become possible because technologies underlying the web are simple enough to meaningfully lower the barrier to participation and unburdened by licensing in a way which allows people to share their work and for others still to extend that work to meet their needs. https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2022/06/17/expectations/#usf",

When images load slowly or not at all, that can cause someone to stop using the app. That’s why we monitor an important metric to alert when there’s a regression in how images are loading for our users. That metric, %FIRE, is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, and it’s calculated as shown in Figure 1, below.Figure 1: %FIRE calculation.All kinds of things can regress %FIRE, both on the client end and the backend, but not all image-rendering bugs are covered by this metric. For example, in Threads iOS, we had a bug earlier this year where user profile photos would flicker because of how we were comparing view models when reusing them. That triggered a frustrating user experience, but not one where users would contribute to %FIRE. https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/18/ios/how-we-think-about-threads-ios-performance/",

Lots to mull over:One of the reasons I think these considerations are so important to the cultural heritage sector is that the act of revisiting is the bedrock underlying the whole idea of cultural heritage itself. The act of re-reading a book, or re-listening to a piece of music or of going to see the same painting or sculpture again and again and of celebrating the evolution of an understanding about those works is what separates cultural heritage from entertainment. Entertainment, born of the moment, can and does become cultural heritage but it is precisely through the act of revisiting that one becomes the other.The web simply makes those acts of revisiting possible for more people, in more ways, than ever before. When I say these things are possible I mean that the economics of participating in this global network of documents are within the reach of, if not everyone, then more people than ever before. These things become possible because technologies underlying the web are simple enough to meaningfully lower the barrier to paricipation and unburdened by licensing in a way which allows people to share their work and for others still to extend that work to meet their needs. https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2022/06/17/expectations/#usf",

The ideas he sketches out there go beyond publishing, to addressivity and acts of speech. In the past I used to think about publishing, and I think many people still do, as the production of objects. Like: you make a zine, you make a digital file, you make a book. I guess one thing that changed for me with Michael Warner's [piece] was the idea of setting something into motion and forming a public through its circulation, and through the discourse that's created around that movement.I started thinking about publishing in gestural and performative ways where that action, when you make objects move—sometimes literally physically moving from hand to hand or library to library et cetera, or on the network from server to sever—that is where the public, or a public, or multiple publics are being formed.

Why is this important now? What else is happening in the product or with competitors that could hinder this? Are we putting too much effort into this too soon?My second takeaway is to rethink the concept of shipping all together. We sometimes put too much importance on shipping, when deciding not to do something is often the harder, and smarter, decision—and should be celebrated. With so much weight on shipping The Big Thing, we forget how important it is to work incrementally. If it felt like we threw a lot of work away, did we bite off more than we could chew?And last, it has taught me the importance of storytelling, documentation, and leaving a record of your work.

In particular, they must support the activities of their usersby providing functionalities that may range from general utilities, like annotation,summarization or co-operative work support, to very audience-specific functions,like map processing, semantic analysis of images, or simulation. The availability ofthis new DL functionality can, in principle, change the way in which research isconducted. By exploiting such types of DL, for example, a scientist can annotatethe article of a colleague with a programme that extracts useful information from alarge amount of data collected by a specific scientific observatory. Thisprogramme, executed on demand when the annotation is accessed, cancomplement the content of the paper with continuously refreshed information.In the new DLs users are not only consumers but also producers ofinformation. By elaborating information gathered through the DL they can createnew information objects that are published in the DL, thus enriching its content.The new DLs are thus required to offer services that support the authoring of thesenew objects and the workflows that lead to their publication.&nbsp;Donatella Castelli https://www.researchgate.net/publication/28804446_Digital_Libraries_of_the_Future_-_and_the_Role_of_Libraries",

When it’s through play that we do our best learning…Let me start with a contrarian point-of-view: I don’t like edutainment.What do I mean by that? Am I a stodgy professor who wants to keep play and fun out of thelearning process? Certainly not. In fact, my research at the MIT Media Lab focuses on ways tointegrate play and learning. I have found that many of people’s best learning experiences comewhen they are engaged in activities that they enjoy and care about. Based on these ideas, Ihave helped develop new toys that provide children with opportunities to learn as they play (andplay as they learn).So why don’t I like edutainment? The problem is with the way that creators of today’s edutainment products tend to think about learning and education. Too often, they view education as abitter medicine that needs the sugar-coating of entertainment to become palatable. They provide entertainment as a reward if you are willing to suffer through a little education. Or theyboast that you will have so much fun using their products that you won’t even realize that youare learning—as if learning were the most unpleasant experience in the world.Mitchel Resnick https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/edutainment.pdf",

The centers that monitor for danger, including the amygdala, go into overdrive, triggering a release of “fight or flight” stress hormones. Your heart rate rises, your blood pressure and blood sugar level increase to provide energy in case you need it. Your body produces extra inflammatory cells to repair tissue damage and prevent infection, and fewer antibodies to fight viruses. Subconsciously, you start to view other people more as potential threats — sources of rejection or apathy — and less as friends, remedies for your loneliness.@nytimes https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/nyregion/loneliness-epidemic.htmlThis kind of insight is validated by this long Harvard study. In particular, it’s not just that relationships matter - but the quality of relationships in midlife…The study showed that the role of genetics and long-lived ancestors proved less important to longevity than the level of satisfaction with relationships in midlife, now recognized as a good predictor of healthy aging. The research also debunked the idea that people’s personalities “set like plaster” by age 30 and cannot be changed.@harvard https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/One way out is to strengthen our trust in institutions and communal care. Not to give people support but to ask them for support:“For years people thought the best thing you could do for a lonely person is to give them support,” she said. “Actually, we found that it’s about receiving and also giving back. So the best thing you can do for someone who is lonely is not to give them help but ask them for help. So you give them a sense of worth and a chance to be altruistic. Even if we’re getting the best care, we still feel lonely if we can’t give something back. The care is extremely valuable but it’s not enough.”@nytimes https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/20/nyregion/loneliness-epidemic.html",

It either functions as an instrument to integrate new generations into the logic of a present system, or it can be the means by which students are allowed to critically deal with their reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their future—in other words, education as a practice of liberation. No matter what we believe, we all should at least be transparent about our approaches. Every student should have the right to know what kind of learning processes they are about to enter.And of course, one is more likely to support education as a model of integration if one benefits from or has never felt threatened by the status quo. In this case, this system is likely invisible to you. In liberatory educational practices, it is as important to recognize one’s role as an educator as it is to identify and name power. This should never be confused with freeing yourself, as a teacher, from your responsibilities. Even if I believe in co-created knowledge and use methods to make individual experiences and knowledge visible, it is my responsibility to organize studies in ways that increase each student’s chances to reach learning outcomes. If a student fails, this failure is also mine.@futuress_org https://futuress.org/magazine/teach-what-you-need-to-learn/",

For Bald and Bankrupt, it is an obscure historical Soviet site. For GeoWizard, it is the endpoint on a straight line across a whole country. For Craig Mod, it is a small cafe along a Japanese walking route. They do a lot of walking.

It’s your own unique course title. It frames your goals, challenges or curiosities as a site for active exploration and response. It’s an itch you have to scratch.It’s important that a Learning Question be open. Open questions are ‘designed to encourage a full and meaningful answer using the subject’s own knowledge and/or feelings’. They are the opposite of closed questions which encourage single-word answers.Similarly, a Learning Question is designed to encourage a full and meaningful enquiry. It’s more about provoking a process of learning than about finding an answer, but if you do seek an answer it must be one that incorporates your growing knowledge and personal perspective.Very often a Learning Question spawns a series of new questions which continue to move you forward and help you grow. Unlike an academic thesis question a Learning Question does not seek resolution as an enormous written paper! It seeks a creative response appropriate to the question.The question can be seen as an externalisation of an inner purpose that is of great importance to the learner. This importance could be practical and immediate (e.g. ‘how can I gain the skills I need to get promoted?’) — or more philosophical (e.g. ‘what is hope and can it be designed?’).Zahra Davidson https://medium.com/enrol-yourself/how-to-find-your-learning-question-and-why-you-should-645fe62b7904",

But what does ‘Internet of Natural Things’ mean? Well, throughout history, societies have collectively reinvented their image of nature, so it’s logical that we are now defining a new image of nature for the post-digital age. And with that comes a new and more authentic idea of beauty that designers can embrace.The research has many strands. I’m exploring biophilic thinking in art, design, architecture and emerging tech. There’s great overlap with mental health and wellbeing. I’m particularly interested in the ways data and social media help us track animals, invest in them, and crowdsource their stories. I’m fascinated by how all of these strands coalesce to influence culture and aesthetics.I want to understand how nature can play into a better relationship with digital technology, and how technologists and designers can work with, not against, the natural world.

The faster we can iterate, the faster we can discover good ideas. Things aren't perfect today, but tomorrow things can be slightly closer to perfect.Incremental correctness changes everything about the way you work. It's anti-perfectionism. It's pro-generation. It's about discovery and proof, research and prototyping, and having a framework to reliably test your instincts. It discourages major redesigns, preferring isolated improvements to a small subset of nodes in any kind of working tree.I've always struggled to have this mindset when working on my personal website. I get stuck in these loops where I redesign the thing once every few years, and am left so thoroughly exhausted and frustrated by the process that I don't want to touch the thing ever again. If you've ever dreaded the notion of having to redesign your portfolio, you probably know what I mean.@brian_lovin https://brianlovin.com/writing/incrementally-correct-personal-websitesPaired with Frank Chimero, on digital homesteading:Have you ever visited an architect’s house, one they designed themselves? It’s fun to walk through it with them. They have so many things, arranged so thoughtfully, and share the space with such pride because of the personal reflection the house required to design (not to mention the effort it took to build). It’s really quite special. I think there’s a pleasure to having everything under one roof. You feel together, all of you at once.

But also great commentary and exploration of the power dynamics against “building a brand” or “being very online”This week’s intra-mural media kerfluffle revolves around backlash to the idea that journalists need to be brands themselves — apart from the institutions they work for. It was precipitated by an article in Insider about The New York Times and retention problems potentially caused by the Times’ approach to outside projects.At the center of this conversation on Twitter were two high-profile Times journalists, Maggie Haberman, and Taylor Lorenz, the latter of whom recently left the Times for The Washington Post. The short version of what happened is that Lorenz pointed to the Insider article (in which she is quoted) and affirmed that it’s important for younger journalists especially to develop themselves as brands and Haberman responded by accusing Lorenz of attention-seeking, and a host of other established journalists chimed in with whatever the Tweet equivalent is of a vomit emoji, mostly triggered by the word “brand” but also by the dynamic at play between Lorenz and Haberman.Elizabeth Spiers https://espiers.medium.com/do-journalist-need-to-be-brands-5e0510dfa67b",

    "content": "“Specific curiosity as a driver of creativity”The present research examines the causal relationship between specific curiosity and creativity. To explicate this relationship, we introduce the concept of idea linking, a cognitive process that entails using aspects of early ideas as input for subsequent ideas in a sequential manner, such that one idea is a stepping stone to the next.Study 1 demonstrated the causal effect of specific curiosity on creativity.Study 2, a field study of artisans selling handmade goods online, found that experiencing specific curiosity predicts greater next-day creativity.Study 3 demonstrated idea linking as a mechanism for the effect of specific curiosity on creativity.Study 4 further established the impact of idea linking on creativity, finding that it boosted creativity beyond the well-established intervention of brainstorming.We discuss specific curiosity as a state that fuels creativity through idea linking and idea linking as a novel technique for creative idea generation.Lydia Paine Hagtvedta, Karyn Dossingerb , Spencer H. Harrisonc , Li Huangc https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329542696_Curiosity_made_the_cat_more_creative_Specific_curiosity_as_a_driver_of_creativity(Paper via here and freely available with a Google)Some interesting insights from this:  Maintaining an active list of “open questions” might make you more creative. Is there a way to reframe your general interests into a list of questions? I did something a bit like that with my areas of inquiry post recently  Doing things leads to questions leads to creativity leads to doing things…. There’s a nice virtuous cycle here where finding specific problems - i.e. specific questions leads you into a positive cycle of curiousity and creativity…Update: I wonder if there’s value in a little tool/prompt/exercise that encourages people to convert their general, abstract interest into a set of active questions. I have a hunch that if you can push people into a question mindset they can be more focused, more creative, less distracted and more likely to spend time on their interests….",

As I shift more towards an independent model where I’m able to dictate my schedule a bit more (vs clients dictating it)….Seasons &amp; WorkWhen I look at the last eight years since I started working, one theme that stands out is how my work seems to move in seasons.I typically go through some significant work shift or change around the end of the year or the beginning of the next. A bit under a year ago I was stepping out of Growth Machine and starting on my rapid career sampling.The year before that, it was diving into Roam and creating the course as well as opening the Cafe (ouch).Before that in different years it was starting Growth Machine, starting my current blog, starting my first startup, getting into content marketing, starting my first blog... it's always around that time.Spring and into Summer are also often characterized by an intense focus on some project. Last year that was getting Growth Machine through COVID. This year it was learning programming.In the fall, I tend to be less productive. Not sure why. Maybe it's a relic from school starting and me resisting doing anything related to school until the absolute last minute. Whatever the source though, it tends to be a slower season.I rather like this ebb and flow. Six to nine months of focused output, a period of rest, a period of reflection and planning, then another push forward.Nat Eliason https://www.nateliason.com/medley/282",

What’s the next frontier? This brings us to our final can of worms in this series: What would a public library look like on the internet? This question is so intriguing, yet so complex and nuanced, that many of you had a lot to say on the subject last week in our most engaged Open Thread in months. Some of you thought that anything attempting to replace libraries digitally was inexorably doomed to fail, and others were eager to bring their favorite features of their library — from shushing librarians to storytime — to some corner of their daily digital routine.&nbsp;We believe this conversation is just getting started. We did a Library Design Sprint with librarians, designers, and researchers in summer 2020, and we tracked how Brooklyn Public Library went online early in the pandemic in our Terra Incognita project. This is a topic we’re still extremely interested in, and I’m looking forward to revisiting it in future newsletters.

This second idea is a more subtle one, so we’re going to spend a bit of the time examining the implications.I think many of us have been exposed to a particular style of teaching in school, where we are taught a concept, and then the examples that illustrate that concept are treated as disposable. My go-to example for this is how we are taught quadratic equations — we are shown one or two examples and then we are expected to memorise the general approach for solving such equations. As a result of this instruction, many of us internalise that concepts are important and examples are not.@commoncog https://commoncog.com/blog/how-note-taking-can-help-you-become-an-expert/",

Enchantment as such elevates the experience beyond its mere factual or physical essence, and brings it into a \"super-sensible\" relation with the actor.

Many of them feed on the energy they steal from the electricity distribution network of cities and interact with their environment by moving and emitting sounds to communicate with other parasites of their species, forming part of the urban soundscape. https://gilbertoesparza.net/portfolio/parasitos-urbanos/",

Instead, inspired by values introduced by Apple in the late 1990s, the tech review industry prioritizes aesthetic lust as the primary critical factor for evaluating objects. The reification of these values in their scoring system is transmitted to consumers and manufacturers alike. Like other prurient things, the objects designed within this paradigm are optimized not for usefulness but for photogenic and telegenic properties, a framework that finds its fullest realization in YouTube reviews and unboxing videos. There, even the intimation of critical rigor within tech reviewing vanishes, the smartphone becomes the center of gravity, and manufacturers are even further incentivized to design products for end consumers who are less users than viewers. https://components.one/posts/the-new-pornographers-tech-reviews#1And…Google caused a stir in the affiliate sector with its April algorithm update. The latest update promised better rankings in Google searches for websites with product reviews and product testing that include unique and useful expert content, while affiliate sites focusing only on clicks and commissions rather than providing the user with added value would be downgraded. So far, the update has only been rolled out for English-language Google search where some major changes have already been seen. https://blog.searchmetrics.com/us/google-product-reviews-update-april-2021/",

These books are long and luxurious so perhaps not the best entry point if you’re new to his writing but if you like this kind of thing there’s nothing better. My only quarrel with this book was the ending… It felt somewhat unsatisfying, or rather unfinished - where a typical book resolves this felt like the open sea was still in front of you? But it’s a very minor comment as mostly the strength of this book was that every page told a lifetime of texture. Definitely going to read book three of this trilogy after a break.",
