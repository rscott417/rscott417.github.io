So I got webmentions set up working on my site and Kickscondor [replied](https://www.kickscondor.com/comments/heya-tom/):

Thanks Kicks! (can I call you Kicks?). I think you're right - that it's a complicated machinery but I think I can already begin to see the power and utility.

Am I ready to become a believer? Perhaps but not quite yet - I think that it's still too complex for most people and sites.. But we'll see! Fun to experiment with. Thanks for the encouragement.
