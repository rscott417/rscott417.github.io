If Medium is elevator music, indie blogging is punk.

I had lunch with a good friend [Howard](https://www.howardgray.net/) today and we got to talking about blogging.

But it's more than that - it's about using the web to form connections and networks. It's why I call it networked writing.

In order to do that we need to bring a sensibility to our writing - to our personal space. Writing style brings out some of that but there's room for play too. It's partly why this blog has a bunch of neon green all over it. Green is my favourite color (and I design in Google slides - [see my post 00ff00 for more](https://tomcritchlow.com/2017/09/22/00ff00/)).

But there's more - we think too much of content as being about *information* - as being about the thing we're writing about. But... that's not it chief. I don't know how to articulate this yet but there's an idea around shared mental models, a shared canvas for connection. The *network* is the unit of blogging - not the post.

And building networks is about *connection*. That needs an emotional texture beyond unsplash photos, beyond Medium.

Maybe... Blogpunk?

Looking forward to Howard's post following our chat. He riffed about this idea in his notebook (and he knows more about punk than I do...)
