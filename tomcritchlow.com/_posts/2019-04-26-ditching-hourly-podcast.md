This was a great conversation where we spent most of our time discussing my article [The Strategic Independent](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/04/04/the-strategic-independent/) but we also got into some interesting territory about the language you use to describe projects, engagements, value, pricing etc. Good stuff. Thanks Jonathan!
