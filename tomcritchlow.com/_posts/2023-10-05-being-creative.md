I just launched a new thing (the [NEW MBA](https://newmba.co)) so starting and launching is on my mind. Here are a few links that I deeply love about starting, finishing and promoting *creative acts*...

## If you want to be a writer, you should be writing

The wonderful Ze Frank - *"The first piece of advice is pretty simple, it's just if you want to be something, start being it. If you want to be a writer, you should be writing, not tomorrow, but today."*: (6 mins)

## Finish your projects

A wonderful meditation on self-promotion and self-sabotage (two sides of the same coin!):

The routine theory you hear about self sabotage is that it gives us the illusion of control. I don’t think that’s right: it gives us the reality of control. It is possible to have control in life, in the sense that it is possible to guarantee your own unhappiness. And that can be safe — if unhappiness is familiar, and even in some ways preferable, to encountering a version of yourself that scares you. The versions of ourselves we will not tolerate are powerful. I think that self-sabotage is often activated purely to retain control over whether we encounter them.

Anyway, I guess my point is that you should start. Today. Be loud. Make yourself bigger. Become the best possible version of yourself.
